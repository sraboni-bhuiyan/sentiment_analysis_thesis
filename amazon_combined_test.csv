runs too way largebr size chart mention is completely wrongbr dnt waste money,0
beautiful pendant necklace however it is pink i bought it to go with a faux ruby ring no match,1
the adjustment moves too easily for me it loosens as i wear it through the day,1
not what i wanted,1
runs small,1
we didnt think it was even worth it to send it back the size of the head phones for a babytoddler are un reasonable and way to small we were so disappointed,0
i loved the way this wallet looked but the snap broke the 2nd week i had it id buy it again if they could promise me the snap wouldnt break it goes great with my purse i bought from amazon which i love,0
this is very soft and comfortable i expected this to be a little longer than it is judging by the photos its also see through that was disappointing toss a cami under it and everything is fine,1
very well constructed nice weight and looks great this is a really good buy the thoughtful packaging options and extra extender are great as well id purchase from this seller again without hesitation,2
got this for my friend who loves golden girls she loves the shirt,2
this item would been more functional if was a little bit wider and a least one or maybe two more pockets,1
as any mont blanc product this are very stylish and a1 quality very top,2
i like the whole waist band i thought everything was connected but it is all separate pieces but it still gets the job done the torso part is not as long as i thought either or i might just have a long one lol,1
the buckle has a larger profile than the webbing this limits the pants with which it can be worn,1
not even sure ill wear this one,1
its getting harder to find white underwear at brick and mortar stores and most of the white undershirts tend to be vnecks or sleeveless these were on sale and appeared to be a good buy,2
favorite hat for the gym,2
theyre like a tight pair of joggers instead of baggy sweatpants completely seethrough in the back you can see the tag and your underwear right through them dont purchase trust me,0
no small pocket,0
so many of these had the plastic missing or coming off leaving damage on the product,1
dont even dream of trying to get this thing on a commercial airplane it is huge they should have made this clear in the description so i am mentioning it here do not buy this to take on an airplane as it is way bigger than the airlines will accept solid bit of kit though and probably will last for ages the size just below this is fine as i order that at the same time and took it aboard my us airways flight to spain,1
i am a small to medium and usually a pant and top size 8 the medium fit perfectly and was not baggie the item was lackluster and didnt really have any appeal to it once i tried it on the cords were too long and too short and difficult to even out from the hood the seam with the plaid to the black showed the plaid fabric to be stretched so much that the threads were white the major thing that made me return it was the really strong chemical smell the outside of the bag didnt smell at all the fabric smelled like it was saturated in some preservative chemical super gross bothered my asthma sealed it back in its bag and returned,0
i usually wear a l or xl in leggings i couldnt get these past my hips,0
i love the way these little socks look but unfortunately i cant wear them i have rather small feet so 66 12 but these were too short for me although the silicone band around them wanted to stay up the shortness pulled them down off my feetbr if your feet are smaller than mine you will love them if your feet are larger than mine i dont advise getting thembr the seller was great and gave speedy delivery,1
fit great nice stretchy fabric that allows you to look great and yet breathe at the same time,2
this didnt provide enough support for running with a 34ddddd so i returned it,1
great my daughter is going to love it and it isnt light and cheaply made,2
mine only works once in a while cost 75 to program it so i dont want to send it back,0
it was the perfect size and it works exactly as i hoped,2
the decal is not soft at all its like it layered 10 xs with the same decal im afraid its going to come off in the wash its already peeling after 1 wash i loved the look of it just wish it was made with quality materialbr my rating is really a 25 but i rounded up because it is cute,1
love it,2
broke first time i put them on my daughter had to gorilla glue but still didnt work,0
too small,0
exactly what i wanted for work i picked the color black because sunlight is naturally drawn to the color black it heats up quickly keeps me warm during the physical activities i do on a daily basis,2
i love them actually i just happened to get 5 8mm and 1 6mm so thats why the star off made a pair unusable but its fine as i got a 3pk for extras so itll work without that 1,2
after reading all the review i purchase this skirt in a xxl i am usually an large the waist band was a bit tight but the skirt is so beautiful you can dress it up or down i am 55 and with heel its on drag on the floor just a friendly reminder,2
felt cheap,0
i liked the idea of these but they tend to slip off if you have long hair pretty aggitating especially while youre trying to workout,1
loved this dress it was a little bit ill fitting the lining underneath wasnt 100 sewed correctly wouldnt stay straight but its an awesome dress,1
the dress has far less skirt volume than i expected the fabric is pretty looking but feels plasticy it is still cute but thin the ties are a bit odd in the back but help hold the shoulders in placebr it is a cute concept and good for photos but probably not an ideal summer dress maybe spring when its not too hot yet since i doubt the fabric will breathe much still very cute just not what i hoped for as far as volume and feel,0
exactly what i was expecting my son loved itbr fits really nicebr follow me on amazon for more,2
the quality of cotton was pretty thin great for summer use,2
love these shoes i love every pair i have bought from the jessica simpson line so comfy,2
the fabric had no life to it it was like purchasing a piece of used clothing because it was so limp,0
these are so cuteeeee,2
these are sized correctly and im 5o9 and theyre long enough id like them a tad longer but theyre fine not much support in belly area and they do not look like the picture of the pair i ordered theyre cheaper looking and much lighter,1
broke off on first day wearing it,0
this is the exact material i am looking for light and cozy but if u r not in fit shape it could be looked bad on you it is adhesive to you body and accent ur body curve,2
jeans were too small this may have been due to me not noticing that these were juniors sizing also the jeans did look the same as the ones pictured in my opinion,0
absolutely tiny im 56 150 lbs i ordered xtra large for a very roomy fitit is super short and tight its from china has to be teen sizing so disappointed,0
super cute it was right around my chest i normally wear a medium but i ordered a large,1
a nice soft warm robe,2
so comfortable and beautiful fits perfectly,2
love the way it for,2
not sure size,1
very pretty a bit to high for my 7 year old she would walk funny in them,1
it came as a returned item and was stained otherwise cute,0
for the price i paid the quality was no where near what i should have received the fabric is not denim dyed like denim and feels very cheap may be asking for a refund even though i usually chaulk it up to live and learn,0
the magnets arent strong enough to hold the outside in place it just falls off,0
poor quality runs very small the return center said the company would email me a return label but they only sent and authorization slip i cant find any address or phone number for this company,0
over priced for a cheap cheap chain and thin fabric,0
these are really nice shirts ive bought several for my son they have vivid colors and silky feel wash up on regular cycle and hang dry comes out great every time,2
returned too big doesnt fit well material is nice though,0
too small not worth it,0
if i could give this no stars i would within 5 minutes of using this product the entire lens popped out on one side causing the goggle to fill with water do not waste your money,0
the material is thin and cheaply made so disappointed,0
they were more than i expected my favorite shoe now,2
they work fine however my husband still tries to slip them through all the laces we go round and round about this i am trying to get him different laces that will be easier for him to use any suggestions,1
the dress fit really well and the material was nice and soft but stiff if that makes any sense the collar stands up really well but the problem is that its quite loose while the remainder of the dress fit me well maybe my shoulders arent broad enough it would kind of puff up and i would readjust and pull it back down and it would lay flat and look great then i would walk around the house and raise my arms and move around and the shoulders would work their way back up again it would be too much work for me to keep pulling it down i realllllly liked the look of it though so im kind of sad that im returning it,1
its not like presented in the picture it looks more like a fabric surgicalstyle mask with ear loops it did however come with the 2 filters for the mask which is coolbr br overall summary did i get the mask in the filter no did i get the 2 filters though yes would i buy it again probably notbr br oh yeah and it does not glow,0
the first day my daughter wore a pair they developed a hole in 1 hour so we tried another pair and they got a hole,0
i purchased this dress as well as the asymmetrical hem of the same design and quite liked both however i found that the symmetrical hem on this one was not as flattering contributed to making me look bulky whereas the asymmetrical hem was very flattering contributed to making me look sleek and stylish i ended up returning this dress and keeping the asymmetrical hem cut but would have kept this one if the asymmetrical hem cut hadnt existed as i liked it well enough but i dont need two almost identical dressesbr br the sizing is indeed somewhat small i ordered larger than normal because i am actually pregnant and want to be able to use these as maternity dresses its very forgiving around the hips but the arms are tight as you can see in the photo please forgive the poor photo quality despite sizing up the arms are much too tight to be pushed up as long as youre okay with wearing them down to your wrists all the time this should not be a problem for youbr br as many have noted the fabric is thin not so much as to be seethrough at least not in the olive color but be sure your bra smooths down well under it seams all seemed to be in good order having kept the other dress in the same fabric i can say that it washes well but that youll want to wash on delicate and be sure to linedry or im sure it will pill up quicklybr br regarding the pockets well i really love a dress with pockets and really wanted them to work out but the truth is the fabric is so thin that putting anything even something relatively light like house keys in the pockets will pull at the fabric so much that it completely distorts the look the dress okay in an emergency but these are not dailyuse pockets alas,1
i ordered a large in this top i usually wear a size large or extra large and this top was way too tight i ended up giving it to a friend since i wouldve had to pay more in shipping to return it than i paid for the shirt itself definitely order a size or two larger,1
pretty but not full more of a head scarf,0
i like them but have only used them a handful of times here on vacation i discovered theyre coming apart terrible quality adhesive,0
nice shirt for cost,2
i got this in coffee to replace a favorite burnt orange skirt that got stained the color is more medium warm brown than the orangey color in the picture but i really like the skirt so im keeping it it looks great with a tee shirt and sandalsbr for reference im 5634 160 lbs with a 3134 waist 4134 hips i was expecting the waist to be too tight which i cant stand but its very comfortable the length on me is just below the knee for reference i usually wear a size 810 in skirts and 30 in jeansbr the fabric is kind of heavy but it feels ok in the nyc heat so far,2
i love these leggings they look so much like real denim its nearly impossible to tell the difference just looking at them the stitching is just like it is on a regular pair of jeans the back pockets are real and stretchy too but the front ones are fake and so is the zipper area it makes for a lot less bulk at the waisthip area which is all stretch the sizing is true and if not exact they are forgiving the inseam is approx 30 inches when new they fit the legs snug like leggings should and they didnt bag out at the knees by the end of an 8 hour day if youre fortunate enough to not have a muffin top in them theyd look great with any kind of top however for this 53 year old they look great paired with a tunic length top and a pair of ankle boots the fabric is soft and stretches easily it doesnt feel like youre wearing jeans but it definitely looks it i bought the midnight rinse and strongly recommend washing them separately before wearing or at least only wash with very dark clothes i pre washed mine in the sink and the water turned dark blue i just wore them today so i need to rewash them but im going to do them in the sink again just to be safebr update the water turned blue in the sink again it wasnt as dark this time but im still glad i washed them separately next time theyre going in with all my regular dark clothesbr br feb 1 2015 update its been just over 3 months since i first reviewed these jeans ive worn and washed them with regular dark loads many times now and theyre holding up well no noticeable shrinkage of the waisthip area and only a scant 12 inch shorter on the inseam the color midnight rinse has faded only slightly they are still a dark inky blue ive purchased a few other colors and am very happy with all i highly recommend the hue brand and if you keep your eye out you can find them at discount prices here on amazon as well as through ebay i prefer buying here on amazon for the free shipping andor returns policy i bought a pair recently that were sort of irregular sent them back for a refund and it didnt cost me a dime as for the irregularity seeing as i now own 5 pairs of hue jeans and 4 of their denim skirts and they all look and fit fine thats not too bad,2
love these,2
i purchased this leotard for a dance class my daughter has worn it three times and it has been washed in cold water and laid flat to dry one time we purchased a size small and she is 4 yearsoldbr around the neckline the leotard has started getting fuzzy there are several areas where the material has been snagged it is noticeable and as it is brand new i am disappointed and wont be purchasing this leotard again in the future,1
this dress runs so big and doesnt have anything fitted about it its like wearing a box i am 8 months pregnant and the small was still huge,0
this one is a new for me im very happy with it and will buy again fast shipping and good product,2
i got these because i was having trouble finding water shoes for an infant size 4 this seemed to be the only option they stay on even fbough theyre definitely still about a whole size or so too large the design is cute but after 1 use they look scratched up on the design theres white fibrous kind of hairs sticking out my twins cant swim yet so they were basically just holding onto us not scraping their feet anywhere both of their sets of shoes are like that not the end of the world but these are not built to last ok for babies but i wouldnt get them for an active toddler theyd get destroyed,1
as pictured perfect for mini gifts for friends colleagues or stocking stuffers only negative is i didnt like the patterns good value for price,2
this is not jasper im not sure what it is these are round beads and look nothing like they were advertised im disappointed,0
not bad,1
these earrings have felt light backing and the earring backs are made of light plastic they are pretty but are not durablebr br the black pair looks like a deep blush graybr br dont think you will receive strong durable earringsbr br not truly satisfied,1
a couple of them came broken,1
i havent used this type of belt in at least 10 years ive been using stretch belts thinking theyd hold the pants up better i order this belt as a test since its not very expensive i used the chart which indicated to order one size up from your waist size which i did it seems a tad long the old adage you get what you pay for is true most of the time and is here for sure its an adequate belt that is serviceable but not one that i would consider going out worthy my next belt of this type will be one more appropriate for all occasions and hopefully a bit thicker,1
i was really excited about these shoes they came on time and the color material and tailoring is very nice unfortunately the sizing seems a bit off i usually wear a size 6 and these were huge so i had to return,1
i try to order one size for myself and it usually runs correct not so with this misassy shacket i was expecting it to be on the large size as they mention oversized shirt but what came was really large the body of the jacket was fine as it was a good coverup for my other garments of the day i have short arms so was expecting the sleeve to be too big but these sleeve were huge the shacket will work for me as a form of a duster jacket to throw on when making short trips to the store it will also work going to exercise yoga classes as a cover up of workout clothesbr br i loved the color i choose as this beige color will match up with what ever i am wearing at that day the material of this jacket was fine and will wash and hang dry so easy to care for there are times when an over sized coat will work to keep you warm as a coverup on quick trips shopping,1
looks cute only thing is im not feeling the silver thought the necklace was all rope it has a silver lobster and links also it looks like it will break at the part where the pendant is connected to the chain but all and all its really cute and weight a great size,1
ordered this for an event tomorrow shipping was slow the dress itself is better quality than i expected the belt is not so i am using my own brown belt and i didnt like the ribbon for the corset so i bought some leather cord at my local craft store with these easy fixes i find it looks great and cannot wait to wear it for halloween,1
loved these shoes at first but not so much now they want stay on the velcro doesnt work anymore going to send them back,0
these glasses hurt my eyes,0
my daughter likes it thats all that matters,2
i have several pair of this style very comfy cute enough to wear to work with skirts,2
very average not enough cotton but i should have checked before i bought them rib on top is unneeded and you may feel it depending on the shoe you wear the no slip works and socks dont move and fit properly,1
these caps are huge even after washing and drying,0
they were a little tighter then i expected but im walking the tightness out theyre getting more comfortable so good to go,1
i love this sweater im picky about sweaters and dont like any that feel scratchy this is perfect its soft and doesnt feel scratchy at all its a little thinner than the bulkier sweaters which i love the thinner look also makes it more form fitting and not so big lookingbr br i usually wear a size medium which is what i ordered in this and it fits true to size i like the length of the waist its low enough to cover my whole abdominal area and i can pull up the band if i want it to sit higher i also like the color of this sweaterbr br the vneck is perfect for when i want to add a dainty necklace to the look there isnt anything about this sweater i dont like,2
i bought these shades for my husband and he absolutely love it will be buying more colours soonthank you,2
good quality love the three pockets,2
i like it glad it has arrived finally,2
summer tops,2
this is not a sweater its more like a sweatshirt material i was not a fan,1
i like it all,2
i have 3 other sweatpants by aeropostal and they are all great keeps me warm at 34f comfi and look great i bought these expecting the same well its notbr the material is too thin it wouldnt keep you warm at 60f just thinbr secondly unless you have abnormally long arms the pockets arent comfortable or maybe if you look like a model they arebr thirdly the cut is too low so when i bend im looking like the plummerbr im not fat so its not that im 54 142lbr over all thin product not flattering,0
the jeans are really good quality and they fit comfortably around my waist they do seem a bit long in the leg i always order a 30 in the leg and ive never had a problem i am also kind of disappointed that these are not true skinny jeans and are more of a tapered jean,1
this is probably the 2nd cutest jacket i have ever owned i love it it is nice and warm and the small fits me perfectly i am 127 lbs and 5734 measurements are 34 28 33 my only complaint is that the little hand pieces are too small where my thumb goes through it pulls on the inside between my thumb and finger its extremely uncomfortable its really disappointing since i love thumb holes lol but if i take my thumbs out it still looks cute and keeps my wrists protected from the cold so i still love it and its not worth going up a sizebr br and for what its worth my first cutest jacket i have ever owned was a leather jacket that cost much more than this this jacket is amazing for the price,2
these jammies are very soft and stretchy but shrink and appear misshapen and unattractive after wash,0
i often dont review an item when i feel its just ok and i dont have anything to say that hasnt already been said then i received an email including this phrase 34if everything is satisfied could you please kindly take a few minutes to offer us a feedback and reviewbr we just want you know your review and feedback will be very very important for us34 the grammarian in me is cringing and other than that i do have something to addbr br if youve ever owned any other yogaexercise toe socks you might assume these are the same i bought these for a great price on a lightning deal so im not angry and returning them however i would not recommend wearing these to yoga class it would be far too easy to slip inside the sock resulting in an injury there isnt enough stretch to the material and the extra fabric on the front of the ankle is awkward with the exception of freezing temperatures its healthier to wear toe separating socks so my review is to go ahead and buy them for wearing socks at home during the winter but avoid them if you plan on using them for exercise,1
lol by far the worst thing ive bought on amazon the crappiest polyester material with a pixelated print on it and it was missing the straps in the back do not buy from this retailer,0
very disappointed by the pearl size which is not 12mm but just around 910mm i have real and imitation pearl studs of different sizes so i can tell i am thinking about returning them,0
im beyond annoyed that these flip flops lasted 2 months such a waste of money,0
washed it right after receiving fabric on the sleeve unravelled,0
this shirt is super soft and very pretty my main issue with it is the uneven hemline the sides hit above my waist and the shirt has a very square style im only 52 and it was too short i ended up returning it because it looks ridiculous,0
one of my favorite dresses i love this dress so much i went back and bought a different style from the same company,2
fits great and looks great,2
these run small i ordered 2 sizes up and the sleeves and pants are both still short the print is awesome but only the dinosaur skull glows the skeletons on arms of the shirt and the pants do not,1
quality mediumrange good for the price would buy again,1
very comfortable these have a nice space so my eye lashes never touch the mask just bought my second set,2
size is bigger than expected,0
i am so disappointed cheap material thrown together wrong size not identical to photo the belt is skinny im upset i ordered this fir family and friends day on sunday it arrived on time just not satisfied im sad its still in the plastic returning immediately i ordered 3x look and fits like a large,0
would love a better fit they hurt my toes while a jog,1
i received the real love 3pack of girls ts today the two white tshirts have black and blue ink stains all over them i have ordered a replacement pack and hope the new pack will be without stainsbr br as far as shirt quality i am very pleased with the material and thickness of these tshirts it is hard to find good quality material for childrens plain tshirtsbr br i would also agree with other reviewers who said these tshirts run small i ordered one size up for my slender 11 year old she normally wears a 1012 in tshirts i ordered the 1416 in these and they fit her wellbr br my advice is to have quality control better check these tshirts for flaws more effectively,0
you cannot grab an actual thorn on a rose branch like your photo indicates it does penetrate through the glove i feel the price is too much because of that,0
it arrived today but doesnt even have anything but the bra no straps no clear straps or extension just the bra since ive ordered the same bra in other colors im waiting to see if they have the same missing items in the package and if so ill return them a lo together but this one is going back,0
so sleek and looks elegant my best leather belt in fact i throw away all of my other expensive belts and wear it every day,2
i love nike and these shoes look so good and neat on your feet people ask me who makes them because the swoosh is kinda hard to see but when i respond nike theyre not surprised,2
i really loved my leather skechers wedge shoes and wore them all day until they wore out so i was a little disappointed in these they arent as comfortable dont fit as well and dont breath i wish the company would bring back the ones i loved,1
good deal for the price they are cute and comfy the calf is wide enough for a pair of jeans to tuck in the boots are obviously cheaply made but for the price i was happy,2
wife loves them comfortable stylish,2
super beautiful earrings but theyre also really easy to bend out of curiosity i slightly bent the back of the earring to see how solid it was and was surprised how easy it was to bend i was able to bend it back into shape but will have to be very careful so that they dont get misshapen,1
i ordered a size large even though i normally wear a medium because i wanted to make sure they fit comfortably but they are incredibly tight through the thigh and loose below the knee i have had this same problem several other times purchasing this brand but my very favorite leggings that fit perfectly came from them so i keep trying at one point i purchased two of the same size and the same style and you could visibly see the difference in size between them i think at this point i will stop trying and move on to a different brand,0
to to awsome luv the bling color and fit,2
very cute but comes off my bags,1
i bought these to wear after an abdominal surgery i expected them to be somewhat big but they are huge i normally wear a size 12 and bought according to their size chart they were so big they were awkward so i dont wear them at all the material is soft and light and they would make a nice house pant for lounging around the house in if they fit better,1
nice,2
it was a great fit im a bit heavy and large chested and normally this means clothes are either too tight or too baggy but this fit really well it was soft it was just the right length for boots and tights it looked great and was a little warm,2
way too small for my 3 12 yr old girl so we cant use them would be cute though but thin so i dont think it would protect much from coronovirus,0
too small bought my size but it was a little too tight in the waist which causes the pockets to stick out looked stupid returned,1
my son usually pees through every night when he wears these pajamas he does not there is something about the way they make them that keeps them from soaking though i love that so much about these pajamas,2
pretty but small will not fit much more than my wallet,1
i have purchased other piel leather product and this item is not up to the quality standard of previous items the straps are of a very poor quality and the design is different from what is displayed i returned this item the size is great,1
this is a really cute skort but longer than i expected i am only 5 foot 2 so i prefer my skirts shorter but this one almost comes to my knees other than that it is very comfortable,2
beautiful love the scarf,2
i needed a replacement watch band for my dark blue swatch watch while this watch strap is the correct fit and replacement the blue is much lighter and brighter than my previous strap and does not match my watch face,1
fits ok,1
these leggings are stunningly pretty im 5934 and the size large fits i normally wear medium but didnt want these too small highly recommend,2
as pictured not too long,2
way too small,0
brought these for my daughters birthday she absolutely loved them,2
nice rich colors even after being laundered but my husband who has a 37 waist said the l are too small,2
since ive bought over 11 bracelets im obvious in love with this bracelet ive shared with 3 different groups of friends and they all loved it cant go wrong,2
i like nothing about this sweater the fit is odd its itchy,1
this is a fashion at its best it hangs great looks fantastic and the price it absolutely affordable,2
reliable easy spirit fit not much cushioning especially considering its a walking shoe for my purpose of going to grocery kind of errands will be ok and ill add an innersole to get the expected cushioning,1
its a bit tight a bit short other than that love these shirts great to work in,1
its a cute ring its true to size however less then a month i have a silver ring the gold had completely come off,1
all in all i suppose you get what you pay for here just dont order it expecting too much the look and feel of the item are illustrated here by its price fury suit items are pricey especially the good ones this was bought for a child to play with so considering i suppose its an okay buy,1
this item looks nothing like the picture its extremely tight and clingy i ordered the gray and it was a very light pale gray not a dark gray like the picture shows it also has two seams coming down the front that look really weird very different than the picture and not flowy at all i definitely do not recommend this product returning for a refund,0
the dress arrived however it was apparent that this dress wasnt new and it had a stain im not fond of the material used to make this dress very disappointed,0
theres really no flaws i bought this a little while ago and its still in great condition,2
always fall off,1
love it,2
your sizing chart is way wrong shirt ordered based on your guidelines xlsize shipped to me clearly an xxl that has been relabeled also noticed while shirt collar did say utopia it had been silk screened on over another manufacturers label as you could see faint impressions of the words underneath i do not recommend ps why cant we give 0 stars amazon,0
love the adjustable straps around the ears and the strap around the neck so my kid doesnt lose it,2
was told these were shady rays when i ordered thembr that was a lie they are called raysharpbr boy did i get ripped off,0
fell apart the second day i had it,0
me quedo muy bien y luce mucho además super comoda lo uso casual,2
this is a great little purse i like all the pockets and the size my only criticism is that the zipper sticks frequently,2
pros very lightbr cons no support,0
not as expected caused sore piercing which only happens when i wear cheap jewelry,0
simple cute,2
no están mal para su precio,2
havent worn the dress i think i need to get a bigger size or lose the weight feels and looks fine will not return it,1
neat and comfortable nike shoe cozy and cute to wear all summer,2
i really like these they fit right they do glow as stated it is an excellent buy try it,2
beautiful dress and nice pink color but top part fits funny ane large and it is reallyyyy extremely long,1
i have been looking for a wallet like this all my life well made quality craftsmanship classy smell that beautiful leather you would be a dummy not to buy this one i probably 3 more,2
very cheap chain discolors almost immediately,0
very comfortable and nice qualitytts,2
these water shoes are awesome for kayaking they fit well drain well dry quickly the soles have pretty good traction on them so when im out of the kayak i can walk comfortably on the rocks without cutting up my feet or slipping the fit is spot on and they are comfortable to wear in out of the water they seem pretty well made and my wife thought i bought them at rei when i was out running errands she was really surprised wants a pair now too,2
these are hugh they fall down supposed to be military approved not so at all these are so thin not much material tshirt material quality not gloves these remind me of a pair socks what are they so big in the arms,0
the size appears to run on the small size,1
loved this purchase super cute i was going for something more modest and this was perfect i have a pretty long torso for a short person 5ft 4in and im also a breast feeding mother so my boobs are on the big side and also by butt is big so this was a huge risk for me but its super cute if your going for modesty though my only concern was that there was some serious cleavage going on still cute but i was a little self conscious of that personally overall great material really cute look highly recommend it also was shipped in two days,2
i have been wearing hokas for 7yrs now havent found any other running shoes that match their comfort i thought these were just too cute so i went ahead and got them i wore them to work once im a nurse and im on my feet for 12hrs these will be just for running errands on my days off even with extra cushion support added these are not comfortable for anything but light use,1
useful displaybr be its cardboard dont recall in description,0
fun comfortable socks,2
stretch out really fast,1
i bought this for my wife but it is more masculant and may be better for a man because is not very feminan,1
i ordered 912 month outfit is very large,0
perfectas,2
to small,0
its cute it came with a hole in the pocket right where the seem is i still decided to keep it though because its soft and i can find someone to sew it,2
they are too big for my face so i gave them to a friend she loves them,1
this is so much better than i expected and especially for the price i have purchased costumes from halloween stores before for much more and the quality is much less the fabric is a much higher quality than the costumes i have bought in the past super happy with this purchase,2
very pretty and soft after washing light weight and ideal for summer wearing,2
quality is excellent sizing is all over the place xl on topl under l is clearly bigger fit is equivalent to sm xl equivalent to xss,1
my 10 yr old with slim feet loves the fit size 57 the crocs with the crocband fit my older son wide feet but hurt the slim feet colors are as pictured only downside they dont come in enough patternscolors for the price i would love to get a pattern he actually likes,2
small easy to use and does the job not high security but a good basic security lock,2
tortoise are weird not sure bifocals are lined up right,0
fits fine,2
earpiece broke after wearing a couple of times loved them until then,0
it did the job i needed to repair my leather tennis shoe sole and it worked perfect i used clamps and let them dry overnight im hard on shoes but i work in them every day on a concrete floor and so i try to get the most wear possible out of a pair before buying new i havent washed the shoes yet though so not sure how it will hold up once washed,2
i purchased this for my granddaughter she wears a size 1011 and is about 5 3 is fits her well with a little room to get taller it flatters her we are both happy with the purchase,2
i bought this for my daughter to use for school as she doesnt like to carry a regular backpack the fabric is thick and seems to be of good quality however one side came not attached but was an easy fix to tie it on like the other side after using this bag only 5 times one of the loops came completely unattached making it unusable im going to try to fix this issue as my daughter needs it for school maybe i received a defective bag seeing as it came the way it did,1
normal retail suggested price for a chinese made kn95 is less than a us dollar,0
not flannel at all all od these are thin with flannel print not flannel matrial,1
i have to saya little dissapointed with this outfit jacket wasnt finished well and the pants are very small and tight,0
rough material,0
after about 5 minutes i wanted them off this was my first time trying shirt stays but the material kept rubbing against my leg hairs and it got really itchy and uncomfortable really fast,0
the camping tent bead looks exactly as pictured it fits on my pandora bracelet before i ordered this i was concerned that the 34camping34 would be too fragile i ordered it any way im glad i did the entire bead seems very sturdy and well made it has the 925 stamp on the bottom its a cute reminder of our camping trip,2
i liked the style of the dressnot thrilled about the fabricbut the size i ordered the xlusually not problem this xl is very very small regretfully i am returning,0
they seem flimsy and dont stand up well when placed on the floor not what i was expecting and they were bought to use for gifts,0
these are gorgeous the fit and material is excellent,2
do not buy this shirt the package arrived in the usual zipper bag as does most clothing but i noticed the bag looked cloudy or dirty but then i unzipped the bag and grabbed the shirt out and it had black dust all over the shirt and inside of the bag and it got all over my hands i attempted to wash it and added stain remover to try and salvage it and the first picture was the result the dye used to create the color block above and below the stripes was completely disintegrating off the shirt and disappeared entirely when i tried to wash it to the point where the color above and below the stripes was gone and it became see through never have i seen this in something i ordered off amazon dont waste your money,0
it gets tangled,0
they look good but one of the latches was broke on the pair i received so i couldnt even ware them,0
these were not made well they are really cute but they zipper area was not sewn correctly and it rubbed terrible i had to return them,0
i bought these boots for my husband and 2 boys for hunting they love them they arebr very comfortable warm waterproof and very durable i would recommendbr these boots not to mention the screaming deal i got on amazoncom,2
this costume fit my 6 year old daughter perfect truly authentic looking very pleased with this purchase,2
love this suit so simple and comfortable beautiful color and fit,2
these are great shoes for the price a similar shoe with similar quality aka mostly leather would normally cost at least 100 they are comparably comfortable though i recommend to size half a size up would always do that with pointy toe high heels at least if you are on the wider side with your feettoe box definitely recommend havent really worn them yet so will update once thats happened,2
nice boot well made but not for someone with high arches,1
super comfortable to wear and fits great,2
the shirt was a little smaller than i thought it was going to be still fit great design,2
the bra was beautiful but unfortunately it was too small and did not fit,1
leather is too thick and remains stiff after a couple months of wear very disappointed,1
fabric was too thin for what i need want an undergarment that is comfortable supportive and not too thin didnt like the way it lookedkind of flimsy,0
tends to run a little small in some places a little large in other coat is fairly warm i did not pay full price so for the discount it was a good buy paying full price would not have been a bargin,1
it us a wonderful hand bag my wife uses it everyday its also a very good priced article i recommend it greatly,2
its way too big despite following guidelines for size theres no way to adjust anything but it quality material,1
the blue is more of a mixed blue with white,1
do not have tummy control just a wrinkled up mess,0
not real opals,0
the light grey was a tighter fit than the black,2
i am usually a medium occasionally large depending on style so i ordered a small it is a tighter fit than other shirts but fits just fine the fabric is silkier it is really cute on the model but not one of my favorite shirts maybe because of the fabric,1
the dress looked like the picture and for the most part i did not see any damages but it was too big and the waistline of the dress fell way too low i naturally have a big bust line 36g and there was space for probably 23 more inches and the shoulders were loose the material is stretchy so that doesnt help to give the dress structure eitherdue to it being to big the waistline to low and not having much structure even with a petticoat added i had to return it if you do get this dress size down one and if you have a short waistline or even average like myself it will hit you at your hipbone instead of your natural waist and get a very fluffy petticoat,1
very cheaply made noisy fabric barely any insulation and what was there was lumpy i bought two both were made the same theyre not even worth the 27 black friday price,0
nice shirt way too small gave it to my dil who wears a womens small,0
there a lil color difference in left and right,1
loves them,2
my gap size in true skinnies is a 29 i wear size 4 in most others these were tight i probably should have sent them back for a 30 they fit like a legging super tight lots of stretch but i wouldnt wear them instead of a regular jean they are too form fitting,1
not very strong cracked at the base,0
just loved the tulip pendant necklaceit hung just the perfect length long enough to be seen but not in the way eitherthe price was very reasonable and the necklace was made very wellcouldnt wait to wear it so i could show it offmade a great addition to my jewelry box,2
this is a review for the 3 pairs of hissox dark grey crew socks in size medium im specifying since there are a few sock options under the product listingbr br according to the description size medium should fit womens 9115 mens 8105 i wear a mens 75 the medium socks fit without being too big so i would say these socks run smallbr br after the first wash the socks shrunk about half an inch on the leg but this didnt affect the fit of the sock on my foot i didnt notice a difference between the washed smaller sock and an unwashed sockbr br the socks have some nice cushioning in the heel and toe they are comfortable to wearbr br but im concerned about the longevity of the socks one of the pairs had snagged threads right out of the bag,1
skelton figure faded chipped after 2 washes,0
shorts arent loose fitting and arent as long as the picture,1
perfect bra great padding comfortable great shape,2
im super upset that the stitching was done horribly i cant believe they sent it that way as if they didnt notice,0
pay attention to the reading i thought i did until i went back a re read after ordering you will only get 1 plug not 1 pair just 1 for one ear so you have to make sure your ordering two other than that issue they are cute i do wear them even though it says for stretching,1
these masks are pretty but even when adjusting the ear straps as tight as possible scrunching your ears in the process there are gaps around the nose they seem far too thin to be very effective,0
smaller than expected and the seams didnt line up cleanly,1
i first bought the love pop card with the same pose as the earrings after i saw the earrings i hasd to get them to complete the gift my wife is very happy,2
it took 2 sheets on a lint roller to get all the feathers off lol but it is very comfortable the string on the pants is a bit short but thats an easy fix there is stretch to the waistline but the ankles are so tight i almost want to cut them open i am also tall 510 so when i bend or sit the ankle rides up but since its so tight it stops early and makes the pants end up sliding down my waist a bit overall im happy bc theyre very warm and fine for around the house or going out in the cold for a short time,2
leather cheap looking crocs super ugly returned within minutes of trying them on,0
we put our winnings in it also bank card,2
the shorts are nice they just run about a size to small,1
brown elbow cutouts look awkward as the material is very cheap and fuzzy not fake leather like i thought,1
just didnt like the elastic band,0
enormous bought the small it is about a size 12 and length is cut for a 6tall person missed the timeframe to return so im now stuck with it and dont know any 6 tall women that might want this,0
oh my god nice very comfortable we will need very soft,2
love the design a little small thou,2
the material of this dress is pretty cheap and when stretched over my top portion it has a white glow to it otherwise it was a cute dress,0
served its purpose for halloween but the headband broke on the 3rd day of use the foam on it is also very cheap looking and came with creases and other imperfections,1
i love this bag i cannot wait to give it to my future daughter in law,2
these are very cute but sizing is way off i am a size 9 wide i got an 8 because of the other reviews they were still huge on me im returning them because i really dont know that a 7 would even work they are extremely wide as well,1
not worth it,0
button came off of pants soon as he put them ondo better,1
i can literally see through this fabric also we purchased an xl for someone that wears a large and it way too small the xl fits a small the decal is also very thick,0
xmas for daughter very nice,1
these sunglasses does alleviate somewhat all the glare in the bright sun the colors are bright and crisp i do believe thebr description said that the legs were adjustable there were no instructions as to adjusting the legs on the glasses thisbr was significant to me because the right leg on the glasses is uncomfortable and is hurting my ear i cannot adjust the legbr because i cannot figure out a way to do so at this point the glasses are not comfortable however the lens and the visionbr of the glasses are superbbr br they are worth buying because of the quality and style if they become more comfortable i would give 10 stars they arebr reasonably priced because of the quality and clear crisp vision,2
it fits really well and is very comfortable i underestimated my ability to wear a v neck swimsuit but no matter the top is easy to tie behind the neck and doesnt pull,2
the cut of this shirt is odd top is big and waist is snug i wear a 36b and wear 29 waist size 79,0
the pin itself is gorgeous it is sturdy and will last the pin clasp bent then snapped off when i tried to pin it but i loved it so much i super glued a better clasp win win,1
returned due to being too wide and uncomfortable,1
i wanted a pair of aviators to wear these arrived fast but boy are they big if you like really big glasses these are for you not the original kind i was looking for,0
looks good but hard to read dial,1
not a fan of this hat i dont think i have a big head but this hat is too shallow and fits really weird i wont be wearing this one,0
the fit is ridiculously small it is more than one full size too small from end to end also too narrow,0
the platform was uncomfortable did not been enough,0
jesus is the reason for every season absolutely loved this cap i was durable beautiful packaging and i will keep it forever got so many compliments easy to assemble as well,2
my daughter had bought these quite sometime ago and they have been through alot of water and just very rough activities and they did not even start to fade or even start turning green i would recommend because the multiple styles can go with different outfits the only flaw is its only size fits all also it is absolutely worth the price,2
poorly built not very comfortable,0
very thin material and super stiff,0
i ordered this nightgown because i only had short sleeve ones it is very soft and fits perfectly i ordered a medium the gown is very soft and comfy,2
too small for it to be size 10 there something that constantly digs into heel and ankle returning asap and buckles are gold certainly not military boot or combat boot style,0
pretty statement necklace but gets tangled easily if id known how much id be playing with it to untangle i would not have bought it,1
really like the fabric of this i think ill wash it by hand you have to be careful with it i tried to clean a sauce spot i made and some of strigs came out a little but nothing to worry about if you wash it carefully it fits well if you are skinny and you choose xs,2
a again i like these sandals but they were too narrow for my feet i hope to return them for a credit thank you,0
i love wearing maxi dresses and skirts but the one thing i could not get over was how the seams never matched up with any of the designs it is kind of cheaply made for the top part of the material and shows the edges of my bra too much i am 585 133 lbs and ordered a medium some of the dresses go to my feet and some were around the ankle bone the length of these dresses are very inconsistent,0
bought for my grandmother she likes them very much very soft and comfortable,2
this item fell apart i washed it once and what can i say its ruined,0
it was smaller than expected if youre looking for an oversized cardigan like its shown on the model than youll want to size up,1
this is absolutely stunning even without lights super soft well made comfortable everybody loved it perfect for wearing any time,2
2stars because it said butt lifting done of these legging do that i bought it because the texture is different also the waist seems like its 4quot elastic but its not inside it has a 1quot elastic band which its made cheap but 5 stars on the materialjust because its different bought a medium the scrunch butt isnt that noticeable so it doesnt enhance your butt that much,0
these arent quite big enough for santa to wear comfortably over his ears the eye part is fine but the length of the ear pieces could be longer,1
i must say that this dress is very pretty however the top portion of the dress is scratchy and it doesnt really fall properly esp on the shoulder with the bunched up cloth it is also rather long my girl is 7 and of average height this dress falls to an awkward length at her mid calf,0
pros elastic waist belt loop buttonzipper lightweight well madebr br cons runs small order one size up if youre in the plus size range,1
hav not used yet missing pieces 1 tap to secure laces was missing cant put in laces without it but looks good im sure once i get the piece from the seller all will be fine,1
wish it had a vneck its not nice looking or flattering to wear,0
i was very excited to receive this product but i was very disappointed to find that they fit extremely small i understand they are compression pants and are supposed to fit snug i followed the size chart provided by amazon and even ordered a size larger than recommended to make sure they would fit comfortably i am a size 3234 waist and i ordered a large the size chart recommended a medium for a size 3334 so i thought i would be safe going bigger i struggled to get them over my waist the legs were also very short i am 6 and the pants only went down to my calf i double checked the tag and they are marked a large but there is no way a 3734 waist would fit in them overall the quality does seem to be be very good i am just disappointed that i will not be able to wear them disclosure i have received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review the product was received for inspection and evaluation purposes after careful testing and thorough examination of this product i am providing this review no monitory compensation was received and i was not required to write a positivenegative review,0
light and elegant,2
after three orders i simply gave up i am 5feet 7 inches 170 lbs i started with size xl too small went to2xl still too small went to 3xl and it is too large i am a seamtress so i might consider alterations but for this price i dont want to have to do that kind of work its not that important to my wardrobe this dress is truly not fitting as expected the short sleeve dress is black with blue top which makes it look cheap i have had some luck with other dresses by this brand but this was pretty bad,0
we ordered a size 14 for our girl who wears size 12 it was too small we returned and got a size 16 and it still looks as though she is stuffed in it we got a size 12 from another vendor and it worked fine so be aware of sizing aside from that the material is all right feels soft shed have enjoyed it i think if it had fit her we did not return she removed the tags before i could get to it,1
definitely not 855 way too small,0
nice,1
nice looking but cheap clasp has fallen off numerous times and this time i lost it,0
kinda wide,1
broke immediately dont buy,0
i ordered this product as a gift and was very happy with the color and the tint of the lens,2
the straps broke on all four of them shitty quality do not buy,0
this is about my third or fourth pair of these swimwear trunks i seem to lose one pair each year at the gym where i swim they are reasonably well made on the outside i havent had the stitching come undone or the material rip or tear but the inside is where the problems develop they have a kind of checkered white fabric inside that kind of keeps certain parts from dangling and that fabric will break down especially if you wear the swimwear in chlorinated water like public pools in california that said the trunks dry very quickly are comfortable to wear fairly soft and fit well by size if you dont want a synthetic material like it bothers your skin or something you dont want this swimwear,2
received shoes today love the style usually always get cheap shoes but realized for myself that i need better and more expensive ones always have issues finding good shoes that will last a while and not kill my feet cause i am always walking first time trying out under armour shoes they fit me perfectly fit comfortably so far so good hoping after few hours walking my feet wont ache i know some have complained about size runs small but i dont seem to have that issue wear 6 12 and they fit perfectly on me that size maybe some have issues with the width of their feet hoping they will last me at least a yearbr br update very upset loved the shoes but only had them for 2 months and has hole in them i dont know how the hole came about but more i wear them the hole gets bigger that was actually one of my worries when getting these if a hole somehow would happen in the material now they are comfortable otherwise best shoes ive ever had that way but did not last i wear them about every day so i warn you if want them to last i would have another extra pair of shoes to trade off with,0
fit true to size my son loved it stitching was good quality as is the material only downside is my child broke out in a rash on his back from this jersey can only wear it with a shirt underneath,2
not what i expected also i felt they didnt represent the product accurately as you view the heart no where does it show that the back side of the heart is black from the front as advertised its a beautiful pink but when you turn it over it black,0
the waist stash itself is nice i will use it but it does not do rfid protection tested it i put my work entry card into the waist stash and it read the card i then lined the stash with aluminum foil and it wasnt able to read it so solution for me is i will line it with foil it is comfortable and i do think it is necessary for my travel fits my credit cards passport and money easily and slips into the top of my pants i also purchased the neck stash but i dont think i like that one i can at least access the waist one if im sitting at a table,1
not as nice gavin as my older pairs of the same ones plus they do not have the movement of my other pairs i think this is due to the tighter fit or higher inseam,1
item was made too small for an average woman,0
had to change the rating it was a gift unfortunately the string is fraying between the beads and my son is afraid it will break now hes worn it for only 5 months,1
i bought a 40g i checked all my current bras are 40g did not fit at all had to return,0
the shirt itself is okay sizing was correctbut the design isnt centered on it so unless youre wearing something over it it looks off,1
great product would buy again,2
overall i like these pants the black ones are pretty see through when you bend over they dont fit snug on my body so that is not the problem i will not be wearing these on leg day the granite color ones are perfect and you cannot see through those i probably will not purchase this brand again because the pants are too big on me i am a size 810 and ordered a m as suggested by the size chart they are long for taller women i am 5834 and there is still room in the ankle,1
shirts are thinner than what you would expect sleeves are short sleeves and shirt bottom also curl,1
very nice shirt material good quality good got lots of compliments,2
product kind of cheaply made and not true to size,1
i am really satisfied with the tshirt i like the brand they like the way it washes up and dont shrink i love the logo on the top on the front of the shirt i have a dog who is appropriate i think,2
my husband is very hard on his clothes so were always on the lookout for items that look good are good quality and are comfortable these shorts look and fit great and he likes them so much he puts them right back on as soon as they come out of the laundry and even more importantly they are made of sturdy material and he hasnt managed to rip them yet all around win in my book,2
fit well economical good choice,2
fit to size very light great design and color wanted,2
the owl was 3 times the size it appears in the photo,0
perfect band easy to install,2
i bought this to replace one that i thought was just like it this one is just okthe front pockets on my old baggalini bag were deep enough to comfortably hold my water bottlethe pockets in this one are not quite deep enough and the bottle easily falls out in the car etc also in my old bag the middle pocket in the front had a little 34sleeve pocket34 that was perfect for carrying business card this bag doesnt have that lastly the big pocket in the back is great but my old bag was made with to zippers so that i could slip it over the handle of my luggage when i travel there are fewer interior pockets as well i kept it i love how durable baggalini bags are and they are generally pretty smart looking,1
i love an assortment of pjs this one is comfortable soft not clingy cool and yet color is rich as shown on picture,2
i mean i wont spend money on these again i could have taken the crotch out of a new pair of panties and added ear loops the dollar tree brand and made these but i guess they will do lets just hope they hold,1
minimum tummy flatten i hardly notice any difference at all i used to find girdle type panties that dont go up to your breasts too too high for comfort,1
cheap materials very disappointed,0
these boots are ok at best for a small frame or light guy these could be the best thing on earth im six one two fifty and these boots couldnt hold up the foot cut is more nike style and my heel is just to much for that converse had a sweet zip up boot and i have had four pairs since there start but no more and i guess the quest shall continue for its replacement,1
smells very manly probably wont repurchase,1
i ordered larger than normal listening to the advice of other reviewers and its perfect love it,2
it is a comfortable material but kind of tight around the face,2
i ordered a 2xl that was all they had they sent me 5xl and it was the size of an extra large the suit itself was of good material and if it would have been the right size i probably would have kept it but seeing how i needed it for this week not gonna happen they were good about returning the package though,0
i got this for christmas it is the perfect size to hold all my gym stuff ive used it three weeks twelve times andtoday i noticed a big hole in the bag a seam split the full length where the material pulled away fron the stitching a sign of sewing rhe seam too close to the edge of the material i had to get my sewing machine and fix and reinforce this seam as well as the seam on the other side also noticed the black nylonpolyester material on the side is showing signs of degregating so i had to reinforce rhe material with duck tapebr nice size no interior pockets one outside pocket no brand name made in china i willconsider myself lucky if this lasts until summer poor quality will not buy unknown brand again,0
its a tight fit but i really liked it the ear pieces arent attached so youll need superglue otherwise you might lose them during use,2
crappy cheap fell apart,0
cute dress but some of the stitching was poor and it had a stain on it,1
a little long but nice product,2
a little big print was a little messed up and i feel like its overpriced will be returning,0
love this blouse its very nice and fits well i always get compliments when i wear it,2
this is a cute dressjust not quite the same as in person ill add leggings probably a sweater to dress it up a bit the material is a bit thin would probably make a cute bathing suit cover up,1
one broke the first time i used it,0
i returned them didnt fit well too small,1
all hype,0
looks a little cheap but should be good for an inexpensive gift,2
the product is flimsy it doesnt trap all the hear while shaving and hence done not serve the purpose i would recommend looking elsewhere,0
sizes are for babies i think,0
love these bow ties had a black tie dinner to attend so grabbed this bad boy and paired with my black suit and was looking fly,2
awful these leggings are not stretchy i wear size xs but bought sizes s and m for my daughters they could not put them on but even if they could leggings would be too short size s barely fit me i am 52 102 lb but i still cant move in them because theyre not stretchy at all size m fit better around hips but too baggy at the bottom i wish i could return,0
el color es mas oscuro que el de la foto,1
these look really upscale,2
this watch is attractive and i previously gave it a good review but after wearing it twice i find that the clasp does not stay hooked it just falls of the wrist i will be returning this,0
i have a narrow foot and have had dozens of naturalizer shoes in my closet during the years first of all let me say that i love the color of the shoe and thought because it had velcro on the strap i could adjust the fit perfectly if i adjust the strap so that it is comfortable and a perfect fit the velcro goes past where it should attach and down the side of the shoe i will take it to a shoe shop to see if i can get it fixed or for now wear a thicker sock which is not my preference i have noticed that since naturalizer started having their shoes made in china that the fit is not the same still a nice shoe,1
husband is a huge dr who fan absolutely loves this robe fits him well its nice thick material and very soft color is bright blue and accurate to the photo good quality made with nice embroidery would recommend to other dr who fans,2
look very nice but not well made one of the beads fell off after wearing them after just once,1
very comfortable,2
this is a nice piece but it fell apart on me,0
these are super comfortable and soft to wear the compression liner is a bit loose so size upbr br the phone holder is useless depending on your phone iphone 13 just jangles around and smaller phones might work better,1
harder to breathe through this mask,1
out of all five only three stayed working two only lasted a few minutes before they stopped ticking,0
i am normally a small but ordered a medium and its still snug its way shorter than i would like for a dress but would maybe work as a cover up or with leggings for the price i will probably keep it,1
these socks do not look like socks at all they look like jankity mittens with no thumb whole do not buy them they remind me of hospital socks the ones with the grippers on them without the coziness sure you can tell where the sides are but there is not a defined 34spot34 for your heel,0
this is not off one shoulder as pictured it is a regular tshirt after reading reviews about the sizing i decided to buy a large well i should have stuck to my size this is way too big for me,0
looks like the price,1
i dropped it down a flight of stairs after just my first day i was thoroughly impressed when it bounced 3 times and hit the floor without it breaking opening and it only has two tiny scuff marks it felt flimsy when i took it out of its box but it completely proved me wrong fit my big lens sunglasses no problem and its really pretty a bit bulky but its worth it for the protection it evidently provides,2
it was a gift for my mom she loved it so much i sent her the earrings to match,2
fit perfect and very comfortable the velcro fell off the first time i wore them,0
todo me agrado el material buenisimo,2
the shirts were cute but to small in the breast section,1
one day i will stop believing that a bra billed as plus size in a dd cup will ever hold support you like the picture shows im keeping this bc the back is cute enough so it will be a fancy 34house bra34 i guess total uniboob up front and sagging bc of lack of support aka nothing to support you at all just cotton,1
love them,2
these arent good or bad they just are i mean theyre a little soft and easily bent so if youre hard on your jewelry like me i wouldnt recommend,1
too short for long torsos scratchy fabric weird sleeves,0
nice durable shirt,2
fits smaller than normal its actually stretchy not a tshirt like i expected,1
horrible fit size look material just ugly,0
id give it 5 stars if its locking latch didnt break on its 3rd flight where it would still latch thankfully since i need it for the return trip but just wont lock delsey did repair the latch but with a different colored one from the original greyneutral color now my bag really stands out which im fine with i would have asked delsey to redo the repairs and put on the original grey latch but it took 3 months for the original repair and i just dont want that hassle again since then this bag has been on many more flights and has held up well size is perfect for almost all situations,2
ordered these for medical reasons and they are better suited for sports,0
in theory these should be great shoes in practice one of the shoes makes noise when walking the other one does not weird,0
they are described as thin but they are a lot more thin than i was expecting you can almost see through them when they are stretched out they fit perfectly though and are a good fit for no show socks,1
i love the watch band,2
i loved the earring cuffi thought it was a little bit smaller than showni still wear it i love it,2
ugly shirt very wide,0
cheap looking,0
ive worn this bowtie about 10 times and multiple threads from the white dots are coming loose its almost unwearable nowbr br also the sizing is way off from every other bowtie i own i usually wear a 16 and on this its an 18,0
this clip broke on my second use,0
purchase this for my purse great for organization and lots of compartments but it is too heavy,0
ordered a large to be sure it fit it barely fits my size 4 daughter,0
a replacement for one that i carried every day for years and years the original one held up to years of use and this one will too im sure,2
while these earrings exactly meet the product description the actual product isnt what i wantedneeded the straight piece the part that goes through your ear is thicker than expected and doesnt go through mine wo pain and considerable effortbr br please note that if your holes are somewhat stretched then there shouldnt be a problem if yours are like mine and fairly close to the original piercing size you may have troublebr br overall these were a good value for the spent they just werent right for me,1
the costume was very large even after using the size charti had to have it taken in to even look good,1
these reading glasses are of excellent quality and the cute style is so modern it was worth the price charged as the saying goes 34you get what you pay for34 the color and shape is very attractive for my medium sized face,2
was hoping the facecase was a little larger its okay for the price not worth anymore though it would be worth more with a date function,1
wen u put them on they feel uneven n they slip off but they are soft,0
the material is somewhat rigid making it a bit of an awkward fit doesnt like to stay put in the retaining bands,1
works perfect,2
i did not like the material dress was too thin and not flattering at all,1
right foot was a whole size bigger,0
love this outfit however faded pretty bad on first wash my son still gets lots of complements while wearing it,2
run a little small compared to the other xxl shirts i own too short for the price these should be exactly the right size puma seems to sell asian size clothing and shoes these days,1
i was not happy with this piece i bought to give as a gift but they looked too cheaplike something that couldve come from the dollar store to be worn for a halloween costumeseriously,0
the sleeves are too small for the size of the jacket love the color and style i have it to my mother it fit her better than me,1
great shoe for my needs,2
shoes are just too hard to order online,1
muy mala calidad,0
i bought these as a gift for my cousin and they are absolutely beautiful they are heavy and have a very good quality for the price and to get all of the house sigils and the quality of the keychains this is an amazing deal,2
good it works my kid likes it,1
right out of the box one shoe doesnt turn on at all even after charging overnight nothing at all customer service yea they dont exist at all they dont respond back to issues or complaints at all complete waste of money,0
pretty but flimsy,1
very large i ended up wearing it as an around the house moomoo,0
love this swimsuit it is exactly as described and fits me very well,2
not really my girls style belt is nice and made well but non of my girls liked the style or the print it looked a little too fake also the buckle seemed a bit on the cheap side probably meant more as a fashion statement than an actually belt took forever to arrive but i think it was lost in the mail somewhere so not sellers fault,1
this fi me just as i expected it was thin material but went perfect with my santa costume it was comfortable and did not itch,2
its just ok for me because it feels narrow,1
after reading reviews i did order up 1 size and the fit is perfect they are not sheer at all and there is just enough fleece lining to help keep warm so glad i ordered,2
very small very small,0
got a different dress than what i ordered the photos show the straps as ruched chiffon that is slightly off the shoulder what i got were lace tanktop straps with a keyhole back completely different also this dress is different at the waist than the one in the photo it does a mock wrap instead of having the ribbonbr do not buy from this seller this dress is not the same as the one being advertised,0
very cheap looking,0
the product is terrible quality the material is car too thin and is already falling apart it smelled foul when it came in very dissatisfied,0
too small returning,0
they do appear as they are in the pictures but you can buy these from hot topic for cheaper the only thing different about the ones at hot topic is that the 34bitch34 tag is round like the 34jerk34 tag is,1
a wonderful time piece which keeps accurate time attractive and the light feature is awesome,2
great for business travelers wish i could buy it in other colors as well,2
this shirt is like a plastic bag only thinner the graphics are like they painted them on very very cheaply,0
i really love this except i wish it was longer and had more options for spaces that hold earrings the top left side for studs and hanging earrings doesnt hold any of them well you cannot get your backings on and off of them and the necklace spaces are all really for only very short necklaces i love the quality the locking device and the led lighting very easy to put on the hooks for the over the door option,1
great fit great deal,2
came in damaged and in piecesbr very poor quality,0
aun no no he recibido reembolso en mi tarjeta del valor de la devolucion de este bra,0
overall my husband liked it but it tarnishes a bit not too much you just cant get it wet at all,1
bottoms have no support for the buttocks,1
these are definitely gramma shoes the right one is higher than the left one the toe is rounded and is not sculpted as it looks in pic they are like walking on styrofoam the quality is as if they were made in a remote village somewhere on the yangtze dont buy these over priced by all but one dollar,0
i really liked this dress and wore it for my birthday i think it is very flattering but if you are at all self conscious about your stomach area then i wouldnt recommend also i have no chest to speak of and it was still flattering to my shape the material itself was higher quality than expected,2
got these tee shirts for my husband as a gift great quality washes well he enjoys wearing them especially with the pocket for his pens,2
too small size is wrong,0
super uncomfortable on the nose and the overall mask is awkwardly big on the face,0
just what i wanted and even the style ive been looking for months its been around a month and nothing flaked off came with a case holder polishing hanky and a screwdriver why buy ray bans when you get more for a tenth of the price,2
the sneaker was a bit large for me and it looked a little cheap,1
so happy with my purchase quick delivery the medallions are as pretty as the picture,2
description said runs true to size it was huge and fabric was very heavy,1
cut small,1
this hat was as advertisedgood quality knit and the color was color matching the picture i really wanted to like the hat but sent it back because the crown was so out of proportion high the hat is not pictured as a floppy hat nor is it made that way but it just looks silly standing up so high,1
this is awesome pair of glasses fits my round face perfectly it the right shade not too dark at all structure is well made i will be rocking these chic glasses for the summer at the beach,2
recieved a navy blue small small scarf guess i did not look at the size closely enough,0
i really like it and have gotten a lot of compliments,2
my husband says these are very comfortable,2
i have a 7 34 inch head and hatsize and have two other xl helmets that fit perfectly but this core helmet in xl did not fit at all much too tight and wouldnt rest properly on the top of my head however the quality of this helmet appears to be excellent and the paint is flawless,1
this product is made very cheap the american flag emblem is not actually on the hat and the elastic in the pony tail is horrible it serves it purpose overall,0
i am a senior citizen who is currently experiencing restricted movement this is a godsend on days when i am stiff and sore i can put my shoes on with ease,0
i had to return it because it did look as pictured in person,0
these are the size of an american large and not a 2xl,1
a nice top but not for small boobs im 32b it was a little big,2
a swimsuit top will hold your breast better than this this piece is made from a not so stretchy elastic band and lace thats it the product seems poorly constructed but you get what you pay for i am only giving it to stars because it looks cute around the house,0
bought to use at beach was able to carry most everything family needed at beach used to transport food for camping too great tote and holds alot with out holding sand salt water or rain,2
what i wanted but much too large,1
i was very disappointed first it smelled awful like mildew when i put it on with the dress l bought it to wear with it looked cheap thumbs down ill never use it,0
this was disappointing i wear a largeextra large but ordered a xxl to make sure it fit it was very snug and fit more like a mediumlarge there was no way i could zip it up it seems good quality and well made its soft and id say rival bigger names brands but the sizing is way off youll definitely want to order several sizes larger,1
super cute goes with nearly everything and i get loads of compliments on itbr br update bought in march one of the strings has already broken beginning of july i havent worn it much thanks to quarantine and i never allow it to get wet pretty disappointed since this is one of my favorites and i was excited to wear it out more,1
these shirts are perfect the are about hip length and arent to tight my only reason for a 3 star review is after 1 wash one of the tops have a whole already,1
i absolutely love this dress i got the navy in a large 36dd usually wear a 1012 i loved it so much that my friend ended up ordering it after she saw it great deal for the price ill probably end up buying it in another color because i like it that much,2
i loved them but they did not stay latched i had to send them back,0
my 7 year old loves these shoes she would wear them to church on sunday if well like we ever went they are super cute dry fast fit snugly and are great for the water park especially on sundays,2
the fur is a bit matted and not quite as fluffy as i hoped the horns droop down instead of sticking straight up and the 34angry ed34 eyes look more like sleepy ed instead of angry totally fine for my purposes these things arent deal breakers but just little details that i noticed,1
i love this tshirt but it runs small and seems to have spandex in it instead of being 100 cotton to me spandex can make clothing feel tight and this is definitely smaller than the size chart would lead you to believe it has that stretch that bounces back to its original small size,1
i am 5ft tall 110lbs 34d it fits me enough except on my chest area given not most asians are big chested girls it was tight on the chest area i have to use 3 safety pins on the opening to make sure it wont pop out open the neck area button is tight as well so i just i leave it open and it doesnt look bad at all after all i had lots of compliments wearing this on chinese new year at my work also i had a problem with shipping they returned it without me returning it before it arrives it was resolved but it the item takes awhile to arrive,1
its alright stays up well but the print quality is meh and it feels more polyester than i was hoping,1
you definitely need the curves to pull this one off curves in which i didnt have it fits my sister perfectly,2
flawless transaction and product,2
size is accurate material is so great for hot weather and they feel pretty soft against your skin great for outdoor and water sports i bought them for kayaking,2
i bought it for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loved it,2
the product was inexpensive for a reason worked well for a few days but the cooling gel whatever is inside the pouch seeped out throught the material over time after one week of use it was simply a cloth headband an identical item i purchased in jamaica lasted much longer,0
these lenses are a waste of money they did not fit in the glasses that they were made to fit,0
this ring looks cheap which i guess it is i was underwhelmed so i returned the ring also my engagement ring is a cathedral set and the ring didnt match up well with it save your money up and invest in a nice wedding band,0
white dress is see through the top of the dress is cut weird doesnt fit right will be returning,0
fit isnt very flattering returned it,0
the way the ad was listed it showed 2 at one time and the listing stated classic bar and shield which led me to believe it was 2 when it was only 1,1
not bad better for winter riding in texas,1
great bra but underwire in front is uncomfortable would like same bra without the underwire can wear for short time,1
perfect answer to tops and dresses that are to low,2
i bought this dress for my 14yearold she will be wearing it to perform in a chamber ensemble it is gorgeous and more importantly she loves it,2
re blackblack adorbs style i am a solid 85 and average to narrow width this shoe was way too small odd because i have 2 other bobs shoes that are true 85 for great which is in fact why i ordered these i didnt read comments so maybe others mention this too beware you may have to return or exchange i did not reorder,1
he like everything except too tight and short and i ordered 85 when he wears 7 so not enough i tried them i have a narrow foot and they were too tight for me so returning them very disappointed not sure who they would fit,1
aunt loved it,2
cute but one side of the latch doesnt hold very well and the change falls out there are two compartments and the other side seems to hold ok so ill just use one side but it is a bummer,1
love the onesie would have given it 5 stars if not for the print peelingbr update i returned damaged onesie and reordered the reorder looks perfect cant wait for my little guy to wear it on valentines day,2
loved this hat it was perfect for my beach vacation and kept all sun off my face and shoulders i have a large head and it was a bit snug but still worked well and was very happy with its large brim and fun style,2
quality is in line with the price not amazing but i didnt expect amazing for the price very small though i ordered a medium my regular size based on previous reviews and took it out of the bag and immediately knew there was no way it would fit,0
i have worn columbia pants for years unfortunately most of their new ones feature pockets that are made of a loosewoven mesh this is utterly ridiculous pockets are an area that are going to get a lot of wearbr br the outer shell is great lightweight tough fabric that is comfortable and very durable cut and style are good pockets are worthless and will wear out literally ten times faster than the rest of the materialsbr br it is particularly galling that they do not tell you they have stupid mesh pockets not a pleasant or welcome surprise,0
well made and cute have had many compliments on it,2
i love them but they are super thin i had to buy some black shorts to go under them,1
if you have big thighs like i do order a few sizes larger the elastic in the waist and the belt loops will help keep them from sliding off good job wrangler,2
soft and comfortable,2
great boots lightcolor enough to not heat up in the sunbr lightweight to be comfortablebr already tested on hiking dogwalking biking scooterbr good gripbr i enjoy these better than the lowcut version you can untiebr them and they still stay on feet,2
they are comfortable and they look very nice,2
it fits great and is comfortable though it is so long i needed to have about 6 inches hemmed from the bottom just so it wouldnt drag,1
planned out a halloween theme with a group of friends with babies and we decided to do minions overall the costume is cute but pieces were poorly made the eyes on the headpiece arent facing the same direction and the neck line was a bit tight for my 9 month old son,1
white is too seethough,0
better than anticipatedbr worth every penny,2
look great,2
good craftmanship good color i has a lot of details that you can really appreaciate and that make the earring cool to watch although it is a little bit small for my ear and my other complaint is that they only sell one earing and i thought i would be cooler to add at least one small earing with a dragon stamped on it,1
i like these pajamas but would prefer the pants in a capri length or if they would have petite sizing but the material is great,2
okay for the low cost very thin chain clasp hard to do up,1
loved the shoes and wanted to keep them but how they were sized did not match my requirements even though i ordered exactly what i was supposed to for the length and width i needed,1
this watch has a bigger face than i normally wear but it is lovely and actually looks quite nice on my average sized wrist accurate time keeping and very stylish i love the anne klein brand in general,2
easy convenient and holds alot for its size,2
crappy material ears are weird they dont look like mickeys ears,1
i got these to wear for when i photograph weddings because my basic black sneakers always come untied the ked brand seems to be tighter in the width and shorter in the length than regular sizes the shoes were also very stiff and uncomfortable and hard to break in spend a couple bucks on something else and youll be happier,0
i wore this shirt once and washed it the shirt shrunk an entire size and it is not as long as it appears not flattering after a wash,0
these fit very well and are very comfortable they are shorter than formernownonexistentwintersilks they feel lightweight but provided warmth when worn under leggings in thirty degrees fahrenheit temps they measure about 27 inch inseam and feel like they could be worn as capris on 32 inch inseamunder tunic in warmer temps they are extremely soft and comfy hope to buy more,2
the gloves may be ok however they were way too small and i gave them to my wife order a size up from what you would normally wear,1
heavy could hardly see the wording chain turned greyblack with 4 daysbr it is pretty when not used,1
my great nephew requested a policemans uniform for christmas this fit the bill i had amazon ship it directly to his home his mom wrapped it for christmas morning she sent me a picture of him wearing it the expression on his face said it all he loves it it looks to be true to size and decent quality im sure he will get lots of hours of playtime in it and who knows we may have a budding police officer in our family i would highly recommend,2
no no no,1
i love this the size is perfect color is is perfect i want one in every color,2
great fit and keeps boobs up for the 5 min it stays sticky even when not sweating it does not stick very well i could not imagine having bigger boobs with this,0
they work good for my brother because of his swollen feet,1
the fabric was not as described and they were not true to size this is the 2nd purchase of clothing that weve purchased from amazon that is not as described wont be buying clothes from amazon again,0
very soft,1
dont waste your money they dont stay up,0
wow so the materials are nice and the proportions are too but this thing is tiny i thought they sent a kids shirt accidentally it is shorter and narrower than i thought it would be too small even for a mens small shirt even though what i ordered was medium because it was so short and narrow i cant even say go up two or three sizes honestly its a kids medium maybe large if you ask me,0
well the earrings are absolutely adorableunfortunately they arrived in awful condition the stand was broken completely in half one pair of earrings was missing and one earring was broken,0
very slippery soles,1
i like them fit wrll,2
i got these boots for my kids two months ago and they have only worn them a handful of times we live in new england so they have still needed their insulated snow boots most days both pairs have already cracked along the seam and allow water inside the boot they are really cute and comfortable but they do not hold up,0
too tight,0
big office fan good quality shirt and onesie,2
these laces work well for a person with special needs they make it easier to loosen the shoe take it off and also to put it on and tighten the laces there are no loose ends dragging to pose a risk of tripping they seem sturdy so far,2
theyre perfect,2
so cute soft comfy nice stretchy fits great better than the pictire,2
i work at a warehouse in cooler and freezer wearing this is all i need to keep my face and head warm i like how it has the adjustable sides to tighten over your nose an mouth if needed over all i say its with it for the price,2
hit with the wife,2
this is a nice looking shirt but again the material is super flimsy its about like tshirt materialbr br it is very lightweight i was hoping to wear it out for date on saturday night but i dont think its good enough for thatbr br its very flimsy and cheaply made it would be great for going to the grocery store a quick errand but thats about all thats good for,1
these pants fit well but are really long for average length tailoring expense makes them not a great bargain,1
nice looking unfortunately getting them in my husbands normal size fit but caused his finger to get skin problems from being too close to his skin as the silicone sticks his finger under the ring looked like hed been in the bath for the day i think well stick with metal style rings,1
its definitely more like a spandex feel than it says the bottoms fit decent but the crotch area is loose which is very odd the top is quite tight i am a 40dd so it hugged those super tight with an xl shift which usually isnt the case colors were spot on i was just sad the top bottom had flaws,1
i needed something heavier for winter it wasnt finished refund given quickly,0
i bought in the summer 0f 2013 wore them a little bit in the winter and this winter wore them 4 times and the seams on top all around the toe all came loose just separated almost like the material was dry rotted i feel this should not have happen and would like an explanation from tamarac if this is a fluke or what is wrong here for i am leary of buying anything from them again,0
wonderful quality,2
first the pros the paisley design is very pretty and the blue violet aqua colors are lovely nice feeling fabric also it has pockets and its not too skimpy for a quick trip to the supermarket on a hot day im a bit bosomy and although the large is still a bit too big im going to keep it and not waste time worrying if i dont meet hollywood and mtvs unrealistic bs charm and beauty standardsbr br however i removed a couple starsjust not quite true to size and getting rid of the chemical stench required about half a spray bottle of febreeze max immediately upon opening that killed any bad smell as far as i can tell it says hand washi stuck it in the machine on cool and delicate and took it out before final spin and let it drip dry no shrinkage or fading br br american womens clothes designers are apparently still living in the 18th century and the chinese are way ahead to no avail i have bitterly complained to the sales people at chicos and macys and dillards that i never buy casual clothes without pockets and those dinky little pretend pockets they sometimes tack on dont fool me i need something big enough for sunglasses maybe kleenex or a mask thank you for listening china,1
had these about 2 months and one of the sides has already ripped since it can not be returned for a refund i guess they go in the trash,0
nice shirt but didnt like it on myself material would also wrinkle super easy and didnt seem overly comfortable,0
videoidb365a5ba465ebfdf7248d58280855c4e i love love mine great value,2
beautiful pin great quality arrived quickly have it as gift and she loved it,2
the outside of this coat is soft the lining is terrible very cheap feeling and crinkly it literally makes a crinkling sound i usually wear xl ordered a 2x and it will not zip definitely runs small i really wanted to love this because its so pretty in the model pics,1
love everything about these,2
half of the panties in the pack were the size i ordered and the other half were 4 sizes too large like what the heckbr br the only reason im giving 3 stars is because i do have an older daughter who can wear the larger sizes,1
no button holes and buttons where too big for the size of the button space to fit i had to cut the holes open but need to buy new buttons that will fit through,1
huge i wear large but this was just too big had to return,0
the bathing suit is very cute and my daughter loved it unfortunately it is s little high cut causing it to ride up a lot it is slightly small in my daughter who is very thin for her age,1
la tela la comodidad,2
broke the first time i used it waste of money,0
seam runs down back of skirt,1
it was a little tight for gay guys getting this or guys in general id suggest going up a size from whatever you think you might be or maybe even two sizes still a cute crop and youll get everyones attention with this on,1
fitting not as expected,0
low quality thin fabric almost like paper boxy fit runs very large yet no stretch anywhere so its tough to get just the right fit,0
way too small order two sizes up,0
maybe its because i have small wrists as an adult woman buy this was still too large for practical use and it doesnt really have the same attributes as a scrunchie just looks like one,0
i bought as a birthday gift and he really liked it stylish fit well,2
i wear a large normally and i ordered an extra large barely fit over my breasts almost like it was a size small,0
the purple part of the necklace was beautiful however the pighter leaves were to be a pinkishlight purple the four lighter leaves look like there was ugly pink glue on them and the big leaf looks like the purple flaked off pretty necklace and would have kept it too if it were all the purple leaves and not four pinkish leaves,0
one letter in name was crooked and not the size of other letters,0
feels nice and comfortable just not very compression,0
the carved bone is beautiful the hooks made of a cheap material,1
velcro sticks to everything not like apple watch band,0
i wear ties on an almost daily basis and this has got to be my favorite tie ive owned in a long time i receive compliments almost every time i put it onbr br the quality is topnotch and has held up through much use it looks good and feels good too,2
the neck shape does not look rounded as it should be is kind of crooked,0
comfy,2
its comfortable,1
these are very very small if youre looking for bling or to be noticed these are not for you i reordered larger earring to replace these,0
beautiful unfortunately they were too small,2
its really pretty but when i received it it did not work consistently,0
this product is truly amazing i used it with the woly suede brush to remove a red gatorade stain from my new stonecolored birkenstocksand the stain disappeared like magic if you have several suede items as i do this product is a must,2
looks very cheap and not good quality,0
i think for the price its worth it i was really hoping for a higher quality material i will use this set twice this year and then put it away for awhile,1
beautiful purple color fits well a bit long so i may shorten it but it is great for a tunic for ladies who want to cover their rear end made well really nice,2
i was the hit of the 80s party with this top and wild tights the mullet hair helped tooits a well made top very comfortable,2
this dress fits perfectly through out the medium fits like a custom dress no slimming undergarments needed perfect to wear as a wedding guest or to an evening event just what i was looking for,2
this towel was too short for the price,2
a little bit on the cheap quality but not entirely bad,1
these are cute but cheap i was expecting a little better quality but they are cheap i dont know if these will turn green or if they are hypoallergenic but once my daughter wears these i can give a better review for now they just look cheap and a little bent on one,1
i like the canvastype fabric but it isnt for people who have a bust,0
the shirt is very cute the material is very comfortable and good price,2
its better in person great material made well exactly what i was looking for my sons graduation,2
fits perfectly on my fitbit charge hr 3 comfortable to wear,2
happy with it,2
perfect,2
i bought this for my daughter for her birthday it is very pretty the design on it is awesome but i didnt check the dimensions of the necklace it is huge my daughter thought it was pretty as well and she told me liked it but she only wore it on the day of her birthday and has not worn it since it is definitely designed for a man i wouldnt let this review say that you shouldnt purchase this piece because it is beautiful and well made,1
band was inflexible when you put it through the bracket and folded it back it would not fold flat but formed a loop,0
granddaughters love them,2
received yesterday wore for 8 hours then the screw popped out holding the buckle was able to screw back in so will have to wait to see if it holds or the screw s stripped,1
i ordered a medium based on size recommendations it runs small so size up the fabric is thin and i could see thru it,0
good piece for layering,2
cute sarong priced fair shipped quickly this gets 4 stars because the red is not red its pink ironically there is no pink color to choose from again i chose redi specifically wanted red because of the contrast bought it for a bday gift too late to return thats my gripe,2
product fit great,2
this one broke too i guess you get what you pay for disappointed,0
exactly what i was looking for,2
waist too small,0
awesome and beautiful just fade too fast but otherwise are comfy and soft,1
the hat fits shorter heads and sits up high on my head doesnt fit very snug its a nice looking hat just doesnt fit my head as well as id like,1
i think they say naturally faceted to state they might be non machine made and done by hand but not sure if these are natural sourced gems i included a photo to show the off color of the ruby i am pleased just felt the product over all was a 35 star they are heavy pieces light doesnt really pass through the stones either,1
these memory foam slippers are supper soft to the touch and keep your feet very warm no heel so slip in and out easily the only thing that would make them nicer is if they didnt have the hard plastic sole so you could walk quietly on the hardwood floors,2
this is the second one of these i have bought really a great watch for the price with a ten year battery cannot go wrong with a timex if you have a large wrist you might want to avoid this band i have a small wrist and it fits pretty tight the dial is very easy to read which is great for this old guy,2
i bought this for a christmas gift for my son he normally where is an extra large but when i received it from amazon its a very small extra large,0
wife loved the boots but they were a bit too snug like 12 size too small,1
would have assigned 5 stars if it was more durable,1
this case is a very good size for carrying the necessities i also like that it may protect me from credit card thieft,2
fits great washs well,2
i love the style so much 2 days later l whenbr back on amazon and bought another pair lol and thinking about getting another pair no joke they are color jet black and l love dark black,2
i wanted to keep this but the armpits are oddly cut and when you lift your arms it messes with the whole look of the dress the rest of the dress tailored waist and nice skirt is very flattering maybe i just have small arms and rib cage sadly i must return,1
nice for the price not croched crochet look machine made crochet is only made by hand cannot be done by machine but it is nice runs small order up at least one size if you are an abundant woman,1
these rings are amazing i work on farms with heavy machinery and large animals and wearing a metal ring could mean losing a finger these rings are perfect the colors are awesome and they fit perfectly i ordered a size smaller than i normally wear because they do stretch just a bit,2
the sizing just doesnt work the top was massive and it was too long but the top was very top large but i could barely get my head through it,1
erghaehwrg,2
the photo color looks beigesoft tan but in reality it has a pink tone to the pants the pants are very very small i had to get a refund which stinks because i did love the pants,0
this shoe wasnt for me but its pretty good i like the feeling of the bumpy foam but i always wear socks which hung up on the foam then its actually a pretty flat shoe and i like more of a rolltoe sole,2
used it to organize my pocket edc,1
not only is this idea brilliant but the product is exactly as advertised great way to make laceup shoes accessible to those who cant tie their own shoesbr br thanks laceez,2
theres a dingy gray band around the inside of the collar that stands out and looks awful amazon shows the shirt on their site as an open collar but hides the dingy band i had to button it all the way up like a stiff when i wore it the first time disappointed,0
quality is not as good as the impression given in the description unfortunately missed the return window due to vacation,0
the product fits great but my son has only worn this outfit twice and the straps on the pants are falling off im kind of disappointed,1
as a 21 yr old male the bandana is a little bit small its a good deal for the price though,1
very nice sturdy key chain bright colors and even nicer than i expected too soon to know how well it holds up but i really like the look and smooth feel of it great gift for a fan of the series,2
fits a little odd and rides up quickly lines from the edges and straps can easily be seen under dresses so its not a great slip v cut also doesnt go as low as it looks on the model on mebr i kept it because its better than nothing but constantly adjusting it really wears on my nerves and makes me look not as classy as i should in a dress that would require a slip,0
as shown in my review these slippers were great for about 10 months now the inserts on one foot slides to the left causing me to walk on the outside of my foot i will need to purchase other slippers as this is a poor design causing your foot to hurt when you walk in thembr br i just received these today when i put them on my big toe on one foot was touching i wear a 9 12 w the first line of the description says to order one size down so i ordered a 9 these have a wide toe box and plenty of room for a wide foot after about an hour wearing these they somehow adjusted to fit perfectly the foot bed is great by far the best slippers i have ever wornbr br okay it is july 1st i wear these at all times i am at home still love them,0
hard to do since i ordered wine colored top got freaking ugly multi color garbage,0
beautiful dress,2
fit perfectly and looks amazing everyone looks down at my shoes and compliments great looking shoes for the price going to buy more,2
the fabric is soft and a bit heavy the fit is too fitted for me and very tight around my 48 bust and rib cage i was looking for something loose flowy and cool this is not it,1
great shirt exactly what my son wanted,2
sent back,1
i brought this dress in red and black and i love it prefect fit and the right length it was very flattering to ones figure,2
we were beyond excited about the concept of toeless nylons but unfortunately for my daughter they literally ran straight out of the package she did not even get the first leg up to the knee before her fingers went straight through the obnoxiously cheap fabric an hour before her homecoming dancebr thank you for starting her very special night off with tears and stress none of us will soon forget it,0
i really cant rate this watch because i did not get the right one i ordered the grey but received the yellow so i returned it however the yellow watch was not at the same quality as a different bling jewelry watch that i love it was lighter and less substantial,1
very scratchy,0
great working pants easy to wash lots of pockets which is convenientbr gave them a 4 star bc the quality is not worth 5 stars not very durable,2
difficult to keep straps in the device,1
its cute serving its purpose soft leather that looks classy,2
much too large must return,0
even after i washed them and used softener they were like sandpaper seems like it was the black only pastels that i ordered separately were not like this,1
i had read the reviews so i was prepared for the small fit but this is ridiculous the straps are really cheap and thin so they have already worn down and have small tears in them the cups are odd they are hard as well and make my breasts look misshapen and its not comfortable at all im really disappointed and i dont know how this purchase worked out for other people but it did not work out for me d,0
exactly as advertised,2
these broke after normal and little use just snapped apart when i was unfolding them,0
mittens kept my fingers from freeazing but the thumbs and index fingers are too small and uncomfortable i only use these when necessary in bitter cold weather driving a tractor to plow snow long gauntlets are in conflict with my coat sleeves and tend to push them off for the price they save frostbite,1
too small he cant wear,0
wanted red not burgundy the color name they chose did not accurately represent the fact they are maroon,1
this is cute the material is soft and flattering but go down a size it runs super huge,1
every time i wear this dress i get so many compliments girls stop me and ask where i got the dress everyone loves the good vibes it instantly makes people smile i ordered a size medium which does fit but im very busty and its maxed out at the bust it may effect the graphics over time but for now no issues length is perfect and i am 54 160lbs pockets girlsshall i say more,2
good product,1
i ordered blue but received black i like them enough not to send back but i did want the blue,1
wore the pink pair one time and both socks have holes in the toes,0
dont waist your money spend a few more bucks buy socks that will last more than 2 months,0
the tab that holds the back of tire was sewn in wrong,0
fit nicely in the armsshoulders too tight in the chest and short length im a 36dd and bought an xl returned the items material is soft though,0
the quality of the leather is incredible at this price construction feels very high quality the style is not as chunky as it appears in the photos which pleased me the fit is true to size maybe a touch on the smallish side i have narrow to average width feet and found the width just right in size 8 the calf is also on the narrow side a plus for my stickshaped legs probably not a good fit for wide calves love these boots,2
looked very nice strap frayed the first day of use,0
thats ok,1
i bought these to wear at annual krampus events with a group of local free thinkers read lots of tutorials on how to make your own horns but these were perfect stayed out and were comfy enough to wear all night only wish it were acceptable to wear them on a daily basis,2
i bought this to help with a volunteer post at a function after one wash this thing shrinks i followed the directions exactly i will never purchase this item again nor do i recommend anyone to buy this i am normally a 1x to 2x and got a 3x which came small this thing is now useless to me i am not happy or satisfied for the price i paid for this,0
not thick like the old school type,1
nice for good price the snaps at the bottom fell apart i dont want to but i have to return it if they can improve the snaps its gonna five stars,0
these cured my belly piercing thanks they are not too small for my holeespecially as it was new these are perfect for new piercing which you are trying to heal up and it worked for me,2
very soft and warm wife wears it after nine and then she frequently wears it to bed it was a christmas gift to her,2
i ordered thinking it would be a little big but it was almost too small it is a very lovely dress but will not be able to wash it think it may be really too small then will order larger size next time thanks,1
okay cant figure out how to wear it,1
speer cute and comfy id recommend ordering a size up though im a large and it fit more a medium on me definitely recommend though it would have been better if the fit was correct other than that i loved it,1
its fine enough doesnt provide an amazing amount of support but its fine enough,1
the sizing is all over the place with these i ordered a 6 since my son currently measures at a 55 they arrived and were so large that they flopped around and just looked huge on him returned them for a smaller size and that size wouldnt even go on his foot returned those and chose to buy locally and pay more for a different brand that are size 6 and fit perfectly,0
very comfortable my new favorite undies,2
i work as a cna and figured this watch was a good alternative to a wrist watch that always gets in the way of handwashing i have used it 3 times and the smiley face came right off apparently the smiley face is only a sticker dont waste your money,0
everyone loves this earrings very lightweight for the ears,2
i loved the color of this bathing suit but it did not fit me well i am a size medium in bathing suit bottoms they felt kind of tight,1
the lenses are good but the frame started falling apart a week of having them i dont know how easy youd have to be on them for them to last but with regular usage not good,0
i cant tell you how much i love this dress its gorgeous and high quality with a belt or jacket or alone i get soooo many compliments when i wear it it fits your size exactly no need to size up or down casual or formal gorgeous,2
really like the wallet the zipper sticks only concern is if will last,2
not nearly as heavily made as original band loops,0
my wife loves these says they fit her perfectly great products from this place,2
not the greatest product they seem alittle cheap i bought these and the leopard print ones the zebra ones fit but the others are way to wide both the same size,1
its a nice shirt but it does run a bit large and the shirt is very thin,1
a the top is a little loose but my waist is bigger than bust i still love it just wish fabric was thicker,2
i love the top but it is very tight i whish our clothing would be available in the proper sizes a large used to be a large a medium a medium etc now a days a size large is actually only a small for this reason im only giving 3 stars,1
the sizing is different from other bali products ive purchased,1
slightly smaller than expected under the arms but the body of the shirt fits as expected unfortunately wow does the color bleed i prerinsed this top in my laundry room sink and after a third sink of water i was still getting dye runoff clearly this is hand wash alone until further notice,1
im 5 1 with a 34b 27 waist 386 hips a small fit perfectly looks just like the pic will go prefect with my demonia boots and my converse will be ordering the white one too,2
bought this to experiment with the size i am 5134 126lbs and it is way too small would cost too much to return so will just give it to someone much smaller than i am,1
ive purchased them twice always too big they run a whole size bigger than normal,0
grossly undersized at least two sizes too small also it is not a sweatshirt as it appears just a cheaply made shirt with a hood the item arrived a full month late and then they charged me to return it not a good experience in any form,0
its nothing great about to mentionbut the black mask gave me black heads on my nosei was wondering why in an hour suddenly they appeared that too so clear and darkthen i realized its because of the black color of the mask,0
very uncomfortable fabric feels very scratchy terrible when your thighs rub together sizing guide was correct at least,0
not good,0
good,2
after reading the reviews i ordered a 12 size larger than normal turned out their sizes are accurate at least for my foot so i returned the shoesbr the shoes are fairly stiff and may require inserts to improve comfort they appeared to be of fairly good construction for the money,1
fits just right and love the look as seen in ybr the photo,2
very bummed this is a great looking watch but the very short band was disappointing i have went to several jewelry stores and no one could help lengthen itlooks like i have to pay to send back a misrepresented product,0
i love this sweater to pieces xo i got it in the pretty pastels after seeing it on on social media and it is soft and looks nicely homemade i do think its designed to look slouchy or oversized and i ordered a size downso glad i didi ordered a small and i normally wear a medium and it fits perfect i got a great deal too and couldnt be happier one of my favorite amazon buys yet thanks,2
way to big for a small,0
this is so small i was expecting for 13 dollars to at least be a bit larger 210,0
love love love,2
dress is so cute but cant wear it because of the sheerness leaves nothing to the imagination,1
love the top but unfortunately it runs small thru the arms and shoulders i am going to return it,1
its perfect for everything my granddaughter has to carry with lots of space,2
lightweight and perfect for the office,2
will make the best gift decent quality,1
runs too small poor quality,0
this bracelet stay stretched out of shape when i tried to put it on my wrist unlike others that have ordered that i can reshape to fit once its put in my wrist,0
beautiful ring,2
material is nice but these definitely are not comparable to nvgtn at least not their latest release i agree with a previous review about the too much fabric in the crotch area maybe its just the blue color because thats the one i got as wellbr br these also run larger than the nvgtn ones i dont recommend to size up,0
look cute but feel flimsy and very thin,0
really nice color comfortable fit runs true to size,2
beautiful but broke first time wearing it,1
likeable but cheap materials doesnt lay flat like the photo,0
the picture is chipping away it was pretty,1
i was excited to have these because i walk my dogs at night and i want to be seen from afar after 2 blocks i checked them and noticed that one was on the verge of falling off and the other had also slipped out of place a bit i adjusted them walked the additional 2 blocks to my house and one fell off as soon as i got to my front door i was walking a bit on the slow side so i know this wouldnt work for any kind of running,0
i love the style and print of this suit but it is really large in the bust area i am not exactly small busted but not huge either but it just seems like way too much material also seems to be extra material around the hips that bunches at the waist maybe i am just too short for the cut i was really disappointed because i wanted to love it i dont think going down a size would have fixed the problem either it seemed well made just more material than necessary for a spandex item that should have some stretch and give to it,1
good quality protective from the sun but definitely bigger than the picture shows a more oversized frame think paris hilton,1
the color is a darker raspberry not a bright pink flattering and comfortable not see through at all i needed to use static guard because of the fabric but other than that its great it is about 2 inches from the top of my knees,2
it is great for the price the customer service was very good they were quick to respond and helped me a great deal,2
i was disappointed on how cheaply it was made i feel as though i wasted my money,0
i love big but this is way too big i still kept it though lol maybe one day ill be brave enough to wear it without feeling like a bumblebee lol,0
i purchased 3 of these shirts for my husband he loves them he works outside in the summer heat and so he needs cool and comfortable clothing they are well made and look nice to they wash and wear easily,2
i ordered this in the black shinny color and its more like black smudge marks all over it that wont go away it actually looks used but it will do for the purpose intended dont order the black if you want the shinny look its not that type of material they need to take out the word shinny in the advertisement,1
these ship from china they are not like the picture posted made very bad very thin,0
first of all let me say that these beads are beautiful and except for the pair in the second picture which are acrylic all beads are glass which is why it is a shame that only a very few have single core grommets and one of those was broken third picture i mainly bought the set for the pair of beads that appear to be simulated turquoise stone fourth picture as this is my birth stone and they even have silver grommets though not single core the last few pictures are close ups of the beads as anyone can see the designs a lovely its just a shame about using shoelace grommets in the place of proper single core bead jewelry grommets i even received a pair of beads with no grommets at all final photo,1
if you have anything bigger than a pencil sized wrist this watch is not for you,1
very pretty gave as a gift and the receiver was very happy,2
my almost 5 yo daughter absolutely loves those socks they seem to feet her well and stay up she wears size 12 kids shoes,2
my daughter normally wears 3t this outfit was great in length but the waist was a little tight for her the shirt fit perfectly so it served its purpose for pictures,1
the material is stretchy and it fit me nicely i was worried that it would be too tight but it fit great i ordered a medium and the top was a little big when i held it up to me but when i put it on it fit just right,2
i ordered these in december 2020 after 4 months i squatted to pick something up and the crotch tore note that the seam did not split rather it was the cloth that failed ive never had trouble with dickies before i think the stone wash went too far in weakening the cloth,0
these socks are advertised to be nonbinding they were ok before i laundered them then the size was so narrow around the ankle they are not wearable i normally do not have trouble with socks being too tight just wasted my money,0
very cute but super short and i even sized up,1
wife insisted i need gray socks to go with the kaki shorts i have you sent wrong color wife thinks its my fault socks are great well made and worth the money just wrong color wife was,2
i love shwings but these are too neon way too neon,0
excellent dont waste money on snake boots,2
cozy top but size small is too big for me at 52 and 125 lbs color is not really kaki more a golden beige not very flattering with my fair skin tone,0
this pajama set is soft and comfy but the material is very thin and cheap one wash and they tore disappointed because they will notbr last long,1
as a flight attendant it is important to me to take food for 24 days depending on the trip and this bag is roomy for much food and ice bag and holds the cold in well additional compartment for nonrefrigerated foods is large and another compartment for condiments and dinnerwear has easy access thank you for this bag,2
this fit fine however theres this weird silky material on the inside that shows because the collar folds over it makes the vest look cheap and poorly made i returned this product,0
dont wear for more then an hour uncomfortable,1
only carried it a few times in about a week it started to tear by the zipper poorcheap quality canvas this is probably worth no more than 10,0
garbagesave your money and get a real name 300 jacket during clearance sale at the end of the season for 50 instead youll be happy u didand so will your kidsnow theres an ahhh haaa moment for ya,0
i didnt like the bulkiness of the jacket i imagine it was warm but simply was to big and heavy for recreational use,0
first off they do look nice and feel great but the issue is that they have this weird large bunching happening see photos at the waist like so much so that it balloons out near the waist i dont know if i got a bad pair but its pretty noticeable i dont have time to return them as bought them for a trip so ill just figure something out disappointing,0
so far great suitcase husband travels a lot and has said this suitcase has made it way easier to get around the airport hard shell is also much more protective,2
highly satisfied im a 38dd its very hard to find a supportive bra period let alone a sports bra this one is great even better than my victoria secret brand one it is so comfortable i wear it around the house i love the layer that hides cleavage the best part is it holds your breasts and doesnt hurt to do full out exercises i used to not do anything that required jumping i have a lil more slack in the straps even after adjusting all the way up so im gonna go a size or cup down so i can get an extra strong hold when i buy more,2
el monedero me gustó mucho pero a menos de tres 3 meses veo que se está pelando por dentro es una pena,0
looks works and feels great bout this style of casio to replace other bigger casios i was wearing as you can see in the pic my scar from my previous watches alwas hurt my wrist this watch is thin profile and doesnt hurt me while twisting my wrist around perfect very satisfied,2
other i got a defective one or there is a quality issue here i ordered the jacket in july liked it initially so kept it my son started wearing it in october when it got cold after a month of light wear the stitching started coming apart at the sleeves since the return window closed i couldnt return or exchange it contacted amazon customer service to see if anything could be done leena from cs was plain out rude giving two stars and not one just because the jacket keeps my son warm,0
i loved this mask when i saw itbeing a crazy cat lady i couldnt wait to get this mask inbr wish i would have not wasted my money on it there had to be something in the material because it broke the whole left side of my face out and my nose and chin i thought it may have been the medication i was taking but then i decided to change masks so i could wash the kitty one my face immediately started to clear up so no i would not recommend this mask to anyone,0
i had to return these they fly off my feet every time i take a step if the straps were adjustable that would be helpful but they are not,0
i love this sweater you can wear it with anything,2
got these for my high school age runner they changed the shoe this year but he liked this model so much that i ordered 2 more to keep him in running shoes for a while very stable heel not raised up too much toe box plenty roomy not so padded that they loose shape or size can wear them for a good long time and they keep shape and size and the bonus made in the good old usa,2
bought it because of recent fraudulent charges on my account have yet to have any problems gave this a 4 because i have not seen with my own eyes any problems concerning the rfid blocking otherwise great color and lots of room for many cards and money,2
really flimsy construction i wanted a lightweight suitcase but i didnt expect to receive one that made me fearful for the viability of the contents i packed in it this suitcase traveled to europe over the christmas holidays it was not overpacked for my return stateside as i had a second bag having said that the cheap plastic buckle on the interior securing webbing broke and i had to tie it to keep the contents secured,1
loved the fit hated the snaps and pockets,1
the right shoe is visibly smaller than the left even though they both say the same shoe size on them hurts my foot very disappointed,0
i bought it in grey 7cd and it is very comfy doesnt have perfect arch support but cushioned footbed and medium heel height makes your walk soft and easy is true to size and i highly recommend it,2
i love this night gown its so soft and light and surprisingly long i am 5 9 250 lbs and it goes down to my lower calf i wish it went down the my ankles like some on the other reviewers said but at 59 that is never possible they just dont make pajamas for tall women the sleeves go down to my wrist which is perfect usually all pajama sleeves fit like 34 sleeve the buttons at the top are really nice i hate collars too close to my neck overall this was a great find i am very happy,2
the coat fitted very tight at the bottom too much room on the arms,0
for around 20 youre getting a premium deck w a graphic as well as some nice wheels that have some solid bearings and the trucks slide great,2
they fit and look really nice highly recommend,2
i had purchased this for my son he is 14 i did not notice the beer can in the pocket of the guys shirt i thought it was funny and he would get a charge out of it and he did purchased a fabric pen so i would color this out not thinking that it is appropriate for a 14 year old to wear like it otherwise,1
the texture is rough and it sheds badly returned it i so wanted to love it,0
it did not give on my arm made a beautiful pen,0
what the heck i have other items from this brand and havent had issues got this today and washed it and this is how it came out customer service already refunded me thank goodness very disappointed,0
sleeves are short and its brown not yellow will be fine for a throw on and go sweater its comfy just not quite what i expected,1
colorful fits well washes well i hang dry i love it,2
the cut of the shirt is very square giving it a very blousy feel when on i should of ordered a size smaller material is shiny smooth feels sort of tech if you get it to fit could be a great camp shirt,1
not as described material very silky thin material,1
not a true silver more like light gunmetal color i kept anyway because of great price,1
comfy sweater so comfy that i bought in 2 colors but one of them the strings came out in the wash and were impossible to feed through the hood the other one one of the metal pieces came off one of the strings never to be found again hazard for kids pets also easy to snag,1
this outfit is super adorable it fits my son well and is comfortable it washes really well and comes out of the dryer ready to wear again,2
i really like this band period is comfortable and weighted perfect so it feels like good quality solid wristband i am 100 satisfied and would recommend anyone to buy this the only drawback is that little pins that will it to the watch face can easily pop out if youre not careful otherwise its an amazing product,2
awsome product the seller is great i had made a mistake with my order and he was fast to respond for fix my issue this looks awsome and it fits well really like it,2
this belt is way wider that what it looks in the picture but its not too bad so i kept it,1
i am 51 about 130 lbs i am sort of petite yet very curvy i usually wear a small or medium the fit around my waist was loose but not too bad although i thought it would be tighter on my hips and thighs maybe not exactly tighter but go in to hug my figure it just looks like a regular skirt thats too big on me but the material was nice enough and ill just alter it id still recommend this item,1
very comfortable love the color and the texture,2
tried on my nose and magnet not strong enough returned,0
they look cute but are way too small and didnt have much give to stretch my 3 year will not wear them this tight on his ears they also did not have any type of lining in the inside so they werent soft i would have sent them back but my dog ate one,0
love them,2
these dont stick very well,0
the bag is what was described however it was a prime item and delivered two days late,1
i needed this to wear a skeleton jumpsuit with all my girlfriends in new orleans unfortunately the product was way thin and i didnt feel comfortable wearing it it looked cool other than that,0
i bought these to work in the yard,1
has a very nice and snug fit this does run a little small and can be see through if its too tight so beware of that but they are nice,2
well made but a little smaller than id like almost doesnt fit my iphone not room for much else high quality otherwise,2
overall the product was good however there appeared to be a tear in the fabric,1
very cheap product,0
this bag is nicely made the material feels strong and seems like it can hold up to a lot of wear and tearbr br the interior of the bag is divided in two sections by a zipper which is useful for separating clean from dirty clothes or toiletries from clothes etcbr br there are a good number of pockets the front has a picket in the middle and top the interior has the aforementioned divided section as well as some organization pocketsbr br the threeway travel is just a top handle a side handle or by using the back pack straps i like that the straps can be neatly placed in their own compartments to keep them out of the way if you are not using thembr br it can carry a 15 inch laptop in a very nicely padded section if you are the type of person who puts stickers on their laptop the tag is actually a sticker you can peel offbr br i wish this bag was a little larger it doesnt expandbr br overall this is a high quality bag but i dont see ever getting more than one overnights stay worth of clothes in it,2
the size was perfect color was the light blue we wantedbr it was just what my daughter wanted and i neededbr arrived in a great timely mannerbr material is thicker than i imagined too which was great for covering her body toobr she felt very comfortable wearing it all day and even in front of the boys,2
garter at the hemline is too tight,0
great all purpose duffel the expandable zippers are a nice touch to add about an inch or so of length to either side the canvas is a little on the lightthin side but it seems durable to mebr br update 5 62 2 stars a couple months and probably less than a dozen uses and the shoulder strap hinge on the bag broke off meaning i can no longer the shoulder strap it still works like a normal duffel bag but i can only carry it by hand now i still like the style of the bag and the type of canvas which is salvaging a star here but the durability is not there,0
i ordered these in space grey and black and am returning both they are too thin to remain opaque or provide any compression you can see my skin tone through both im 56 and 150lb and i ordered mediums,1
me quedo bien,1
this was birthday gift for my grandson and he loved it,2
the broom does not detach i checked with the seller to make sure also even though the description includes that it is a beach hat do not let it get wet or it shrinks very disappointed the misleading description,0
im so bummed i was looking forward to getting several pair of these cobians after seeing ads on saltwater fishing and reading the reviews to my dismay these things squeak sooooo loud my feet are not sweaty i have several other kinds of flip flops these jumps are the only ones that squeak maybe they will breakin at this point im not enjoying wearing these at all,0
good,2
pictures dont ever look the same when u put it on,1
i have a hard time with compression shorts riding up when i run these really do stay in place yes im 510 and weigh 170 i have a 305 waist and the medium fit perfect these are my go to running shorts i run 4 times a week more than 5 miles each run,2
after using this wallet for about 2 weeks the zipper broke its cute and all but not sturdy starting to rip down the side too not worth the money and shipping,1
best slippers ive ever wornbought 3 pair thick padded soles let me walk outside to check mailbr br ordered another 2 pair exactly as first orderamazon shipped different style slippers twice,1
this dress is very very short one of the buttons has already fallen off total bummer,0
i wanted a loose fitting shirt to exercise in so i ordered a size up it was extremely tight in the chest very disappointing since i liked the color and lightweight material,0
so little omg not pleased at all,0
i was very pleased on how fast these pants came in i ordered them on monday and got them the next day but i read in some reviews that these pants run big but they dont i ordered a medium because i can usually wear mediums but they were way too tight they barely buttoned and i felt like my butt and thighs were about to bust the seams i am returning and ordering a bigger size so thats no problem also the color is not what it looks like in the picture i read one persons review that said they came in like a hot pink that is actually why i ordered them because i wanted something super bright and hot pink im in love with the color just not with the sizing just consider if you dont like highlighter neon super bright pink then dont get the rose pink option and order a size up,1
i am 57 130 pounds and i got a small cute fitted sweater and is very warm,2
i love the dress its perfect just as the picture color is really elegant and material is really good,2
this purse is amazing great size lots of space and sturdy zippersvery good sale fast shipping,2
not enough harness to go around a normal size tree flat harness and soft makes it hard to move it up as you go up,0
no es original y a calidad es mala,0
videoidf68462b33f1ef437dc6de65e4f84d2a8 i love these bags they are great colors i have three and after having large bags for work and enjoying my designer bags i find myself drawn to the casual ease of a simple fun bag great for vacation shopping and matching up w sports wear you will enjoy the ease of this little gem the hardware is done so attractive zips work smoothly nice little side pockets hold back keys money glasses and lipstick holds everything for a day or night out the price is great i ordered straps on amazon to change up the look great little find everyone loves them another plus is the are light so cross body you wont even know its there very pleased,2
theyre like 1 to 2 seizes too small which is weird cause they stretch my husbands wedding vabd doesnt stretch yet it fits these say theyre the sane size but wouldnt fit and were tight,1
make sure that you get the size you need because you cant return this it cost 300 just to return it because it comes from overseas,1
sadly not what i expectedbr target underwear are more comfortable,0
whats the deal in order to take a leak i have to unsnap my pants pull pants down and underwear theres no easy access opening i will be packing these up and sending back i feel scammed again by online shopping dont young people still need this,0
im 57 and i ordered a largebr they fit comfortably im glad i ordered the large because the medium would have been a tight fit jogger and i was wanting loose fitbr these have held up well in the washer and for wear i wear them about once a week and have had them for 3 months nowbr they are very comfortable,2
great for diving and all water sports protects from sun well fits nicely good quality material and zipper,2
im giving it 3 stars only because the velcro and the little piece of metal that loops the velcro is s not really well made,1
they break too easilyotherwise ok,1
i had to add a rubber washer to the base of the tree the screw in part in order for the tree to stand up without the washer it wobbled aside from that the tree is nice and it does hold a lot of earrings,1
did not like anything about this garment,1
shoes were a little narrow on my granddaughter,1
nice robe,2
the color and material is nice im 5 ft 5in and this is way too short comes up mid calf and i dont have long legs i was hoping it would be floor length my fault for not checking the measurements,1
its cold this time of year in the pacific northwest so i hoped this would be good to hold off the winter chill it actually looks really cheap like a low end stuffed toy it does feel warm like sweatinducing warmth it made me overwhelmingly hot and sweaty then itchy i just cant recommend this at all,1
perfectly matches my daughters school uniform i wish i knew the plaid i think it is 51 or 53 so that i could find more products in this plaid print expensive shipping for its size and weight could be mailed in a regular envelope with hand cancel written on the outside,2
overall this romper is very cute it fits will around the body but is definitely shorti struggle to get in and out of it because its short im only 5 4 customer service is good thoughi contacted them about the issue and they were apologetic and offered two options to remedy the issue,1
missing an earring and missing a red jewel in the necklace,0
i ordered the largest size to accomodate a cloth diaper the romper is quite small and barely fits my 17 lb 6 mo old the workmanship is low quality i had to knot a few stiches that were unraveling and resew an unraveled seam prior to washing,0
the vest was as described,2
holds wrinkle out real well,1
not for summer,0
the product came in and it does not fit like and xl also the straps were not sewn on properly they are all twisted and do not lay flat i got this as a gift from a stranger and have no way of getting this item replaced i am very unhappy after waiting for months to get this swim suit in time for vacation now its not even sewn together well i want a replacement asap,0
cute skirt but difficult to get out the wrinkles in the pleats that got there during transit makes me think that it would be equally difficult after laundering,1
material is really thin and super clingy order 2 sizes up,0
good quality shorts size up at least 1 size runs way small,1
this item description has all of the writing in english however when i received it it came in chinese,0
i love my purchase of my gemstone tennis bracelet it is better quality than i had expected,2
i shouldve sized up they fit ok but i know i only have a few hours in these for 10 i will keep them,1
i ordered an xl just to be safe i wear a large but its too small fits more like a medium very disappointed,0
i wear a 12 size pant and was looking for a new pair of comfy work pants i wanted to love these but they fell short of expectations they left an odd baggy area in the groin but tight everywhere else i had to return this product,0
terrible dress its main qualities are that it is very thin and very shiney which are like the two worst things it could be every imperfection was visible and the front part was unwearable revealing i returned,0
super cutewhile they lasted broke after only wearing 4 times the back snapped in half and now theyre in the trash,0
acceptable or even betterbr i dont think that its really leather has a chemical smell,1
but cute,1
fabric is super stretchy like womens yoga pants not way the stated material composition is correct,0
bought these looking for nickel free earrings but they are the most uncomfortable earrings i have ever bought the post is more square than round and gets larger closer to the ear,0
based off of the reviews i decided to purchase an extra small for a more form fitting look wow am i glad i did normally i fit a small but my hips sometimes require me to purchase a medium my measurements bra size is 32 c height 5 ft 4 in weight 125130 i purchased this dress specifically for a nightime photo shoot down at anna maria island in florida it was a fun night out of restaurants bar hopping games every place i went to all eyes were on this curve hugging little black dress working its magic im glad i bought it pretty sure you will be too,2
material is thinner than expected but the fit is ok,1
does the job,2
i like to coordinate my glasses with my outfits these are a perfect shade of red a little deeper color they are also very durable feeling and have a very durable case,2
love these they aint beautiful but man are they comfy and great quality the real sheep fur lining is not too hot for texas summers but very warm in the winter,2
the shirt was very cute but im 205lbs and 52 i carry all my weight in my stomach and this just didnt look appealing on me,1
arrived broken,0
liked it except for the loops to attached to camera the little loops are too thick to feed through the small attachment mounts on the sides of my panasonic zs100 camera had to use cameras special loop adapters to which the ropeandleather strap could attach works but could be a cleaner appearance if the straps loops were of smaller diameter material,2
i love the flowy satin but i had to return them because they are so pointy that they pinch the sides of my foot a lot i have a pretty high tolerance for wearing high heeled shoes but this one was just too much for me maybe someone with a narrow foot would be comfortable wearing them i also noticed there were tiny sprinkles of excess glue on the tops of the satin folds probably because it is difficult to create the folds without using globs of glue i wonder if the folds would last in the long term worn as occasional evening shoes they might last awhile,1
it was too tight for me i have to give it to other person for free,0
will work for party,1
cute but it broke putting it on waste of money,0
good fit odd material mesh like seems like it will become linty pretty quick looks cheap but fits very well,0
fit our purpose but you get what you pay for and these are cheap they dont look like the picture so much but again they worked for us,1
im a womens size 7 with average calves these socks are just a little long in the foot the arch support wants to be back on my ankle and the heel pulls up off the heel of my foot the rest of the sock is very tight around my calf i dont want them to fall down but id rather have slouch socks than tight socksbr br theyre warm the toes are thicker than im used to so i feel the toe separation a bit more when i wear them with my fivefingers i can get used to that nice socks for winter if you can get past the calf squeeze,1
carrying clip came off the case within first week of use almost lost my glasses,0
looking at the low rating and reviews i thought whats there to mess up in this after getting found yes they can problem is the upper jaw and lower jaw doesnt align so when you try to press it doesnt push in the center i had to remove the lower jaw screw and just place the disk to press it down even then strictly speaking its still not level when pressing but it did work discs are fine get what you pay for since i use very rarely decided to just keep it,0
great glssses,2
courtesy of another reviewer i took her advice and ordered up a size lucky for me the xl fit like a smaller large and works for me think carhartt large as they size smaller than dickies or baleaf or 90degrees by reflex the xl will not fit anything heavy under it so this is a shell for light layering weather spring or fall or hiking altitudes in summer there is insulation but it is mild so its not a wind shell its a light jacketbr br sizing aside it seems wellmade i do like it stylewise and i find the shoulders arent so tight i cant move freely in it its good material has good pocketsnot all shallow and a strong zipper and hood but the sizing is such a warning point i had to dock the 2 stars i will definitely use this in the right season so long as i dont gain 5 lbs,1
perfection i love these pants for summer travel especially for longhaul flights im 5534 about 125 lbs and the 4 regular fits perfectly with a small wedge heel the rise is a tad under the belly button which i like keep in mind that the legs are wider than they appear in the picture they fit like neatlooking pajama pants i wear them with a tank and slouchy sweater on the plane add some clogs and i look relatively human and at the same time comfortable when i need to sleep the material is thin and slightly stretchy the dont 34swish34 too terribly when i walk like many travel pants do if you want a higher rise go up a size fyi ive tried every model of these pants i dont like a boot leg and the narrow leg fit like a sausage casing,2
very cute shoe but i wanted it for a big girl size 4 to 6 is what i ordered it was not the product that i wanted i wanted it for a big kid and i got it toddler size,0
i believe the dress i received is either a fake ck or was used the hangtag was attached to the back ck tag with just the plastic partno cotton thread or bead part holding it on ck dresses customarily have the hangtag under the arm and there were no loops to hold it on the hanger the zipper does not feel sturdy enough to be a real ck the fabric is much thinner than the usual scuba fabric i went down a size runs a bit large i usually wear a ck 18w 185 lbs and 59 i always size down on these sheath style ck dresses without princess seaming in front no lining no pockets i bought the silver lake version and the print seems oddly out of focus or blurred its an okay dress but the usedfake suspicions i have are strong,1
waaay too small and lousy stitching poor quality esp zipper rough fabric dont buy,0
these were made of the strangest material ever it says 100 cotten but they feel and sound like corn husks my son wouldnt wear them and nobody would buy them on resale they also shrunk to a tiny size,0
good quality my daughter is allergic to a lot of earrings finally found a kind she can wear thank you,2
pretty cheap looking but they were,1
good size,2
outstanding i wasnt sure what i would get but i was pleasantly surprised,2
i usually wear a size 7 or 75 ordered these in a 7 product received was 1025 inches long about a size 10 should have returned them otherwise they are very nice looking made well and good for very hot weather,1
wore one time and one broke,1
ran big but super soft,2
piece of crap the leather was ok but the buckle broke apart in my hands when i tried to pull the tag off of it definitely a lesson learned you get what you pay for i would have given it 0 stars but 1 star was as low as it would let me rate this pos,0
very comfortable,2
fits as expected but its not the material i expected i specifically looked up this particular combination of cotton and spandex it smells like sweat as certain cheap version of cottonspandex do if you wear it once and its hot outside and i do wear deodorant every day also not the texture i expected i have nightgowns 95 cotton 5 spandex that feel cool and soft this one doesnt feel the same,1
i wish they were full length but the fit design is awesome so i kept them and wear as ankle leggings im 5834,2
these are great my son loves them he doesnt normally like wearing socks but he will put these on with no complaints and actually likes to see whats printed on them i like that he doesnt slip and fall on my hardwood floors not too thick or thin and fit is good he wears a size 10 little kids shoe,2
i love this pocketbook the style is awesome they have improved the buckle on the front so that it has a button on the back witch everyone was saying it took to much time to undo and redo im so pleased with how they have took the reviews n improved their products thank u i will be buying from them again i want more color in this pocketbook,2
super cute perfect size really comfortable and lightweight sparkly and bright they stand out but dont look like costume jewelry i am very happy with my purchase,2
exactly what she wanted shes absolutely in love with it,2
it looks like maybe once upon a time it could have looked that way but was melted down to look like a blob of a mess it doesnt hardly cost anything but save that little bit of money,0
these are very thin belts you will need to lose weight around your belly if you dont want it flipping up on you each time you sit and stand the width is not very wide either,1
the dangers of buying boots onlinei wear a us mens 115 in virtually everything ordered these and man are they big so much room in the heel that i had to add heel pads and extrathick socks still wore a blister on my upper heel as far as looks go they are amazing not quite black and not quite brown kind of a very dark plum beautful bright coloured stitching like all nocona boots craftsmanship is impeccablebr if they fit true to size i wouldve given 5 stars,1
wore it 1 time and ripped right up the side cheaply made i worried about that when i saw it should have returned it,0
the heel is pealing off thats why i gave it 3,1
these are short on my daughter like booty peeking out when she barely bends over short on the up side theyll be fine as pajamas,1
wrong size i would like to return for an extra large how do i return,1
too large,1
after reading the other reviews here i bought a size 46 for my regularly size 23t toddler im glad i did because it definitely runs really small if she grows a little the 46 wont even fit her plus the seem popped i the shoulder area after 1 wear and 1 wash i had to stitch it up myself because it wasnt worth the hassle of returning,1
it was a good purchase for the price but you get what you pay for the colors are very vibrant and it seems to be good leather the only problem with it is some of the slots for your cards arent big enough and the threads are coming out,2
great,2
i have had some issues with my hands and was looking for earrings i could put on and take off without help these were perfect as they go into my ear easily and the cliplike backing is easy to manipulate i love the look too as these earrings are just the right size for me they are beautifully simple and i like wearing them,2
very comfortable and very cool in 100 temperatures however after the first washing the placket would no longer lie flat id probably not order this shirt again,1
the only shoe run in i can put them on right out of the box and run 10 miles with no problems,2
wow loving this top very flattering my 2nd one,2
i wore the socks once and they got a hole in them,0
i have purchased these charms in the past and have always been pleased with them they are nice quality for a decent price and make a really cute charm bracelet however in my most recent order one of the 6 sets was not as pictured they are 3 times the size of the other charms they are more like pendents than charms ill make them work for what i need but im a little annoyed that they are different,1
these shorts are a good value however they are smaller than expected my son wears a large and these fit more like a mediumbr the weight band is also pretty loosebr its not like your usual basketball shorts the elastic isnt very bunched up and feels like it wont last very long,2
great dress,2
this was a gift my friend could not quit raving about it she said she will wear it everywhere thank you so much for such a lovely item,2
my fault i admit but im annoyed with how this product is listed in dec 2018 i purchased the burgundy long sleeve dress i just came back to amazon hit purchase again to go to the listing to purchase a navy one found the navy option and boom its at my door now washed dryer and ready to go thats when i realized it was the short sleeve version and not what i wanted at all again my fault for not double checking but i hate when different styles are under one listing,1
very comfortable,2
nice and comfortable good for spring fall and part of winter,2
bought the 67 for my 5yo who wears a 6 the size is definitely a large 7,1
great deal soft and comfy keeps its shapebr,2
earrings are beautiful and ornate i cannot wear them however because it would look like i was wearing a pair of childs earrings they are also too small to be worn with long hair as they would not be visible the hooks are so tiny they will require a plastic stopper to keep them from coming out wish i had found them in an a larger size perhaps with a lever back that would have been more proportionate to me,1
these shorts are made of a thicker slightly firmer cotton than some competing brands which i think is great because they dont ride up or cling uncomfortably they are just good shorts that can be used as outerwear rather than being relegated to wearing under a skirt the stitching looks like it was done with quality and everything seems overall like it is definitely going to last as long as my daughter is in this sizebr br they fit true to size and did not shrink or fade appreciably in the wash my daughter loves them,2
very very nice good quality priced right,2
very low quality gold plated gold peeled off see picture should check before even mailing very disappointed,0
town of the town,2
quality purchase this is medium weight winter jacket i purchased a small 52 125 pounds 34c it is a bit snug in the armpits so i probably would have trouble wearing a very have thick sweater under it watch the price i first bought it for 122 then it dropped to 84 they would not refund me the diff so actually returned and bought another i hope i dont have issues with the zipper columbia jackets my kids wore always ended with broken zippers will see how i get through the winter,0
love the colors but very large dots to busy,1
i like that the watch restarts on its own after it is set up setting it up takes a bit of work but thankfully it is self sufficient at restarting each day the reminder vibration and noise are just enough to be helpful but not too intrusive my biggest complaint is that we use for someone that is deafblind for eye drop reminders and normally synchronize with another device at 15 minutes intervals unfortunately it loses time every time it goes off so throughout the day it loses about 10 minutes,2
my 16 year old wanted this bag for a long time so happy we were able to get it ive used it a few times too with the matching wallet it makes a super cute combo,2
cute and easy blazer to wear with jeans sadly the button fell off the first time i wore itso not well made wrinkles easy great cut and length but second rate quality,0
deft go one size bigger color changes as it stretches,1
not a huge fan of these they are very soft almost too soft seem well made but fall apart pretty easily if you actually work for a living had a problem with them riding up my legs with heavy activity probably wont purchase more,1
not bad material is nice but if youre under 58 the pants are going to be very high waisted,1
i am 43 5 foot 4 inches 136 lbs and athletic build this suit is cute i nanny children and we swim often i needed a kiddo friendly suit i was worried it would be a bit too sexy but its not i has more of a cute feel also i have a tiny belly and it totally makes it disappear it is not too long not sure why people are saying that it literally fits perfectly i love it i am buying another one so when this one is wearing out i have a back up,2
didnt work,0
i like the size of these lenses but both pair i ordered have broken where the ear piece attaches and are not repairable to bad,1
cute but big,1
based on the picture and description i was expecting full panel stretch but it just has an elastic band at the top part of the wait band and i just cannot handle the way that feels returned,0
i already have big shoulders and this jacket is a little out of control hopefully it breaks in a bit and doesnt look like a i am wearing football pads,1
this is a great suitcase super lightweight i like how half of the inside can be zipped up and it breaks the suitcase into two parts we put dirty clothes in one side and clean in the other for easy unpacking weve only flown with it once but so far so good,2
comfortable and warm when temperature stays above 40f i use heat patches when it gets below pretty large on the feet which is good in winter for using big socks not very durable however i had to reglue one sole after 8 months past a year both are leaking and i had to trash them,1
videoid632feda17749388965f85bccd6dd557e im heartbroken i opened the package about a week and a half ago and immediately fell in love with the dress as i now pack for vacation i noticed it has 2 small holes on one of the sleeves as i inspect the dress more carefully it looks like someone else had used it before the dress is beautiful and light material perfect for my vacation in mexico except its used and ripped otherwise this purchase would have been a 5 star,1
got this for my 6 year old who loves the schuyler sisters lol she loves the shirt and it fit perfectly good quality and the picture on front is just as shown,2
this is a nice t shirt it is made is quality material,2
even though its said waterproof i worried that after hours of snow play it would get wet especially after reading some of the other reviews my 7 year old rolled in the snow from 10am to 5pm although his gloves seemed wet they were nice and cozy i stuffed my hand in to check,2
i ordered a size bigger then normal and my toes were pushing right up against the toe of the slippers,1
i liked the fit through the body of this dress the fabric was thick enough to hold me in but i ended up returning it because the top was weird the sleeves didnt stay where they were supposed to so i felt like it was just going to keep falling down im large chested 34ddd at vs but somehow the bust was still too large when i tried to pull the sleeves up then it was just too tight in the arm area,0
prosbr stretchybr looks expensive even though its notbr comfortablebr br consbr sometimes the belt comes unhooked since its elastic it may spring off i ordered a size larger so the belt wasnt too smallbr br overallbr worth the money its a good buy,2
fits and looks great but is not made very well,1
the seller photo shows a crossover seam lower than the arm holes the actual crossover seam is much higher the center seam is also unfinished down the front from the crossover what this translated to was the crossover riding on top of my boobs forcing the pleat to pull open looking like an illfitted shirt that i hastily pinned across in addition to the shoulder pleating being closer to the neck it makes the material bunch up around the decolletage instead of pleat apart across the chest shame because the material is nice its well constructed and color is true to the online photo despite my indoor lighting if it had been sewn like the photo it would have lain beautifully across my bust i have a 20 yr old shirt in the same style and it is amazing these small details done right would have complimented any chest size i think this will only hang right if you oversize so its loose or if you are relatively flat chested,1
somewhat small and feels like silicone sticky feeling,1
cheap quality,0
dont buy not the real stuff inferior product,0
right lens is loose i can feel it move at the top and sides to fix it i would have to take it to a sunglass hut to have the plastic frame heated to hug the lens tighterbr br i have ordered before with no problems with these same sunglasses,1
first of all this dress is really cute its a good dress for the price that being said i had to return it because the waist is about 2 too high fell just below my bra everything else was great if the waist was lower id buy 3 good luck,2
i saw this necklace and thought it was so darling i got it for my granddaughter in the green and yellow i looked at the reviews and saw the pictures that people had taken and i felt confident in buying one well it came and i was beyond disappointed the pops of enamled color that make it stand out so well was almost completely absent from the one i got if you really look you can see a slight bit of green but the yellow and red are pretty much not there i dont know if the one i got somehow got left out of part of the coloring process i was just sad it wasnt beautiful like the picture shows its still a cute necklace and she liked it but then she hadnt seen the online picture of what it was supposed to look like i cant really recommend this one since i dont know how likely it is for someone else to get one that seems to be only partially painted too bad because it could have been so much cuter,1
very cute but the size that was recommended was incorrect,1
these rings are so pretty i especially love the x shaped one the cz is fun and sparkly and the rose gold is on trend they were comfortable and didnt feel or look too cheap i love that you can also wear them together or separately they fit true to size and i will definitely wear them often,2
the light weight is really great however this line of luggage has serious quality issues on the very first trip i took with this luggage the 26inch suitcase in the set broke the zipper on the external pocket before i even started my trip home there was almost nothing in the pocket just 2 magazines the zipper broke when i was opening the compartment to add a third magazine to it,0
the material was a cheap shiney material but the cut was cute however the seams were not good and a white seam on a black section at my bust line makes it unwearable for me not good quality,0
pretty thank you,1
it broke the first time my son wore it,0
i ordered a xxl it fit like a small and no way would it be discrete also very thin cheap material so disappointed i am returning,0
not durable falls apart quickly but i guess thats the point if these last forever wed never buy new ones,1
my son absolutely loves it,2
i have ordered 4 pair of sunglasses from here and all of them are amazing,2
works great thanks,2
this is a very good quality carryon suitcase the bright white color stands out it looks sophisticated and elegant the hardshell plastic case appears sturdy and up to par to handle the rigors of travelbr br this suitcase favors very well against more expensive competition another bag i purchased from a directtoconsumer retailer has a few more interior features and a slightly different exterior finish but excluding those small differences this suitcase is just as good as the more expensive one this suitcase represents a really good value in the zipperless luggage marketbr br plusesbr 1 white color looks clean elegantbr 2 aluminum hinges on back of suitcasebr 3 tsa approved security latches up front those these are plasticbr 4 no zippersbr 5 silent wheelsbr 6 telescopic handle has 3 positionsbr 7 compression straps hold clothing in placebr 8 aluminum frame and corner edge protectorsbr 9 nicely weighted carry handlebr 10 very good fit finishbr br minusesbr 1 telescopic handle has some flexing when fully extendedbr 2 aluminum scratches easilybr 3 tsa lock latch is plasticbr 4 not very many zippered compartments for smaller itemsbr 5 compression strap may not be big enough to contain all items placed on its side,2
moon and back is an amazonowned brand one of many amazonowned brands if youre familiar with moon and back you know how incredible soft their items are they are made from 100 organic cotton these are sleeper gowns so there are no legs and its open at the bottom with elastic super easy for diaper changing there are two of these in a set so at the current price of over twentyone bucks for made in egypt they are crazy expensive for what they are but again they are incredibly soft and i really like them,2
top was alittle shorter than i expected and it is also somewhat see through will have to wear another tank underneath it just to wear it other than that it fits alittle snug and the color is vibrate just wish the material wasnt thin kind of afraid to wash it because it may shrink,1
love the look the support and the way they are built,2
the shirts fit great,2
great fiti have purchased so far 5 different jeans signature by levis and this 541 34athletic fit34 from levis it seems the athletic fit are actually a perfect fit for methe waist is true 36 and there is enough room in the buttocks and thighs without being 34relaxed34 it narrows down at the ankles as well a little bigger than a slim fiti just love the looks and the comfort of them,2
super nice,2
it fits fine however when i wear it i sound like a trash bag every movement can be heard the outside material feels cheap,0
love the pockets and its so cute,2
the picture shows a jewelry box much bigger than what i got maybe i should have taken any measurements the ad showed and laid it out with pieces of paper if i had and the size was shown that i received i would not have ordered it,1
what professional wants to walk around the office with shoes that makes noice with each step,1
it doesnt fit exactly how id expect for a custom fitting shirt,2
i like it for emergency can put in small bag,2
i love these pants they have a little stretch to them and they are so comfortable they wash very well too true to size,2
poor quality,0
i love this ring i never take it off really cute and very nice quality,2
this pajama set is very smooth and soft but it runs very large in size i ordered 2x for my husband as thats the size hes been wearing in shirts lately its very big on him a large would have fit him much better the shirt has some fraying in parts of it where some loose string was coming out so quality could be improved no sure how many washes it will make it through,0
great jacket just a bit small,2
these shoes fit fairly well the heel was a good height the color was true to the picture shown they were ordered last minute to go with a dress for a formal event considering i do not wear heels very often i was able to wear them comfortably for several hours wellmade product,2
it was a gift so i do t know what it cost i like it and was surprised to receive something with gaga on it wish is was gold,1
i ordered size 3xl the bottom is perfect the top is at least an entire size smaller,1
fashionable,2
the sunglasses rims were in poor condition and some of the metal was bent the lens are no where near red avoid,0
im a big man looking that was looking for a particular fit around my groin this didnt fit the bill if youre not in prime condition at a movie stars body then i dont recommend,1
so pretty,2
the frames arent normal plastic theyre some sort of matte finish didnt really like em,0
it is extremely small i am usually a m or l and ordered a m but it was a probably a xs,0
meh straps are super thin if my chest was any larger it would be falling out of the bottom of this no under wire or anything to keep your girls in im a 34b,1
probably the best part of the glasses is the springed hinge it makes them comfortable to wear and i dont have to worry about them snapping when taking them on and off the logo on the sides is actually etched or machined in instead of burned on so it doesnt stand out too much lenses are definitely polarised it is not a very dark lens but still comfortable to see on a bright sunny day would recommend,2
returned,0
the pants are excellent they fit well and arent boxy like most chinos one word of caution i ordered two pairs both labeled online as slim tapered but one pair was a pleated straight fit not tapered at all luckily returns are pretty easy,2
my brotherinlaw loves them,2
this is a good price for curved barbells dont expect the kind of quality youd find at a body jewelry store the stones are cheap light plastic unless someone is right up close they wont notice the white marbled on was the biggest failure for me as it was basically all white with a touch of grey on the edge in a tiny spot otherwise they look a lot like the picture at least one did irritate my skin but the others seemed fine,1
got it for wedding as part of a trick the groom at 1st look it was larger than expected but didnt come with the tie to tie back,0
it was my fault i should have gotten a bigger sizebr that size i got would fit a doll it was soft great price fast shipping,1
perfect purse im picky my opinion this purse is about medium size with the prefect size zipper pockets fits my iphone 8 wlifeproof case easily with plenty of room for more items material is soft which i love its light in weight i have back injuries the strap is plenty long enough easy to move the strap adjuster up down i can fit my sunglasses in the side elastic pocket i over stuffed my purse it still has a slim look feel made with great quality i will definitely be buying more,2
this swimsuit fits a little small but it was 3 days before i would even try it on it came inside an obvious reused zipped bag with not only scratched off stickers but also conflicting ones one said medium one said extra large once opened the attached cardboard type tag said medium and the one sewn inside said xl i do like the suit and the fit although slightly runs small the suit i recommend but who ever does quality control for this company needs some serious retraining this two stars removoved the used bag makes a new suit seem used before examination,1
kind of flimsy,1
small near shoulders and upper arms,1
thats all i need to say just awesome,2
very cheap it works to add fluff to a dress but i doubt it will last not great quality in the least,0
bottom fit but top is somewhat small not for busty people,1
love love love this robe its soft light and warm hubby suggested i get another and i willbr br i just purchased this robe in pink and ivory the purple one worked out so great got 2 more they wash up without pulling out of shape great robe,2
stimulating bed time treatbr men can use this as a silky pant liner too in cool and cold weather they add a layer of warmth and in warmer weather they prevent chafing from blue jeans and rough fabrics stimulating silk feels great in bed for a happy fellow the slippery fabric stretches with you and caresses you all night stimulating fabric stands up to movement and slides over you so nicely perfect for sleep or play and stains wash right out follow washing instructions carefully as some body fluids may stain the front of these panties excessive rubbing may fray the silk,1
too small couldnt reorder as not good selection in my size really liked the product perhaps at a later date can check for size,1
very soft material but it was like wearing a sack im 5834 160lbs and usually wear an 8 or 10 if i had thought it would be more flattering i would have exchanged it for a small but the style was very unflattering,1
this is not as large as one of those aluminum wallet things and is basically a very dinky and flimsy sleeve with a lid it will serve well enough as my vehicle backup which i bought it for but for the money not very impressive,1
the cross over latch is a bit snug but may stretch as i wear them very cute shoes,2
i had bought 4 of these for my bridesmaids 2 of thrm are missing jewels in the necklace and earrings returning immediately,0
great christmas gift for my granddaughter according to my daughter my granddaughter wears them daily,2
good product,0
these blue laces complement my green converse perfectly,2
good length pair with shorter necklaces looks good only thing i didnt like about it is that it looks a little cheap not like real gold,1
its a nice design but poor quality fabric very thin especially for the price i would recommend finding yourself a better quality skirt,1
cute bra but runs really small in the cup i have bigger boobs 32 ddd and was surprised to see this brand had a bra in my size too good to be true though band fit decently but cups were beyond inadequate lol but im sure its a great bra for those it fits,1
i wore these for pittsburgh winters ive had them for a season and they are really nice to wear and they look cute in an odd kind of way really hardy shoes,2
this halo skull cap has a heavy neoprene band running around the rim that is both too tight and too tall the band covers my ears and presses quite hard on my ear plugs resulting in a rather loud ride seams are on the outside instead of being flat and while the neoprene band is rigid the white top portion isnt putting on my helmet either pulls the halo down too far or tries crunching the tips of my ears between helmet and seam neither one being terribly comfortable the yellow rubber sweat stripe leaves a lovely divot in my forehead so i tend to wear this thing backwards for reference i wear a large shoei fullface helmet and a 75 hatbr br locating a motorcycle helmet liner is rather a goldilocks problem ive come close a few times but havent located that 34just right34 item yet sweatvac makes or used to a nice ventilated cap that worked perfectly under a fullface helmet ear tips werent squished or pulled hard and it doesnt hit ear plugs resulting in a deafening experience finding them is getting to be tougher though zan had a little coolmax cap that worked okay but stretched easily and needed frequent replacement ah well ill keep trying different caps and seeing what works,1
these are basic white undershirts the fabric is thin but soft and stretchy they are true to size but tend to conform to the body if you prefer a roomier fig size up not a fashion statement these are standard decently constructed undershirts,2
bunched up handkerchiefs are a annoyance i have always washed my cotton handkerchiefs with bleach on the normal cycle now i am washing on cold and not using the dryer i bought these and a set of 13 while bamboo cotton blend they both work much better than plain cotton i will give the while ones 5 stars because the price worked out to a bit less than 2 each these are a bit more than 7 each cut that price in half and they would get 5 stars as well,1
i would give these negative stars if i could please do not waste your money if you desire cotton camis these are absolutely not cotton i buy items to tie dye and these were advertised as 95 cotton they held absolutely zero dye even items that are 60 cotton hold dye well these are falsely advertised as cotton and very cheaply made spandex,0
i love the earrings and they got here very quick thanks,2
im 52 and 112 pounds and as much as i wanted it to fit it was just too loose the hubby took a look and said uh uh while shaking his head vigorously back and forth unfortunate its too cute,0
i bought this for a wedding its super cute and the material is great the bottom is thick and that seethrough i usually order xl in dresses because i have a large chest some reviews suggested a size up and glad i did cute dress for the price and has pockets,2
as soon as i received this package i tried this on at home and then i spent like an hour to clean off the lints from this sweater i tried to clean all the loose lints from the sweater but in vain,0
i work at a grocery store and i wear these shoes and they are super comfortable,2
little short and the seam in the front makes it lay a little weird but still cute,1
this soft little hat and gloves is perfect for my son the quality is great and it will be perfect for keeping him warm,2
pretty but you have to bend the metal to put it on and try to bend it symmetrically the sides and back are elastic with a snap at the back which looks weird and cheap if not covered by a jacket or something,1
but the color is a beautiful orange and they look good she will grow into them,2
great quality cheaper than the stores,2
i was excited to find polarized frames that fit since i need very small frames for my face loved color style and comfort i was going to order another color bought 4 months ago kept in nice holder with snap when not wearing last month i noticed edge of left lens changing color like it was separating like my iphone screensaver pulls away when air gets under it from crack anyway now almost all of each lens is doing the same wont be getting another pair for sure i never dropped these except in my lap in car seat tried to get good pic of lensnever got a scratch on them,0
color way off,0
i love this product from the way it looks works the storage bag it comes witheverything i used it to stretch a pair of shoes the first night i got it and it works well,2
just not very classy i dont care for the fabric not a true red but is as shown,1
these shoes are so comfortable the soles are nice and thick and cushybr i love that you can just slip them on and gobr i recommend these highly,2
i disregarded the opinion of others regarding these shoulder pads should have listen these things do not stay up total waste of money,0
nicely made was very impressed hope my brother likes it,2
great boot jack,2
if i could give no stars i would awful quality i have wore 8 out of the 12 pairs and every single pair either have a hole after 8 hours of wearing with dress shoes or they tear dye to poor quality i should be paid to wear these rather than paying to wear them awful purchase awful quality save time and money and dont buy this product,0
returned cheap,0
fast delivery band is same quality that comes as uggs bought elsewhere great value for a great product nice and comfy,2
poor quality once washed shrink smallerbr xl fits like a small,0
love it,2
i used it as a coffin for my bird,2
stumbled on this belt via a golf link read up on it then immediately bought 3 belts this version white color and one for business dressbr br received them on time in perfect package condition and was in love at first sight when openedbr br the overall material quality is very high leather is nice and thick buckle is solid the mechanism works perfectly my wife now wants to order some for herselfbr br i wish that nexbelt would sell additional leather belts only without straps as i like this buckle and would like to use it with other colorsbr br now i am facing a problem of what to do with all of the golf belts i have been collecting as i dont think i will ever wear them again,2
i like these pants they fit as i expected them to fit,1
arrived as promised i was so excited to receive this sweater however the lace around the neck is itchy and its very sheer i returned it,1
big and bulky and the material just felt scratchy and yuck,0
se rompio el primer dia,0
nice to look at but it feels like polyester,0
im just under 6 and 155lbs and got the black in a large and while the legs were a decent length it was not long enough at all the body is far too short if you know what i mean i then ordered the xl and its a tiny bit more forgiving but i actually checked the tag because it seems like almost the same size im going to see if my grandma can somehow make the straps longer on the xl so it can give me another inch of body and hopefully not have it so far up because i really love it and want it to work so bad,1
my 13 year old daughter bought these with her own money she was so completely pleased with these her friend ordered a7pk of leggings in a diiferent brand and these were much nicer super soft yet theres a very slight sheen to them which makes them look like athletic leggings instead of just leggings if that makes any sense it was a big deal to her even the black is not see thru at all thinking about ordering a set for myselfbr br she is 52 115lbs very athletic build the smmed fits her nicely,2
these shirts sublimate perfectly but run super narrow and long i wont buy any more unless the sizing is corrected they arent useable the way they are except for scraps to test on,0
i wear a us size 12 bra size about 38c the boobs were extremely tight it also had a small stain and does not stretch at all you cant tell in the photos but the designs are sligthly different on the chest area,0
i ended up giving it to my niece the chest fit small on me and i am not large in that area it was pretty and she love sit,1
this isnt true too size the sweatshirt is very cute and the color is vibrant but its smaller at the top and looks stretched at the bottom,1
bien,2
xxl but still fits tight i normally feel comfortable in 1x sizes,1
some size coats are the right size some art every company different it was a nice coat i just wish it fit,0
small,1
i was very happy and proud to buy an american made product and im also very happy to report that i was not disappointed in my decision this american flag pin greatly exceeded even my high expectations in both the quality and the artistic beauty of the product keep up the good work and thank you for a great american made product,2
already has a hole ripped in it near the pocket,0
i bought a hat just like this one in cozumel mexicofor much cheaper i might add about 4 years ago i had skin cancer on my face so this hat along with a ton of sunscreen works well to keep my face protected from the sun i like how it fits comfortably around the back of my head and most of the time even a strong wind cant blow it off,2
not as shiny after a couple of days but its still cute,1
this is a great satchel to carry everything you need it is beautiful i love all the colors its light to carryunless you put too much in it,2
these are cheaply made but better than dollar store flip flops i bought them for the shower at the gym i ordered a size larger because of the reviews and am glad i did they had a heavy plastic like smell when they came i left them outside overnight and it resolved that issue,2
it runs small i usually use size medium and it didnt fit right a bit snug and as you can see thats not the style of the dress,1
very beautiful and looks just like the picture,2
16 is small,1
the vneck was cut too low had to return it material had a nice amount of stretch to it but i didnt want to layer another cami underneath,1
bag is attractive but the 2 front pockets are sub optimal for storage the design of the baggallini hanover is great this one is awkward,1
i didnt see him wear these so done know,1
bought this for my fiancé he loves it,2
these earrings should be labeled as childrens size so beware they are so small and i got them as a gift for an adult woman i shouldve known since it does say 4mm,0
should have been longer for the waistline,0
this was perfect for half marathon in light rain,2
i received a beautiful box but no bracelet just and empty box,0
did not come with battery does not get that warm either,0
ive worn other under armour sport bras and expected the same fit not,1
the way the dress looks in the picture made it seem like it was going to be long but the dress was above my ankles im 57 and got a largebr i new the medium would fit me better but i was worried about the lengthbr i was a little disappointed,0
cheap tarnished in less than 2 months dont waste your money,0
the print is backwards if that wasnt done wrong it would have been perfect,0
this shirt is just ok the quality is good but it fits a little boxy and the color said khaki when it is really more of a blush pink,1
cute shirt but fits small and in weird spots,1
i love this necklace it is well worth the money i have another aromatherapy necklace but this one is my go to i wear it almost daily well constructed perfect size and attractive with any outfit my only sadness is that i misplaced the glow ball inserts great item great seller i would definitely buy again,2
its a pretty dress just not what i was looking for smaller than what i expected and the blue hues are brighter than they look in the picture,1
the shoes are huge even ordering a smaller size didnt help beware,0
like the style and feel but shoes is small ordered a 12 and got 115,0
its okay,1
if i would have known before purchasing that it would take 21 days to deliver i wouldnt have purchased and being from china it fits too snug to my head,1
love love this hat perfect style and wide brim to cover face,2
the side pockets cannot be locked only the large main opening making it a little inconvenient for air travelbr it is bigger than i expected but comfortably holds more than enough clothing that weighted under the airline limit,1
looks junkie feels hunky,0
colors were beautiful brought in the teal and rustbr material was softbr br fit i wonder if this wasnt made for man vs womanbr br the chest felt right but the shoulder seam came down to the upper portion of my arms and the arm length way past my fingertipsbr br sent back both,1
very nice very heavy fabric i went one size up from my regular as suggested but i really needed to go 2 sizes up not as high waisted as i like,2
they are beautiful and comfortable but we will need at least 2 sizes bigger bc with one was too small and didnt fit it has a lot of fur inside that makes it tight,2
just received these clipon sun shades for my frameless prescription glasses the delivery was very fast and the packaging protected the sunglasses it came with the microfiber cleaning cloth and a cute little card to prove that these are truly polaroid lenses without wearing the glasses you see nothing on the road but viewed through the glasses you see cars you can also test polaroids against another polaroid lenses by turning the two lenses in opposite directions if they are both polarizing lenses you will reach a point where no light can pass though both lenses due to each lens only allowing light waves to pass in one direction when the two paths cancel each other no light can pass throughbr anyway back to the review these are very light weight so wearing them for extended periods should be quite comfortable the appearance is just like the photographs above my only difficulty is that the frameless prescription lenses are attached to the nosepiece bridge exactly at the same point as the clip on legs clip on so attaching them to my glasses requires a bit of fiddling to get them placed so that they dont pop off when flipping the shades up other than that they seem well made i dont wear sunshades regularly so i will try to update this review after a few months to see how they hold up,1
its a great well built watch the only problem is that it doesnt keep time and what good is a watch that wont keep time,0
pleasantly surprised with this purchase not too thin like some of the stuff today and not sweaterthick 61 and 205 lbs and xl was perfect for me a touch big just like i like it,2
very cute but it is exactly the same as the drogon keychain i had except for the paint,1
fits fairly loose at sleeves and waist cute but kinda loose,1
dress was way too tight definitely size up once or twice the cape of course was great,0
nice but heavy at first,2
awesome looks so im keeping even though the fit is not that great,2
i thought id give it a try and it failed ill seldom wear it but ya never know i may just give it to a friend,0
fitbr this bra fit as expected ordered the 36f and felt true to sizebr br fabricmaterialsbr the fabric does hold up after washing and the same goes with the hooks on the back the material is not soft and does not soften with washing the material just seemed very stiff which helped keep the cup shape fabric is why i probably wouldnt buy again since its uncomfortable the top 34sling34 portion of the bra was awkward it often came very high up above the folddown cup requiring a very high necked shirt otherwise it would showbr br claspbr this bra did have easy onehanded clasps to use for breastfeeding these did unclasp on their own occasionally but not enough to make this a real issue and the easy to unclip outweighed its occasional malfunctionbr br thank you for reading my review please let me know if you found this review helpful by clicking the helpful button below thank you,1
nice design but the small fits like an extra small,1
medium is huge looks comical on me and i own 2 other levi medium trucker jackets keep that in mind if you are normally a medium,0
i understand that 32 bucks are not much for this but to brock in two weeks i can not even ship back because it s gonna cost me the same amount of money so dissapointed,0
watch loses 5 min a day cannot set date ill be returning i remember when timex could take a licking and still be ticking must have mfg in china,0
i love my new baggallini crossbody bag works terrific changed over to this type of bag with the pandemic everything you really need at your finger tips love the secret easy compartment for phone etc,2
great wallet for the simple man,2
these boots are very impressive waterproof and warm for those snowy daysbr price is great so cant complain about thatbr purchased gray color and they are adorable on my toddler these boots are worth checking out,2
dont waste your this is horrible quality i cant believe i paid that amount for a damn 5 dollar tshirt,0
bought for my daughter and so sad it turned horrible do not buy,0
item was used for a mad max costume and was as described it does has that cheap plastic smell that fades with time,2
these shirts were for under my scrub tops they are not a thick bulky shirt the material is perfect for layering as its soft and thin just enough to add some warmth in the colder months,2
this is a lovely dress it is good for a special occasion i liked it i thought it was flattering i thought the fit was pretty good i thought that it was unique and looked goodbr br the dress was relatively comfortable the fit was okay it wasnt too hot which for me is important since we live in floridabr br it felt durable and the fabric was relatively softbr br it was as described and i would recommend it,2
not much to it but will serve the purposefits just fine,1
i dislike the fabric but the color was very nice no stretch,0
expedition weight has been my goto for many years super warm as base layer under regular clothing on cold days or for outdoor sporting activities when ive hiked snowboarded gone ice fishing i wear under northface boarding pants and they keep me warm i get cold easily and these work wonders to keep me warm they also fit closr to the skin similar to a pair of leggings so they go well under dress slacks jeans even skinny stretch jeans ive warn them under and as base layer under several layers for outdoor sporting activities,2
i wear a 10 mens a 10 for this shoe equates to a size 9 cheap shoes but colorful,1
labeled as xl more like xxs,0
i got this in the mail today after waiting forever i had ordered this so long ago that i had forgotten about it until todaybr br some things im not happy about when it comes to this walletbr br there is no space for change at all maybe a penny or two if your luckybr you have to fold up your cash to fit it in the wallet and you cant really fit a lot of it inbr there is only room for two cards per slot and absolutely nothing biggerbr br now this wallet is fine for someone like me who doesnt often carry cash and has a lot of cards but its not good for much else,1
edit to add my new review so its been 3 months since my review ive completely changed my mind about these shoes i would not recommend them they do not hold up my sons have basically fallen apartbr br purchased this for our kindergartner for back to school they fit him perfectly with a little bit of room to grow i love that they are a neutral color will match well with his uniforms he says they are comfy likes the look overall this is something we would buy again,0
the reason i gave this three stars is because it came to me obviously used there were no tags on it it came stuffed in a zip lock baggie and im not happy about itbr br the blouse itself is cute but i didnt go to a garage sale i paid a good price for this and it should have been newbr br ive decided to wash it and keep it because i dont wanna deal with returning it reorderingbr br because of the way im built on top i have to have a bigger top even tho im a smaller person i can tell it will fitbr br amazon better get it together and stop sending used things,1
i typically wear a size 2x or 2022 and im apple shaped size 4244 dd or e i ordered the 5x if i raise my arms and this is untucked you definitely see the bottom of my brabr br what is actually more of an issue however is that the purple is not the solid royal purple in the photos it is a much lighter heathered fabric not the look i was going for as it is much more casual,1
i got it today and im wearing it now i love the the style and i get a lot of compliments this is the second one of this style i have own,2
i got this product to wear under a wig all part of my costume but the wig cap would not stay on my head it seemed to be too small for my head but it was labeled as onesizefitsall so i thought it would work,0
it is a beautiful tribute to your gone but forgotten cat my daughter wears this bracelet constantly and the bracelet is very durable and it has not changed color due to poor metals,2
even better in person its silky smooth and so feminine i couldnt be happier i wear a 20 and a 2xl fit great i also have a long torso and it was slightly short but i am tucking it into a high waist so its perfect for the look on the model i do want to caution the tie is attached,2
it does not look like the picture material cheap,0
great swim shorts for triathlon and other swim event training,2
these jeans are seriously amazing i was skeptical but these are going to be my go to jeans from now on they are softer than most jeans but the fit an quality is shockingly good at this price point,2
my watch wouldnt stay in the bracket else it would of been super great,0
it was a mite small,1
i like this shoe but i was sent the wrong size i didnt reorder because the heel was a bit too much for me personally i like under 334 and the shoe wasnt as comfy as id expect,1
bought these for my 13 year old son they lasted less than 3 weeks before there were holes in both shoes i would never ever buy these again,0
the jeans are very soft and stretchy which is nice my issue is im 510 and got an 8long but they are still too short,1
the same basic style was better before the previous style did have its flaws as there was usually one pair in every package where the elastic would come loose on the top edge so maybe thats why they were changed but this new style is far less comfortable because the top elastic is thicker and less stretchy,1
not as thick as i like them,0
i always wore keds years ago i liked the style but was hoping for more of an arch but they are comfortable but not to wear for extending walks,2
the mask is well made which is why its disappointing that the eyes are so dark and there are no air holes also the bands to secure the mask around your head are very tight on my 13 year old son and cant be adjusted saw another review about the lenses being loose this was the same with ours but easily glued back in,1
nice hat fits nice,2
too thin easily gets snagged poorly sewn its already in my rag pile i do not recommend,0
the color and material was of good quality however the large was very long by the croch area im 59,1
very comfortable,2
love this top so adorable and cute but after wearing it two times the string around the button broke not a huge deali just wish i couldve worn it a few more times,2
i had high hopes for these glasses but they were a dud so wide and arms so loose they literally fell off my face when i put them on maybe they will work for someone with a wider head its too bad because they were very light and looked fabulous,0
i got this because i do love cubanstyle necklaces and wristbands and i rarely see a lot of silverstainless steel ones that offer to fit my neck sizebr br however after getting it out of the box it was clear this necklace was not the 24 inches as advertised it almost feels like a choker around my neck in fact i couldnt even make it go all the way around to even close the clasp pretty sure this was meant for someone with a smaller neck diameter otherwise it does have a good look and great finish very shinybr br will recommend this if you are a smaller person but larger people with a neck size over 26 inches probably wont find this a good fit,1
these shoes look super cute however i ended up returning because size chart was way off by a full size says 6534 length would be a size 9 compared to most charts that say it would be equivalent to a size 10 so i followed their chart thinking they would know what theyre selling that didnt turn out so wellwe needed something quick for my son so we had no time to exchange and ended up with a different brand also i was told this brand is good for wide feetnot so sure about that yes the toe bed was wide on this style but narrower than i was expecting for the rest of the shoe,0
actually i never got a chance to use them when i was in alaska in january no one would let me on the ice covered walks cant blame themmy balance was not the greatest at the time but maybe i will use them in the future or one of my grandchildren will,1
cute design but awful material,0
the earrings are very pretty and i would have really loved to keep them but unfortunately they came in a terrible condition the posts were bent so much that i could almost see the post falling off from the stud and the surfaces were also scratcheddented so that i could see the silver coating peeling off,0
the dots on the footbed massage your feet constantly and ensure your feet breathe without sticking please nike please bring back the solay for women too im,2
cute shirt but is is see through and would need to wear a strapless bra,0
fit a little bit small but it was great quality looked so cute on our baby,2
my boys thought this was a magician outfit were going to a ball and didnt like the way it looked returned and received the spring notion tux without the tail,0
not what i expected,1
average,1
theyre kind of puffy so if youre curvy at all move on theyre comfy and roomy just a little too puffy in shape they work well for working out but there are more flattering shorts out there if you care to look good while working out,1
tal como lo esperaba,2
these are cute socks but they are not true to size im shoe size 9 and they are simply to small im disappointed because i do like them,1
i originally ordered a different dc shoe in 7 12 it was a bit too large so replaced it with the 7 in bright white and it fits well sometimes i hesitate to wear these as they are a very brilliant white i like that but they are very attention getting they are quite comfortable and the thicker sole seems to step well taking a bit of getting used to during the break in period because i wear them very occasionally i cant comment on their durability so look at other reviews as this could be a consideration in this lace glue constructionbr br these shoes would be a frugal buy at 3500 i paid 5000,2
the band did not hold up it broke about a week after i got it since the band is proprietary i would have to buy a whole new watch,0
muy bonitos y facil de poner,2
the size is much smaller than expected it looks like its built for a prepubescent female,0
for the money its ok but it feels very cheaply made,0
cute shorts however i ordered a small and a small came in except it was three sizes at least to big will be returning,0
i am a size 8 and ordered the biggest size it is soooooo tiny would fit a child,0
i ordered a smaller size per the other reviews and this was huge on me and the fabric was itchy even after washing what a waste,0
didnt like the fit was wider and not as soft as they say a bit snug in the back,1
my credit cards,2
the headline says all good material ridiculous see through design i cant wear this in the summer,0
we consulted the size chart which suggested we might need to size up to a small but stayed with xs the xs was too big sizing was just weird its fine otherwise nothing fancy but a decent cheaply made jumpsuit,1
stylish show good for going out but your feet will be cold,2
i got this as a gift it didnt fit a man well,0
these socks run so tight in the ankle i could not even get my foot in them they are soft and feel nice but no good unless you have small feet im a size 9 my daughter size 3 got them instead and they fit her not too big,0
gave it as a gift the recipient seemed to like it it is not the best quality but i guess one is buying it for the i love lucy image i feel for what i got it was a tad over priced,1
great comfortable great quality for the price looks good pro style fit,2
stretched out of shape too soon,0
i love the fact that its not see through at all very nice material i just feel like the way it comes down on my shoulders is a bit off but its something i guess i can grow to love if you have a mommy pouch get good shapewear because it will show or just stop drinking a week before to kill the bulge,1
this bracelet at least the one i received looks pretty much like what the picture looks like its a rose quartz stone set in a gold looking setting on a gold chain the stone looks more natural not shaped but set as it may be found in nature the chain doesnt seem to be of very high quality so it doesnt look all that great if you are wearing something on the nicer side the clasp is shaped like the letter s and is slightly tricky to get but once you do it seems to be pretty firmly in there the hard part is trying to slip it in without bending it or bending it too much because once you start bending it the little bit of metal will weaken once it breaks itll be a mess to get the bracelet to stay onbr if you like what you see in the picture and you really like it then you should like it however it does look a little on the lower end of the jewelry scale so keep that in mind i really like the rose quartz part of it its a very pretty stone its definitely the best things about this bracelet,1
i love these for the house no where close to being water shoe,0
i like the 2 inch wide straps they stay on your shoulders better and give better support i have 3 pair tan blue and black excellent choice and i recommend them,2
purchased for my son who is a freshman in high school quality wise he says they are ok his biggest con with these is the drawstring he wore them to school as he really liked how soft and comfortable they were that said he did have to tie the drawstring extremely tightly as they would fall down if he didnt while he was walking into one of his classes he said he had to step over something to get to his desk in the process of doing that he felt the drawstring snap and while he was lifting his foot up i believe over a chair his shorts fell all the way off of him to the point where it actually got caught with his flip flop he said he was mortifed as he was standing in class for almost 2 minutes in his underwear what made this worse is that when he went to pull the shorts back up the drawstring was stuck in the shorts and still tied somehow and he could barely get the shorts over his thighs he finally with his strength got the shorts back up on his waist but had to go the rest of the day holding his shorts up as he would have been wandering around in his red white and blue boxers that he had on that day,1
a warning these bras run very very small at least two possibly three sizes too small it fits very well around the back and its comfortable the problem is that the cups are way too small its a shame because the bra is super soft if you have a small cup sizeless than a full c cup these bras might work for you but do order a size or three up,0
im not a very big gal sure my hips dont lie but this was just ridiculously too small,0
these straps work well for most glasses unfortunately my package did not include any ear hooks so i am unable to use them on my tifosi dolomite or the julbo glacierbr my daughter has been using one now for some time and has no complaints fewer scuffs on her lenses since she doesnt just put the glasses in her purse all the timebr and yes they do floatbr br i did receive this item at a reduced cost for my unbiased and honest opinion,1
hurt after a while,1
these shirts run small but the mediums are large odd,1
i liked the softness and the design they were a little tight at the top but i turned them down and they were fine but the toe seam crosses over my toes and causes discomfort after only a couple of minutes in my shoes my current socks do not do this,1
great,2
just okay,1
the earrings are pretty to look at they are very light weight the problem im having is losing the earrings i lost both earring in one evening the clasps needs some work,0
so small even my 6 month old cannot wear them way too small even for a barbie,0
awful,0
very comfortable and the moisture wicking feature is great,1
this type of blouse should fit with room but this one was not true to size much too large,1
very comfortable but one of the pins keeps popping out of my watch i have a garmin vivoactive 3 music and it seems to only do this on one strap not sure if this was just machines improperly and too short or if theyre all made this waybr br its cheap but ive only used it about a week and it falls off every couple days not really worth the purchase but i already threw the packaging away ill be looking for a better inspectedbuilt set,0
i was sceptical on purchasing but so glad i did the shirt is so soft and comfortable i love it,2
it works,2
it works for a small kid but not if you carry very much,1
the outfit itself is cute i love the colors and the fit the material is a little scratchy but not so much it takes away the cuteness,2
this purse is literally falling apart after a few weeks use the strap came unattached and the lining is peeling off im so disappointed,0
it is cheap looks cheap made of really cheap material,0
these for perfectly and they are comfortable and light perfect for lounging around the house,2
when you have one of those days that the impossible seems to happen this is the perfect tie the colors are excellent and for the price the quality is very good fun to wear and nobody questions the meaning,2
honestly i would give these gloves no stars if i could they came in filthy packaging have a strong terrible odor to them and are not at all as pictured my hands still smell awful after trying them on they are described as a size medium but are extremely small my hand measures less than 6 34 inches in circumference at the base of my fingers size small and my hands barely fit into these gloves in addition they are not the soft green color pictured in the listing they are an atrocious neon chartreuse greenextremely ugly i do not recommend these gloves even for the price paid,0
too large cant size,0
so comfortable especially the ear hooks they are comfortable they dont tug your ears or feel constrained,2
i love this watch it is very expensive looking,2
these boots are awesome but they need to size them better,1
i liked the way it looked and felt but the sizing was way off i normally wear a large in most tops so ordered the large but it was way way too big more like a 2x did not even try the bottoms on so had to return do like the brushed inside feel and satin outside makes sleep so much better if you toss and turn,1
my husband was always coming in the house with his shoes on this created a lot of problems with tracking in dirt from the outside now that he can slide these crocs right on and off we are both happy i got him a size 12 but especially without socks they want to fall off he said he will keep them but next time i will go down a size his regular size is 11 like my crocs i am sure his will last forever,2
its a nice bag not a bad price but it came with scratches all over the front of it,0
item works as indicated however not acceptable to be worn on airplane during due to the vent holes not filtered,0
this set looks great on my wrists i get lots of compliments when i wear these and it goes with practically everything even jeans and a tshirt it dresses any outfit up,2
shirt material came apart literally after wearing it twice created small holes,0
perfect size not too small can fit everything i need inside quality is great,2
high quality leather fits my 725 inch wrist,2
super cute blouse after i took the shoulder pads out,2
earrings are very durable and secure i fell asleep by accident with them on and they didnt break like my plastic earrings,2
love these and have bought every color supportive enough for cardio and playing volleyballbr br im 55 215lbs and wear an xlbr br loveeeee these so much,2
one sleeve was longer than the other very noticeable,0
look really nice,2
band broke after a month of use and now i cant return because im outside of my return window,0
perfect fit like the cut and the material the multi colors will match a variety of pants,2
very small band around chest,0
poor quality,0
a little bit smaller than expected but its still a cute bag i gave it to my sister for her birthday its durable enough for school so far all her little friends are jealous so thats a plus,2
these are very cute earrings unique,2
wished the rockport shoes were made in usa id gladly pay more if they had been at leased they were made in bangladesh and not china i would not have bought the if made in china,2
seems like a well made bra but sizing is off tried my usual size and couldnt even hook in back comfortably also cups were small tried 2 more sizes one going up in band size and other going up in both band and cup size both were too big had to return all 3,1
the gg sign in the corner of the lens is real annoying i had to scratch it off eventually they say its polarized but i see no difference from regular plain sunglasses,0
no complaints fits perfect very satisfied i would buy again,2
picture was super cute but not my fav on myself idk i am picky tho good color,1
great shirt keeps color well and is a good weight,2
not even close to fitting very disappointing i will not buy from this company again,0
love suit didnt expect it to be as unfinished as it wasbr also came way to late,1
three babies late reply i still love these sleep nursing bras they are always my go to nursing bra for comfort when am first home with a new baby and for when i am pregnant and my chest is tender,2
love the looks of the watch but it does not live up to timex standards loses about 1 second per day sometimes 2 as others have said thats not good by todays standards more like something from the windup era,1
the pocket squares are nice enough i suppose the material is in line with the pricing i would say that half of the colors are something i dont every see myself ever wearing so in my opinion i would have been better off buying the squares in singles additionally they are all white squares with color lined edges so the look is nearly identical for each item,1
cheap gift but cutethe person i bought it for loves it it matches her scrubs,1
im 59 200 is i ordered a 2xl it fits perfect have already ordered more i was afraid it would be thin and see through this is not the case absolutely this dress recommended,2
love it,2
nice item good quality but white material had pink hue,1
material is a little too thin,1
way too small it said that it was true to size i am an xl and i could barely get my arms in it,0
very nice sweater sleeves were a tad short for my liking but will definitely wear,1
this sweater is nice and comfy the only problem is that i have had it a short time less than 2 months with not a lot of wear and the threads are starting to get loose and poke out,1
it was huge and very cheap material,0
awesome boots comfortable so far they seem like good quality i get a ton of compliments when i wear them,2
it doesnt attach,1
i received dirty very cheap feathers everywhere,1
unhappy with the quality and material this is not tie dye it is a print of something tie dye like all good hippies should step away,0
extremely comfortable but fall apart almost immediately sent for an exchange and it was gonna take 4 weeks and took 2 weeks to be refunded,0
these are good for splash pad pool area for quick use however they arent meant for lots of running and playing by rocks roads etc and can easily get worn out and your kid will fall in them if they use them like tennis shoes they have their place but they dont belong on playground or when your kids are running in the yard they are not supportive enough,1
product arrived missing stones so i had to return it other than that its super cute,1
the quality of these pants were awful i did not even get a chance to try them on because they were ripped down the middle of pants i am a size 4 and it fit around my waist well however they ripped as soon as i walked around,0
i liked the clip it was what i wanted,2
awesome fit great fabric,2
must be careful and carry extra pair because they will break if you take a long trip,0
fits great flattering comfortable,2
no robe rope that an essential part which makes it hard to use disappointing after waiting along time for it to arrive,0
great,2
i ordered this dress for an interview and it was perfect the dress fit very well,2
im 51034 the length was too short and at least 2 inches above my ankles the crotch area was extremely baggy and bunches up under a relaxed fit pair of jeanscalves were loose and above the knee was snug,0
entirely too small i normally have to get one size up in dickies34 but these are probably 2 sizes too small in a size 34 and i wear a size 32s in levis,0
great fit great feel nice aggressive sole very good stability quality seems high,2
too narrow,0
a little small,1
40 bucks to replace my cracked lens perfectly and 300 dollar glasses look new and work new,2
great quality but the size is too small i have a 4234 chest and ordered a 4434 chest and its still too small,1
leather is scorched there are scorched spots all over the bag bag dept dimensions are slightly smaller than described its just ok,1
they are way to thick you can totally tell that there fake plugs i was very unsatisfied with this product,0
would have been 5 stars if the light at the bottom didnt activate every time it gets bumped in my bag the light works well if you can keep that from happening really it just gets bumped and turns on and runs down the battery so its not available when you meet light otherwise a good umbrella,1
just horrible nothing like the picture its green and ugly i never saw green snake skin print in my life even the print is distorted and the material does not look like that in the picture,0
if not for the immediate wearing of the revlite outsole on the forefoot immediately under the ball of your foot id say these shoes are one of the most comfortable ive ever owned from day 1 no breaking in period but probably because im coming from nb 890v6sbr br however this is ridiculous for 100 pair of running shoes id expect not to have the outer sole material revlite visible damaged after 12 5mi runs on pavementbr br for comparison i had 890v6s for over a year and a half of running at least every other day i know too long and the treads were just wearing down to the midsole pretty good wearing lifebr br maybe its just an outer layer of the revlite material that sheds and then subsides but it seems pretty bad my shoes tend to wear smack in the middle of the ball of my foot so nothing off there either just excessive wear with barely any usebr br im estimating 34 months tops before the revlite pads are completely gone and im left with no outsolegrip on the forefoot maybe not but well seebr br update 71820 the blue material is now completely flattened after one month or 150 miles of runs no more grip terrible not sure what they were thinking but 1 month to donate these to goodwill is insane please fix in v9,0
item was see though couldnt wear to work,0
capacious divided handbag which i bought for plane trip not very satisfactory becausebr a the bag has a persistent fishy small which lingers even nowbr b metal clasp attaching shoulder strap broke catastrophically while i was standing in line at airport requiring some creative repair with a nylon cord from a conference id card the bag was not particularly heavy as most of my possessions were in another bag had wanted it to organise things so i could find them easilybr would have returned it but was too much trouble and needed it to continue my travels not recommended,1
very chic i get lot of compliments on it be cafe ful because it will snag easily,2
really like this suit fabric very comfortable however the length is very short returned for a refund,0
love the style and it is super cute sleeve length and overall size is a little smaller than expected would suggest ordering on size larger if you are on the larger end of a size material is nice and i love how the top can go with pants shorts or a skirt,2
this is not what i expected im new at this but it was not what im looking for too thin and smallbr oh well live and learn,0
good price for this boot,1
material is no stretch and dress was made for a child,0
it does give effect i was looking for but no other complaints,0
shirt is not true to size,0
the colors are different than pictured its not bright and colorful more subdued i will gift it to someone,1
runs about 23 sizes smaller than normal sizes,1
a,2
wrinkles too much too short cant tie it,0
they are a bit tight but what i dislike about them most is they are cheaply made the material started flaking off,0
very comfortable love the colors fits perfect,2
very cheap products will not be purchasing again,0
the shoes were too large the sizing said 859i wwould say they are a nine as my heel would slip out of them as i walked i know size 8 would have been too small i returned the shoes and will look for some that have the correct sizing not two sizes in one,0
i received the shirt i was going to give it to my sister for her birthday but unfortunately the right sleeve is sewn together and you cant put your arm through it i was so embarrassed i had nothing to give her for her birthday i would like a replacement or a refund please,0
this shirt is lightweight and comfortable its perfect for our florida weather,2
arrived broken replaced and broke flimsy and cheap in quality,0
this ring fits really well and is gorgeous,2
like the product all around use it for mixing essential oil cleaner with water nice color,2
i was expecting the style to be different the fabric is cotton and has no shape also very big,0
flattering on plus size size up is u have larger boobs,1
aside from the large fitting much like a small they are poorly madebr right out of the package and the side has a rip near the elastic elastic that will cut into your skin they are tight and undersizedbr please dont put your junk in these drawers they will not treat you kindly the front is lined as the rest is very thread bare feeling fit more like you accidently bought ladies undies real men wont like these i returned both packs my photos more clearly show what i mean,0
beautiful shoe cannot wear toe box is way too narrow shame,0
this waist trainer fits really well and fits true to size for me it is comfy to wear and easy to keep clean after i use it the velcro is strong and stays in place while i am using it i like that it goes on my thighs as well as my waist it helps me to sweat while exercising it is a good value for the quality and price,2
ordered a medium which is usual dress size im 5 135 lbs with d cup dress is too tight too short i returned and didnt order another but guessing an extra large wouldve fit,1
i would normally wear a 22 but need a 20 in these the material is thin but keeps its shape the waist is big in case youre thick in that area,2
dad loved his hat,2
good looking shire well made runs a little small wanted it loose and i order an extra large and it was tighht on me,2
these fit perfectly and cover all my aerola and nipple it doesnt allow my nipples to be shown even in the coldest weather they are reusable and can be stored and used again and again they arent uncomfortable and after putting them on you dont even realize they are still there besides the fact that your nipples arent showing anymore,2
does not fit right as you can see the ear end of the frame is not balanced one is touching the ground while other is not guess that is what you get with 10 dollars glass,0
the material was very light and seethrough i returned this product,0
excellent product actual 2nd time ordered just wanted extras,2
excellent qualitybr for hot weather nights almost too heavy,2
broke after 1 week now i cant wear it and im out the money,0
the skirt i received was definitely much longer than advertised folded over and hiked up like an empire waist it hits me below the knee im 5334 2 stars for soft material as i only bought this for labor folding it over a few times will look chunky but no big deal,0
so i ordered the product and i ordered it in large i washed it and when i took it out of the washing machine not sure if it trunk or not because i didnt really try it before usually size large thats what fits but it was way too tight so if you order order two sizes bigger dont order the size that you usually wear and it also comes from china so thatll tell you a lot i was not able to return it like i said i had washed it so now im gonna have to keep it not very happy will not order again,0
this is a nice fitting dress and it looks nice but the material is very light i can see through it i gave it 4 stars because of the material but the fabric is veryyy soft and comfortable hugs my body in all the right places,2
fits great,2
thin material,0
these socks are a little on the bigger size i ordered the 4t and up one and was surprised i could fit my foot in it so if you have a child with big feet these socks would be nice for them too i love the grips on the bottom so my little one is running around with no worries they are high i like the neutral colors good price worth the purchase,2
these just didnt last just regular use walking and hiking i do not run in these socks or put any unusual wear and tear on them but out of a pack of 6 about 4 pairs have large holes in the heels just after 9 months poor quality,0
overall a cute dress for the price however when i put it on once the bottom button came loose and the seam in 2 places in the front seem to be pulling apart a bit im 52 120lb and ordered the 02 and it fits perfect,1
the design is cleaver and prevents you from getting wet when you close the umbrella the choice of colors is good the designs are pretty my daughter liked mine so much i ordered another for her as a gift the only thing that i wish i could change is the handle design i prefer a j hook type handle but this would not affect my puchasing the umbrella all in all it is unique and practical in design i got the black with the purple flower design it was hard to choose which one to buy as there were so many that i liked ive only used it a few times but it does the job there was no wind when i used it so i cant attest to the windproof design i have had umbrellas turn inside out in heavy wind so i am curious to see how this one will hold up,2
beware these shoes scuffed and the toes rubbed off within 30 minutes of the first wear luckily my son still thinks they are cool but they are not worth the money i cant even imagine what they will look like when the season is over they are neat looking and they fit well otherwise this would be a one start review,0
id spend your money on a better one dont cheap out for this one,1
this does hook in the front but it makes your boobs into a torpedo shape,0
i would like it if it fit definitely much smaller than i expected it to be,0
do not buy looks nothing like the picture very disappointing looks like a cheap robei threw it away not even worth donating,0
cute but too small for me i am in a size 16 pant this piece would probably fit a size 11 or 10 and down,0
runs very small,0
very disappointed order first pair of my size too big ordered smaller size it fits lengthwise but when i walk my feet keep slipping out way too wide no support anywhere like a big rain boot perfect for wide feet i guess,0
item is as described and was a good purchase it was a gift for my husband and so far there are no problems with it the material is durable and the box seems to be well made,2
the iron on emblem and writing degrades the shirt considerably i doubt it will be there after a few washings hope i am wrong 2100 is a bit steep i have several marines corps tshirts that are close to 50 years old and the printing is still clear and bright this shirt wont last that long i am sure,1
this wig made my head look misshapen and it has a strange bulge or cowlick i read the reviews but as a former hair stylist i can make any head of hair look better i wasted three hours trying to make this wig look wearable its disappointing i bought it because the colors matched my pirate costume id expect to find this wig at the dollar store because i once bought a wig just like this from the dollar store and ended up i throwing it away i paid only 250 it the product picture is very misleading but the negative reviews were very accuratebr dd vasseur,0
reviewed by my wife this blouse is very pretty but sheer i have the pink one even with a white or other light colored bra it is slightly seethrough i wish the blouse was lined but it is notbr br the sleeves are gorgeous and very feminine the vneck is flattering and not too deepbr br i am 55 152 lbs and typically wear a size medium in tops this size medium fit everywhere in the back i am a little bit wider in my back and this size medium top is a bit tight in the back,1
value for money,1
i bought this bag for a recent trip to india i wanted something that would be able to carry all of my daily items comfortably and this bag delivered i was able to fit in a notebook large water bottle hand sanitizer dslr camera wallet tissues and other items compared to the purse i usually carry this was really comfortable and didnt cause any strain on my backbr br cons the rope has started to fray should be any easy fix by cutting off the flyaways but i wish theyd have braided it tighter or something and the black color although stylish collects dust really easilybr br even so i highly recommend this bag,2
i bought two of these unfortunately the loop on both shoe horns broke off within weeks of purchase you get what you pay for in this case,0
i didnt like that the description didnt show the bees on the end of the arms of sunglasses not a fan of the bees icon for men,1
great bag,2
beautiful bracelet but extremely light weight,0
this skirt pink floral is completely see through and cannot be warn unless you buy a slip separately,0
loved the earrings too large for my taste my daughter an law loves them made a beautiful gift,2
perfect fit my daughter who is quite small for her age got this for her school uniform it fit her perfect but may be small for an average child she looks so cute in it and the quality for the cost is amazing i have come to love everything by this wonderful brand i have twins who will be starting school and i know exactly where i will buy their uniforms,2
for someone not used to euro sizes this might seem to run small i got a medium at 5734 175lbs this fits snug but comfortably after living in europe for a few years i wasnt surprised by that at allbr br the best part about this product aside from being crazy stylish is in the details it has numerous pockets all small enough to not be really awkward on swimming trunks but big enough to hold stuff like your keys it also has a small fishing knife pocket the buttons on the flap open just like real lederhosen and the flap can come down for answering the call of nature without having to loosen the top it also comes with two extra buttons in case you lose one in the river,2
the sleeves are a bit short and got a hole in the leg after a few uses,1
very comfortable and nice looking and well made great for the coming fall weather but sadly like a lot of things i think its overpriced,1
i was hoping they would stay stuck a little better no support here just nipple covers,1
thank you,2
too large,1
he loved it got for fathers day its been like a little over a month and i had to e6000 the little ring because it fell off and there was a tiny space i couldnt get closed with any tools,1
son loves the shoes fyi color darkens in wet grass,1
good,1
so easy to install and doesnt prevent to fall down the cart,2
great for adding a patch too,2
super cute color is same as pictured have worn daily for months and no marks or wear and tear love this,2
nice ring but can have more detail to separate back ground more clearly and the word north should be a bit darker around lettering,1
im very happy with my purchase i am 5 feet and its over my knee which i was pleased with,2
says 18 carat gold plated but made my hand swell i have never had that happen with anything 18 platted so i gave it away cause you never give money back or replace anything,1
got this for my 17yr old and she likes iti asked her and she said quality is decent and it feels nice and not cheap shes happy with it,2
fits to size,2
lo pedí tamaño large pero ni a un niño le queda,0
i wear a shoe size 88 12 so i bought the large size 910 which fits perfectly super soft and super duper comfy buy larger than your actual size cause its got nice fluff on the inside so theyre going to run small,2
as expected for the price each choker was individually wrapped im only probably going to wear a couple out of the 8 of these but great for your money,2
not very sturdy broke after first use,0
just what i needed,2
i received the dress yesterday ordered a xl i am disappointed it looks cheaply made definitely not what i was expecting also it is rose gold not gold,0
i have a couple columbia jackets and large fits perfectly large in this vest did not fitbr i had to reorder extra large nice vest but not up to columbia standards on quality,1
color matches pair of pants looks good together which is what i wanted,2
very cute my granddaughter loves them fit snug but at least she can wear them,2
these are super comfy i had to buy a half size smaller since they seem to go a little on the large size,2
they are very sturdy well made the patterns are nice and feminine i suppose once i wash them a few times they will get softer they are about twice the size of a kleenex,2
i like the material i even bought a size bigger and it still fits tight im just glad i didnt buy my normal size i did use heat transfer vinyl on it and had no issues with the material,1
i compared this pair of crocs to the other crocs classics i own and its definitely shorter i wear a womens size 8 in this style this pair was visibly shorter when i placed the soles of the shoes against each other between half an inch to almost an inch shorter they were too uncomfortable to wear so i returned them thank you amazon for your return policy ive ordered the same shoe in a size 9 i just hope its not too large this was a disappointment though i am grateful for being able to return the shoesbr br update i have received the two pairs of size 9 classic crocs good news they fit one pair is a bit less than half an inch longer than my old trusty size 8 crocs the other pair is exactly the same size as the size 8 crocsbr br my advice is that if youve been wearing classics in a size 8 order the size 9,0
looks nice but is very thin,1
it may be low profile but it still has the artificial plastic web backing in the front which i was trying to avoid if you like a big crown on the front this would probably be just fine,0
comfy around the house dress except the neck doesnt drop down enough in the front and there is no way to get it to stretch really irritating on the front of the neck,1
i dont remember receiving or returning this shoes or ordering them i dont have this shoes,1
not well made frayed falling apart in every way,0
good fit and nice lightweight material but arrived with a tarnished button i ended up keeping this blazer since swapping the button is a quick fix but figured it would be worth mentioning,0
i still have these and have worn them maybe a couple times they dont fit well which is sad because i have no idea how id actually return them otherwise i would have returned them right after i bought if anyone reads this and knows how to private message me im happy to send you these for the cost of the shipping,0
would be really pretty if it fit as expected,1
lets talk about the fit its way too large on my broad shoulders but too small on my size 4 rear end i buy large or xlarge to accommodate my wide shoulders this is a definate no its shaped like a triangle cant say ive ever seen a shirt like this dont waste your money,0
size is so different,0
fabric and stitching are not great quality but the donut pattern is cute,1
not even close to the quality i expected they smelled like petroleum and after one wash shriveled into faded wads i could barely get on my feet bummer,0
theyre cute but i have the dior sunglasses pictured on the model and the rubber ends of this chain are too loose for those glasses,0
loved the color and drapingfit unfortunately the material quality is crap and started to unravel after the first washing didnt last long enough to actually get much use out of,0
thank you this will come in handy when im on the clinical floor i purchased one for a friend as well love it,0
i am 58 and 150 and a large fit great super comfortable flattering and easy to clean i own it in three colors,2
super tacky please see pictures,0
my kingdom for clothes cut for big n tall denizens of the usasize does matter contrary to popular belief,1
seems rather cheaply made but i havent washed it yet runs a bit small but still very cute,1
i loved these glasses but had to return them because they were too wide for my head and kept falling off my face i feel like i have a pretty big head too,1
bad fabricruns small,0
no extra links to adjust to my wrist size had to order one extra link,1
its still a great value helps me keep my things organized,2
these are trim and lightweight adequate length they still smell after four washings not hand wash washing machine wash the dye has a very strong odor that many will find offensive headache within minutes of putting on maybe more washings will eliminate the smell,1
these shoes are well made but they are heavy,1
nice warm mittens kids love them,2
el modelo es muy bonito pero el material es de mala calidad y es muy liviano se descolorizo en dos días de uso no lo recomiendo para ese precio tan elevado,0
soft material but a weird fit wider at the top than the bottom the material sucks to your body so be prepared to show every lump soft enough to keep weird enough to not wear out in public,1
cheap halloween costume material plastic buttons falling off way to tight fir a large looks very generic youll get laughed at wearing this dollar stor jacket,0
this bra is awesome the pocket is a little tough to reach but thats expected given the location of the pocket i purchased this item because when weight training or doing any kind of cross training i have no where to put my phone this product is a perfect solution for this the material and quality are great and i would definitely purchase again i got the white and its very clean and neat looking,2
these are cute and they look really pretty but theyre bigger than i thought theyre a good 23 inches tall i guess i thought they would be daintier maybe the description said so and i didnt pay attention my daughter got them for christmas and she said she likes them but im not sure if shell wear them because of the size well see,1
very warm and cozy i purchased this based in size chart other reviews claiming that the size from chart is not adequate i normally require a small to xs i went ahead and purchased the next size up based on other views i got a medium it swallowed me im 4 11 weigh 120,1
fit great and im a big dude 6ft 315,2
the color is fantastic the fit of it is terrific i am 58 and weigh between 160170 the hem comes to my knees only issues i had were it did arrive slightly wrinkled due to way it was packaged and you will need no line undergarments otherwise the panty lines are visible i am delighted with this dress i ordered it for a weekend away to celebrate our 25th silver anniversary and i am very pleased with he purchase,2
i really wish i would have looked at this item much closer before i washed it the hem is extremely uneven and the bottom is quite twisted and uneven now i cannot return it because its been washed,1
i bought a large rather than a large tall because the 6 2 model was said to be wearing a medium and it looked long enough 4 of his 6 2 must be in his legs i am 6 and the shirt is a little too short it is going back i may try again with a large tall if they have any reasonable colors choices are few,1
absolutely love this dress the material is really soft on the inside and feels great when wearing it i ordered my normal size s and it fit perfectly the straps are easy to adjust and the dress is a great length as well,2
at least 1 to 1 12 sizes smaller than needed order 1 size up at least doubtful that half size up will be enough,1
bought these for a new job right out of the box they were very comfortable and i had no issues wearing them all day without any breakin timebr i purposefully waited about 2 months to write a review as i usually do for any clothing footwear electronics etcbr unfortunately the sole of the left boot has already begun to give way so much so that there is maybe 14 inch of material from the crack of the sole to the inside of the boot theyve been getting increasingly worse over the last few days and are now to the point of being unwearable this is quite disappointing as the comfort was great and i intended to buy a second pair but with a useable life of just two months these are not worth it for me to use maybe it was a oneoff defect in the sole construction but i cant justify trying them again,0
great construction and quality very comfortable and warm it fits snug in the front but over time i am sure it will fit better i would buy another one if they had one in 11 wide,2
order cancelled didnt pass thu customs,0
i never received the little purse attached to it,1
see above,2
a little tight they are okay,1
nice well made boot they look nice they were big and fit a little funny since they ran big my husband didnt find them very comfortable maybe if a smaller size than what he normally wears was purchased they would have fit better and felt more comfy,1
good boots no complain,2
you get what you pay for my daughter was thrilled with the look and feel of these boots i however wasnt pleased to see that crease marks showed up after one wear and the sole feels very flimsy i expected as much though for the price,1
pulls in material even prior to wearing its a shame because i love the fit and weight of the material,0
it appears to be made for someone with a lot of hair you have to tuck and stuff excess material,0
ive bought variations of this shoe in suede and leather but this little number is flatout gorgeous a lowkey metallic that is as comfortable as a sneaker and yet you look absolutely kewl wearing it just about anywherebr br the silver flat actually looks great with a gown when youre walking and dont want to destroy your feet in heels you can dance and have fun in them and look great or just put them on to drive and switch to the tottering heels when you get to the ball but i bet you wont these shoes look great anywherebr br im definitely going to be investing in them in all three metallics im already on my fourth pair of this style of skechers and im just praying they keep making them best walking and looking shoe i ever owned,2
this watch face is too bigmight be popular these days but i dont like it,0
although these leggings arent made by tesla the car company theyre greatbr br i dont overheat when working out with these at a heated indoor gym and they keep my legs a bit warmer during cold days more than the thermal aspect though these leggings provide great 34support34 down low and feel like second skinbr br i was worried that the seams might bother me when ordering but i dont even notice them once i put the leggings on would recommend to a friend,2
love the hat i got a lot of comments about it i like that it is adjustable so i can wear it when i golf,2
i received many compliments,2
i first saw this type of item when my greek neighbor wore one then when we were in tarpon springs fl i went into a greek shop and they had a lot of jewelry with the eye they believe it wards off evil and jealousy so i ordered this one because when i think of jealousy i think of greeneyed jealously,2
these will fit a pretty small child pretty tight on my 10 year old daughter shes using them for biking to prevent blisters so far so good but she wont be able to wear them for long as she will outgrow them soon,1
reading the size chart i bought a size large my measurements are 382738 or if some just measure by chest size i am a 36d i like a wrap style because being a little on the busty side dresses that have a defined waistline usually ride too high on me and the waist is sitting on my ribs instead of my waist this dress fits me nicely it is not tight nor is it loose it just follows my curves if i lose any more weight i will need to take it in but for now it is a perfect fit as i said it just skims the body so i dont look lumpy and bumpy it fits me like pictured on the model i am smiling from ear to ear that i found this for such a cheap price i had been trying on dresses in macys etc 5 times the price but none of them looked as good on me as this i had my doubts when i ordered it but i am so glad that i took the chance with this dress,2
printed letters on redwine color shown as black but actually white letters not as attractive and does not match black shorts i had hoped to pair with shirt is nice material and fits well however,0
fit like a glove for the price it was more than expected i bought a large,2
recommend buying just size up im a 34d and 6ft tall and this runs small and short for me in a medium,1
i only wish they were a little longer,1
cannot get them to break in and be comfortable so i never wear them but they are really cute,1
i loved the cowcow skater skirt i ordered so i decided to purchase this dress because i wanted to have one with sleeves i am 5134 102 lbs and i ordered the small unfortunately is it extremely huge on me and i dont care for the fact that the waistline is not at all fitted like the skater skirt this dress basically just hangs there shapeless and unflattering i doubt even the xsmall would look much better im extremely disappointed as the material and the look of the flamingo skater skirt was adorable guess i will have to return it and wait for the other 2 skirts i had ordered arrive in july,0
i was looking forward to getting these earrings but wont be able to wear them they are very pretty but the weight of them stretches my earlobe they also hung lower than i had anticipated i have a 15 year old family member that loves them so i gave them to her instead of returning them they would make a beautiful gift for the right person they just didnt work for me personally,1
not sure why i was sent a different pattern than the blue ones i selected but i kept them anyway they were slightly itchy not my favorite pair rarely wear them,1
these are adorable but they were too small i needed them for a costume and they were too small on my face i hope i can return them,1
neither watches work the dail broke off one as i was setting the time the other one just ticks in place too bad because they are cute,0
great material perfect color for what my wife needed was very big had to return,1
although i already ordered a size up from what i usually wear its still tight near my bust and i specially ordered a size up so that i get that loose fit overall but its snug fit even for a size up,1
the suit is very cute and i loved the color but the material is too thin flimsy when i tried it on i felt like it would rip right off if i jumped into a swimming pool additionally im typically a medium but i ordered a large due to some of the reviews and it still felt too small,0
first too largethen washed per instructions in cold water now way too small it shrunk at least 4 around not shorter now fits my 98 lb daughter label said cant return after tag was removed,0
this product fits way to small company out to be a shame selling things that dont fit there customers,0
true to size did not shrink in dryer,2
i like the bag i just thought it would be bigger,1
bought this for my son for his birthday and he loves it he like te way it feels and fitshes 61 265lbs,2
shirt was too small after it was washed,1
great,2
beautiful craftsmanshipi love itill be purchasing more items when available,2
i like the shirt but i should have bought one size larger,1
the item is cute didnt expect great quality considering the price and it is ok but i ordered an xl size and now my daughter is wearing it my daughter wears an xs or oo she actually likes luckily im never ever buying any clothes from china,0
i love these i get so many compliments,2
the quality isnt as good as i thought it would be the embroidery frame really bad ran small for the size,1
great little every day watch but i am in love with casio products,2
im sure the ring was beautiful but it showed up smashed and could not be repaired,0
these wear very comfy but they are sized small not determined by body fit but they cut under the arms so definitely order a size larger than you think youll need,2
fit perfectly and was a light weight fabric for the hot and humid trip to hawaii,2
used these as a girl scout troop gift i ironed on felt letters without any issues really great value would purchase again,2
i am nonbinary and i love this bag as a genderneutral option it is lightweight and easy to maneuver i like that it has pockets to find things in it,2
kind of thin and cheap but ok if you just want to take something tiny in your pocket or pocketbook,1
i returned this dress the fabric and quality were fine but the fit wasnt good for me the dress looked very frumpy on me and it was too long,0
even tho i wear an 8 they were too largebin waist even after washing and drying them i had to take in the back seam at waist area for better fit,1
cute,2
was expecting a 34large tall34 to fit like a large but longer its basically an xl or an xxl if i had wanted one of those i wouldnt have bought a 34tall34 sized shirt,0
received item in repacked bag with no tags not even inside top ordered a small but would have fit my xl husband,0
this is super cute when you walk away the front view is frumpy the fabric is the worst feeling synthetic like my grammys old nightie ugh,0
are beautiful but the quality are not good and need more strech textil,2
good looking watch but tried half the day to get the time set i followed the instructions but the time would not set i bought it for my mom who is blind but decided to return it when i couldnt get it to work right,1
soft good fit impressed with the cushioning for a then type walking sock highly recommended,2
great quality,2
there is no swing to this top at all its tight way smaller than an xl should be and cheap material,0
for our daughter,2
these are perfect in the size s56 for my 3534 32 lb 20 month old they shrank a bit when i washed and dried them the first time anything below a 4t is tight on her waist but of course the legs are always too long and have to be cuffed so i thought 34capris would be perfect34 and they are i have two in each color black and grey nice thick soft stretchy cotton they have the same issue all little girl leggings have though a cut that doesnt take diapers into account which is fine if the pants youre buying are intended for bigger pottytrained girls but we all know that the leggings sold in infant sizes are exactly the same low inseam which means unless your kid is in a onesie which she wont be because they dont really sell onesies above size 2t youll always see the top of her diaper poking out whenever her shirt rides up and as soon as she pees in her diaper once or twice youll be able to plainly see a bulky bulge going down one pant leg especially if shes been sitting in the car seat or stroller maybe i should seek out some 34harem34 pants for her or just put her in dresses more often lord knows she has enough of them but im always worried about her getting them dirty anyway great pants,2
my husband looks great in it,2
i expected a cheaper material but was quite pleased with the quality of these glasses four stars instead of five because id like to get them in other colors too but none were offered,2
cute just too small,2
the gold pieces were extremely tarnished so disappointed returning,0
bag appears as pictured except there is no interior pocket as advertised product lost one star for false advertising,2
i love these leggings they are so light other long leggings will get too tight on my legsmuscles when i workout and make it uncomfortable these are so light and allow me to move and stretch they also dont squeeze my stomach like so many other workout pants do will definitely be buying more of these,2
if you want to add a couple inches to your height here you go i found them to be ankle breakers for me as a walking shoe so i dont wear them often they are otherwise comfortable cool and fashionable if you dont mind the side to side tipping factor,1
very cheap material but you get what you pay for i got this in the mail and the material was super wrinkly and staticky hopefully it washes okay,1
needed this to wear for a memorial service needed the specific color very comfortable and flattering to my figure,2
i really like the way this bra fits i got it because it had a full refund return but i am happy to report it fits i am a 36dd and it was a good purchase i am not as perky as i was as a teen but this bra makes me look like i am lol,2
its a little smaller then expected and mine arrived with a broken button and i had to return,1
ran really small,1
too large,0
these are not one size fits most if you are larger than a medium these will not fit they are also very thin when i was putting them on for the first time they got a hole in them i love leggings and buy them all the time i wanted this color but these we a huge disappointment,0
i had to return this because the letter is much more silver than i expectedwanted i thought i was getting a really dark gun metal grey but thats just not the case i dont know if its because the picture has been taken in the wrong lighting or what but its a little misleading the reason for the two stars is because the key ring itself seems to be pretty decent quality,0
this romper is very cute looks well made however im not sure its true to size maybe i should have ordered a bigger size i really like it thou,2
the front of these shoes are narrow and caused my daughter to have blisters,1
love it,2
labeled as one size fits all but i was sent a small no options for size offered was returned,0
this is solid quite heavy i would probably not use it for my house keys but i keep the key to my lab on it very high quality im tickled that they got the major anatomy correct,2
got this dress for 11 during a flash sale and it is my new favorite stretchy material fits as expected a little long on me but i am short,2
threads are lose and falling out too small wrinkles easy shrunk when i washed itthe tag says dry clean and 35cotton and 65 polyester like every other product from here,0
its nice even though top part of dress is not as blousy as pictured thinner stretchy material eg polyester im a 40d and size 16 57 220 lbs and goes to my knees it is really tight but nothing smoother cant handle belt is not wide like the pic its an xl fits like a size 14 honestly but im loosing weight so i knew this before buying,1
decent quality i was sent a second because the first appeared used i ended up returning both in the end because i wasnt happy with the fit,2
super cute velcro could be sturdierbr br after only a few months of wear the strap completely broke off and we had to throw these away very dissappointed,0
product does not match the described color at all all advertisement photos show a tiffany blueturquoise what came is a baby blue with lavender tones does not look at all seen online,0
red dye on my skin and under clothing tried wading three times to help without luck not something i would buy again,0
the fit was fine on the bottom but i dont know who they designed the top for my breasts were squashed the fit was simply terrible and i had to return the itembr br that said it was well made and the return was simple,1
it was kinda expensive but its cute,1
ordered my size and was way to small,0
casio mens ws200h1bvcf tough solar powered multifunction digital sport watchbr the clock measures received are smaller than i desired look size womans watch,0
these are great alittle hot some times but not bad just dont get the wet after midnight i accidentally got mine wet and they turned into gremlins the fuzz matted the sewed in insole folded in half leaving a lump in the bottom i trying to play doctor and make a small incision reached in with some long screw drivers tried to straighten everything out that worked for a minute or two but then i ended up doing a full insolependectomy now my one foot is cold the other one that did not get wet is still rocking after several months of use,2
stones were too dark didnt look green,0
not good,0
these are great they fit perfect and under water is crystal clear my husband loves them,2
these gave me just the right dressy look for my step daughters wedding i was looking for purple but these little pink earings have a pink light purple blend the backings fit very well and the earings dont poke my neck,2
the floral print looks tacky too embarrassed to wear,0
not a good fit,0
simply nice classic looking,2
the price is definitely right for this product but it took a very long time to get it it is large and looks good on a chain the color was not true to the picture for it was more white than pink and that was a disappointment the silver workmanship was good and held the stone tight,1
love the necklace and the price they are a very reliable seller delivery fast merchandise great quality i have purchased a number of things from them and have never been disappointed,2
i dont know how they make this top its very thin and it has a weird shape and it look different than the picturebr return it at the same day i got it,0
disliked it,0
thick puffy did not like the material,0
very figure flattering just wish it was a little longer,2
returned this item because the numerical size listed was ridiculously small for the huge fit too bad they looked cute otherwise,0
these clips work very nicely to cover the silicone stopper for your beads but i will say i never received the round clip stopper that they show as advertised i dont appreciate that,2
nice sunglasses and very stylish but they do not have enough april g loaded arms,1
the idea is fantastic the design isnt the best theres something about the color of the pin that the actual taco blends in with the white background so you dont really see what is it until you stare from reeeeal close i guess the picture is pretty accurate about it i just didnt realize this until having the actual pin too bad,1
i bought these as back ups to my 34power trip xl34 and they are not as nice or as wide as my primary pair these seem to have a cheaper plastic and the lenses are not as 34polarized34 as my primary pair they are however very wide at 148 mm and will fit most large heads they are also a matted black so they do not have the shiny appeal of my primary pairbr br unfortunately for me they are currently out of stock on my other pair so i had to take a chance on these and at 3500 i cant say i would order them because of the difference in lens and matted color i guess i have just gotten spoiled with my other pair and was a bit disappointed when i dived thesebr br as far as sunglasses go they are okay and that is why i am rating them as such,1
skirt is see through,0
the size was way to small i bought a xxl because i wanted it to fit over sweat shirts and sweaters however it would even come close to closing,1
love them but they are starting to look a bit worn due to washing,2
the fit is a bit strange feeling they stretch but not much just not super comfy like i expected,1
awesome the lass loves it,2
i have ordered this watch for several years now its a great watch with the back light which is good cause i work at night so it makes it easier to read the time without having to go to a well lit place if you have a small wrist like i do youll have to get it sized but walmart will do it for cheap like i said i love this watch,2
i bought a set for myself and my husband for motorcycle trips everything needs to be compact to fit in the small side cases these are great if they last that would even be greater so far no sign of issues,2
i ordered my normal size and wound up disappointed because they were too tight if i sized up these would have been perfect the shoes themselves were super cute and comfortable its too bad i ended up returning them,1
so far this winder hits every key feature goodlooking the black finish is sleek and the internal blue led is a nice touch all four operating modes worked as speced and its surprisingly quiet while rotating the unit was packaged nicely held securely in the box on both ends and the window was covered with a plastic protective layer that adhered to it no cosmetic problems at all when it arrived ive tried all four operating modes and they work fine the fifth mode is off the switch for the led is on the back as cool as it is to run the winder with the light on its very easy to switch it off as desired and that can be done while in operation the onoff and mode switch is inside its a little tight to grasp where they placed it but its not a significant negative if you decide to change the mode or want to turn the unit off while its running just open the display window and the rotation stops very simple to use the only negative the winder comes with a usb power cord but no adaptor thats not uncommon with many devices and normally doesnt faze me but in this case since i want to keep it plugged in all the time id have preferred it if theyd included one again im not dinging them for it because like most people i have plenty of them but usually the devices that omit them just need an adaptor temporarily for charging and then its less of an inconvenience but in the bigger picture this is still a goodlooking display device the winder so far works very well and its much quieter than id ever expected i cant see any issue with noise even if you run it on a nightstand while you sleep this is a pretty good value for the money hopefully the motor lasts as long as the more expensive models time will tell pun intended,2
cheap and great fit love these my 3rd pair,2
great material and good quality but the size is much larger than what it shows when reviewing the size to place your order therefore mine is too big,1
nice,2
these were the best thing for my achilles as the padding area is awesome where they fall apart is that they literally fall apart elsewhere within 2 months of playing ultimate disc the underside ripped open on the bottom of the heel as there is a lot of juking and cutting involved probably be okay for runners not making intense change of direction but football and soccer players you may have different results follow washing instructions do by hand id give it 4 stars if it would at least last 6 months to a year fortunately the padded area does remain intact so i still find them useful even if they are torn the comfort outshines the annoyance,1
they are 2 sizes smaller than labeled,0
chain broke but my daughter loves the charm,1
this should be negative stars i put the clicker in because the septum ring i had in previously the ball fell off and i didnt want it to close it ive only worn it a few days and it started turning green,0
pretty but has a strange metallic smell like very cheap metal,1
i went up on a size on this dress and it is still too small,0
rush is one of my favorite bands of all timebr good quality and received fastbr no issues with product,2
i would have liked it to be bigger,1
xl was more like l possibly m,1
im not a fan of pullon boots because they generally seem geared toward people with narrow feet i wear a 105w11w and these looked narrow right out of the box i successfully pulled on the right boot after a major struggle once i got it on i already knew it wouldnt fit the left foot since i deal with more swelling on that side i tried to get it on the left foot and gave upbr br the length is probably accurate its the width thats a problem and i dont have superwide feet the fabric really likes to attract lint and i feel like the version i got black imus whatever that is made it look better aesthetically some of the other variations look especially cheap and childlike i would pass on these especially at 50,1
good fit,2
a little 34light34 but they go with many of my outfits,1
package said it was lost so i canceled it what a shame because it looked cute,0
unfortunately i did not receive the 4 different colors as shown i received two of the same color not happy about this,1
these jeans are very poor quality they lasted about 2 days then i be tried to get them replaced and got nothing but 3 weeks of run around,0
the size ran too small im disappointed because i really liked the look of them,0
cant say i really love these ive really wanted to get some for some time but hadnt taken the plunge due to the cost we finaly decided to grab some for our trip to mexico and wish i would have just bought some of the keen hiking sandals insteadbr i wore them for a solid week before the trip to try and break them and my foot in but they were still so painful the whole vacation they are quite narrow the 34arch support34 starts way to far back on the heel area so it does nothing and they run very narrow to i have a bunch of blistersbr once you get some sand in between your foot and the material they are literally impossible to wear without rubbing all your skin off also once they get sand inside where the straps run they are very difficult to tighten and loosen and no amount of cleaning thus far has remedied that my wife also got a pair of womens and has all of the same issuesbr i wont be buying chaccos again thats for sure im going to keep wearing them every now and again just to get my moneys worth so ill update my review if some amount of break in changes all of the above,0
longer than expected bill and i really had to tighten it to fit my head,1
the orchid row reversible satin and chiffon wrap is perfect for an evening to dress up your outfit the satin side is shiny and the chiffon side is matte it is long and it is generous in the amount of fabric used this is a one size and smaller women may find that it swallows them up you can style the wrap as you would a scarf it has many options on how you choose to wear the wrap for me it is great over my shoulders the wrap is made of 100 polyester and can be machine washed hang to dry and then use a low iron,2
my daughter will be snow white for halloween which is why i bought this costume i wish the material of the dress was better quality but i guess i get what i pay for right the front portion of the headpiece that lines my forehead was cut very choppy so ill have to fix that or i may even purchase a different headpiece i saw on amazon for the evil queen the strap to hold the headpiece is also too long i really like the collar it really puts the whole costume together my familys opinion of it is that it is fine since its only for one night and will do its job,1
i normally wear a size 11 and they were way to small the toe box is also too small i have a wider foot but these still felt too small the fur lining is comfortable but the backs of my heels fall out of the shoes when i walk up stairs because the top tongue does not come far enough up the shoe also the placement of the drawstring seems to be a bit too forward toward the toe im returning them and looking for something else,1
erroneously marketed as a 34boys34 watch on tightest notch it slides down my 10 yos arm and bangs into his wrist especially when running or biking otherwise the watch is fine,1
this top just wasnt what i expected it was a little large and stiff and the seams like where the lace met the fabric were more overlapped than i thought they would be,0
very pretty and a bit larger than i expected have had zirconias that were a bit better cut but these are fine for daily wear and i like the fact that they are sterling and not a cheaper metal,2
not a great fit just ok i would not buy again,1
purchased as a gift for my husband he loves it,2
the shirt is very cute though it runs somewhat small in the bust area 5134 34a 105lbssize smallcute with a cami very comfortable,2
too big,0
this is the most comfy shirt fits great looks great gabba gabba hey 1234 go buy one,2
why is this shirt displayed as if the sleeve and the body is tapered the sleeve and the body looks nothing like the shirt in person,0
this bathing suit fits just as expected i like it all much i took it on vacation received many compliments,1
the overall design is cute and the fabric is soft however mine is badly sewn making it wrinkle and poke outward at the side it had deodorant marks on it when it arrived so i wonder if someone returned it before me i will probably return itbr br im a flat 32b 59534 125 lbs and small seems like the right size it would be more flattering on someone with bigger boobs the back looks like im getting hints of back rolls despite me being thin so i wouldnt want it smaller,1
this isnt blush it is dull and not flattering the shape and fit were great i sent it back do to the awful color,1
the description of this hat says its bill isbr 3 14 inches long but thats entirely untrue its around 56 inches its incredibly awkward to wear unless you want to look like the kid from sandlot maybe but one for a halloween outfit or somethingbr do not buy one of these hats trust me you wont wear it,0
not my favorite i liked the pjs i got everyone else way better,0
too large for me,0
these always got stuck in my hair and were a pain to wear,0
as another reviewer stated zooshoos sends out soda shoes despite selling it as sole addiction or some other brandbr br shoes run wide but are otherwise fairly comfortablebr br 2 stars because it odd buying one brand and getting anotherbr br going go wait and see a couple of weeks to see how the quality holds up,0
i wear euro 44 i bought it 445 but its small like 435 or something buy it one size upbr the foam is weired not very comfy as i read in the reviews,0
love the pattern and the strechablity but i got a small and they are too big on my wrist so im unable to wear them,1
way smaller than expected,1
this shirt pleasantly surprised me i love it,2
no room to move,1
there is a little bit of flaws the black box is a bad song,2
it is pretty but it fit my daughter who is a size 0 i had to alter it and cut the waist,0
went downtown to do a pub crawl and they were super comfortable and fit great just be careful walking in them as i scraped the front pointy bit of the shoe on the sidewalk and ruined them a bit but overall wonderfully made,2
i enjoyed this watch for the first 812 months but the band is fairly cheap and more importantly the watch doesnt work it used to be that i had to turn it ahead a minute or two each day as it would fall behind that wasnt a huge deal now though it goes way too fast i reset it each morning but within a couple hours it is 10 minutes fast and that just continues throughout the day making the watch basically uselessbr br very disappointing,0
this dress is cute for one wear the material is soft to touch however midway through the day i noticed that the material started to wear out and fuzz up right in certain areas i was bummed because i liked the overall style,1
i wore these one time and got a hole super upset because they were so cute,0
it my a future ballerina very happy,2
way too small,0
when i first bought this shirt i got 2 colors before washing it was a nice lightweight pimatype cotton shirt with the sheen i very much like the style however since i washed them the sheen is gone and it feels like regular teeshirt material and is wrinkled also it shrunk lengthwise which wasnt appreciated i still wear them but theyve been downgraded from workappropriate to just weekend wear sad,1
thought i would buy a bigger size so it would be roomy but it fits way to small,0
outfit was small and uncomfortable i ended up sending it back,0
pretty but runs small,1
my daughter loved this but it broke after 5 months,1
my son ordered this he got his lip pierced on his birthday im not crazy about it so i have nothing to say except it took forever to get here,0
as pictured and fit well but frames were a little crooked,2
good idea to order size up runs small,1
the nose was falling off of one witch and the jacket was coming off another poor quality,0
looks cheap not for work attire,0
i love spyder products and have many sweaters and ski pants i thought i would love this ski jacket but it was bulky on and not form fitting as i had hoped the quality seems good but just too bulky for me,1
i liked the way it looked and felt but it was too small and had no stretch,0
videoidde0e3c3c6aebf62afc22a3d851cd2cfd its def a steal im going to order the black one next i recently wore it to ny in the freezing cold and it held me up of course layer up under its not super crooked but perfect for a club outfit or outing if you wanna wear something but dont wanna ruined your outfit with a big jacket get it,2
i asked my husband to try this buttoned down mens tailored dress shirt and im so glad i did he usually wears blue dress shirts which look fine on him but i have to say that this buttoned down shirt which we got in white makes him look very handsome and puttogether the shirt fabric is a beautiful and crisp 100 supima cotton we could really feel the fine quality of the material the shirt is also a very bright solid white color that makes it look very new and bright hes worn it with dark blazers and under dark suits and the stark white shirt really stands out the shirt is classy and refined looking yet still looks appropriate when worn tucked or untuckedbr br in terms of fit and comfort my husband said the shirt fits perfectly and is both comfortable and nicely tailored he likes that the waist of the shirt is cut slimmer so it doesnt billow up when he wears it untuckedbr br i realize that this is an amazon brand but this shirt looks and feels like an expensive name brand dress shirt from a fancy mens shop,2
looks good lasted a few years,2
average quality for the price,1
cute costume fits well decent quality for the price,2
really cute but the shoulders were too narrow could not lift arms,1
the sneaker is cheaply made and not very comfortable,0
piece of crap material with horrible sizing do not buy,0
huge flaw on back i was leaving on a trip and i have no time to return it unwearable,0
im 57 and this is too short excellent quality though,1
my kid loves it holds up in the wash just great,2
i ordered based on the size chart and was barely able to pull the bra down over my chest definitely runs much smaller than advertised,0
not great quality,1
when this shirt arrived i was very happy seemed like a well built shirt but then i washed itbr the collar shrank into one big puckered mess this shirt gets one star and the second star is for the air freshener that came with it,0
its likely china made and sizes very small i would likely get 2 sizes about your normal l,0
for 12 this was a great deal i got these for my fiance since he needed new shoes for softball hes normally an 11 but can sometimes fit into a 105 they are a little tight but do fit,2
great product but i did not get a size 11 in mens its was a size 11 in womens which defeats the purpose of it being a mens flip flop,0
as a bigger girl i find these perfectly comfortable not getting cut into anywhere plus has a nice padding to shape things right,2
this is really overpriced for a plastic purse i think it works but havent actually found a way to test it but i do have a purple light that will help identify bacteria that said for 35 this should have included a battery its ok but its odd,1
this is a pretty shirt nice fabric im on the fence wether to keep it or not because i have bigger breasts 34d and this shirt gaps on the armpit area i love the color,1
just received this and it looks nothing like the picture its far smaller than described very disappointed will probably return it,0
this shirt is shiny and feels like its made of vinyl it was very hot and uncomfortable i have other shirts that cost a similar amount that are much nicer the fit was also a bit small i would recommend this shirt only in an emergency,0
minimal materials butsufficient protection without unecessary design,2
shoes look nice but are not well balanced and too high,1
beautiful,2
i was running out of time to find a hat for a tea party and ended up buying this on amazon its probably a one use item for me,0
the suze is just a little bit off my regular size was a bit tight but my chest is large the top is very cute and looks nice on,1
too sheer returned it,0
love the fabric but the cut is a little off the waist fits nice but the arms are tight i ordered a small that has been fitting fine but i think a medium would be too big and the pocket ruins the flow,1
really like this and they fit really well going to order some extras,2
these are not polarized trust me false advertising,0
works great,2
my husband loved them good quality,2
nice looking watch the instructions say it may be off two or three minutes daily you also shouldnt try to adjust the time between 9pm and 3am or it will reduce the lifetime of the watchbr br after carefully following the instructions to wind it mine turned out to be defective,0
i absolutely love this coat it fits perfectly and looks amazing on my five year old son who is in love with the style it is a bit thin for winter but with a sweater or fleece underneath i think it would be just finebr br great product very happy with my purchase,2
i love the boot super comfortable but after 5 months this is very disappointing soles cracked on both boots,0
i ordered an xl and i am a medium and its still too small cheaply made,0
i like it good for the price,2
fleece inside is plush and soft but it doesnt clamp around your head and stay it slides down your ears needing you to almost hold them in place for them to be usable,1
they were too small for my 9 year olds face,1
nice design but small knots looks and fits like child sizebr i have smaller than average size head,1
nb usually has great arch support but these seem to have none the width is true and my feet have room to wiggle but i had to remove the insole and replace with a 60 insole from birkenstock so this isnt very costeffective still the rest of the shoe seems okay,1
arrived broken but was an easy fix arrived on time and just like the picture,1
quality material thick leather will likely buy other colors,2
this shirt worked out perfect the size was a good and it washed good,2
i like that these socks are warm and fuzzy with decent grip but theyre strangely thin and feel like theyll start to fall apart after 1020 washes,1
disappointed as the band broke after wearing for one week,0
too small,0
purchased for my dad for fathers day he loved them,2
the shoes fit according to size so good shipping was fast and on time im giving them three stars so far in the winter ill be able to tell if they do the job,1
we bought 2 other pairs of lightup skechers whose lights died after maybe a day of wear these ones have been used and abused by my 5yo for at least a couple months now and the lights are still going strong best pair so far,2
a little more casual than we thought a but rumpled looking,1
nice but to bulky,0
this is the worst quality of graphic printing ive ever seen looks so faded you can barely tell they are feathers image must be superimposed because it most certainly does not look like the picture here and it came in damaged not worth the month wait whatsoever,0
the fit was ok kind of short and fatter the material its made out of sucks the first and only time i wore it by the end of the day i had probably 10 snags in it i work at a desk all day so im not hard on my clothes then the big mistake i accidentally dried it and it shrunk about 5 sizes and now looks like its for a kid,0
fit good,2
exactly what i needed im 67 and this tie is a great fit,2
really liked the design i got the white black marbled ones they are too small i would have exchanged for an xl but they out of the xl in the design i am 57 180lbs i can go between a large and xl in these type of pants these i should have done xl,1
good product,2
poor desctiption as there is no way these could fit any adult unless they wear a size 3 shoedissapointing tp wait in pain for a product i would not have ordered were it correctly described,0
i ordered a large and was really excited about this romper however the style fit my body really weird and it was tight around the crotch and just was not flattering in any way returning for sure,0
nice fabric but much smaller than the size description,1
i love these bodycon midis so much when i was pregnant they were so flattering and comfy now im 5 weeks post partum and wouldnt think about wearing them lol,2
the outfit was on i felt it could have has better quality closing in the back like a zipper or hooks i had to ass my own zipper in the back,1
i just made sgt with the doc i wanted smaller sets stripes for my shirt but can not find them anywhere these look better on a jacket since they are so big made well and as usual the backs fly off and you will need to replace them other then size good product,2
the combination of colors is killer it feels well made too i bought this 6 months ago for my suv key fobs however after about half a dozen uses the screw broke off i personally would recommend this now but its possible my experience was a one off thing,0
a great looking and comfortable set of suspenders,2
not bad,1
wonderful backpack for traveling super light and perfect for budget airlines,2
good gift for older kids however they seem to loose their glow over time it might be better in black light i have not tried that yet they are just a fun peice of costume jewelry,1
not what i expected a bit expensive for what i got,1
was smaller than sizing indicated also too long,0
gets the job done,2
took a day or two to settle down but is now very accuratebr br unfortunately the date is very difficult to read in anything less than brilliant lightingbr br strap is kinda small for a large watch like this my wrist is 75 and im on the second from last holebr br otherwise i love itbr br has that 1960s race driver look to it,2
i bought this in the biggest size because i wanted it to look like the picture first of all this sweater was not red like the picture the picture is more of a deep red this was bright neon red orange also the sizing was way too small i ordered 2xl so it would be slouchy and it was a small medium didnt even fit me im 56 212 pounds this sweater aint it,0
pros the ring is exactly what i wanted the sizing is perfect the color was great and it stands outbr br cons after oy a day of wearing it the edges of the diamond started to darken and now the point is darkened too ive cleaned it with soap and water and alcohol but the ring just keeps getting scratched and scuffed definitely should have bought a dark ring to start,1
wonderful slippers,2
the belt itself is pretty but even though it stretches is is small and thin,1
consbr they do fit somewhat big so i could have gone a 12 a size down the material is very different from the minimus ive had in the past it does feel kinda cheap for that i think the shoes should cost less the tongue does sit high so it cuts into the front of your ankle and thats with socks on im sure it would cut skin without socks or with low sitting socksbr br prosbr even with the tongue cutting in walking around in them all day my feet are not sore at the end of the day anymorebr br updatebr i have run in these shoes and it was really great they felt very light and even with the tongue touching my ankle it wasnt a bother,1
54 120 pounds ordered size small skirt this skirt fits perfectly is comfortable and is definitely flattering i do have a few one issue with it though the fabric is very thin so so you can see through it i bought the white skirt so any underwear or tucked in shirt is very visible the other downfall with the thin fabric is that you can see seams both my underwear and shirt lines were visible through the skirt i think if this skirt just had an extra layer of white fabric underneath these problems would be solved personally i think i will be looking for a skirt made of a thicker material so that i dont have to worry i also feel that a thicker material looks more professional,1
i had to have this dress shortened several inches so that it would hit just above my knee im 5 134 i paid about as much to the tailor as i did on the dress its definitely bodyconscious and the fabric is a little thin so youll want a goodquality seamless girdle to hold in your tummy pooch if you have one other than that i really like it,2
they start to tarnish and turn black real quick,0
my daughter loves this dress it is a little cheaply made for what you pay for but otherwise perfect little dress,1
true to size looks nice and is comfortable,2
nice slipper but i have a wide foot were a little narrow,1
great material,2
i wear size 10 clothing and the size 6 panties were perfect,2
the buttons are falling off and the seams are coming apart the edges are so frayed there is no way this will hold up in the wash i am returning this,0
odd fabric,1
the comfort is fine but the picture is barely recognizable as chewbacca the product image is very misleading,0
stick is good but the size is very small than expected,0
good fit except for one pant leg is shorter than the other i didnt expect to get factory rejects form such a popular company as amazon,0
my daughter ismedium size this was smaller,1
cheap material after the wrinkles came out it looks cute needs to be washed carefully as i am already seeing tiny holes at the seams,1
good product for the price,2
this shoe felt very comfortable from a cushioning standpoint but the width was too narrow send it back for a wider width,1
very comfortable bra has good support and the top is flowy doesnt stick to you nice color good fabric,2
by far my favorite of these goes with anything made well,2
this polo fits great and the colors look great together if youre rooting for lando or danny ric but not a big fan of papaya youll love this color combobr br my only complaint is the collar after washing it it no longer lays flat and has a wavy look to it since i dont iron my husband just deals with it,2
too wide,1
a little narrow and i do not have wide feet they are very hot so would be great if you live in cold weather but i live in florida i will wear them and hope they break in and get a little wider,1
this is such a pretty dress great material and flow not very stretchy and lined well to combat the sheerness,2
the best winter hat ever,2
these flops looked very pretty however the insole is like high grit sandpaper they were rough on my feet when i walked around the room needless to say i returned them amazon is great about returns no problem ever we order a lot of stuff,1
a little thin but great price,1
love how it looks and fits but unfortunately only lasted one use so really disappointing,0
love this top really comfy and cute design looks great with jeans,2
the quality is fine on this shirt but this style always seems to make me look like an old lady not sure why i will wear it at home but not when i am out and about,1
product size described is not a true size or not even close to the true size very dissoppointed after returning 3 times found the correct size for my kid quality one to two use do not waste your money for this swim suit,0
like the idea like the item although does not adjust in less you remove links from the bracelet so it is difficult to get the right fit one link removed it was still too big 2 links removed it was still too small,1
these do not stay in,0
way too tight and small and i normally wear about a 1214 and according to the other reviews this should have been fine i had to return it,0
i ordered the size the graph suggested i wish i would have gone up a size also the band rolls which might not be as bad if i had gone bigger,1
these bras are pretty supportive of my 38d self the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the pads fall out in the washer didnt realize they even had pads when i ordered them and the covering that makes it easier to put the pads back in seems to come off pretty easily,2
really love the style and color very disappointed in the quality for twenty bucks o could have got something much better at a department store the fabric is very thin and cheap feeling the fit was also poor i got a size 2x to be sure it would fit and its still snug the length is great but the arms are tight and its tight around the middle to be fair a thinner person wouldnt have this problem but i did get a size larger than usual to try to make sure it would fit overall a nice shirt but not worth the amount i spent for it,1
i like the product but the face broke off one of them but other than that its awesome,2
i did not receive the pockets pictured i received the second edition pockets without the lace sides not what i wanted,0
this watch is completely damaged and the second it got wet it was damaged screen faded out and water was all in the entire watch i do not recommend this watch for anyone,0
this dress did not fit as expected i ordered a large and i am usually a medium the lace on the top of the dress was nicely crafted however it had no give i could not get the dress over my chest,0
sad this should never have been wrapped and boxed what a pity,0
this product was not for me it fit very weird,0
bows fell off first time trying them on otherwise still cute without the bows,1
these shoes arw adorable and comfy if i could my size in black i would think i had found heaven size runs a wee bit large i ordered 12 size down and they are perfect,2
my son isnt even 2 months old and its already tight on him hes 9lbs and this is supposed to be 06 months he got to wear it once,0
the stones fall out of this bracelet the fell out before i had a chance to wear it i am disappointed in the poor quality of this product,0
the crotch is very low on these pants forcing me to take much smaller steps than i would normallybr br fine for playing in the snow with the kids but useless for outdoor sporting activities like hiking snowshoeing or skiing where you need full freedom of motionbr br its a shame because outside of the low crotch they are great pants as many pockets as you could desire great waterproofness and well insulated,1
could not get my foot through the bottom of the legbr and if i could have i am sure they would have been too shortbr the material was flimsy,0
some are not real nose piercings,1
i read the headline goiacii women leather wallet rfid blocking and thought the wallet was made out of leather my bad for not reading the description where it clearly states vegan leatherbr the wallet has a strong chemical smell looks and feels like plastic i am keeping it because whenever i am taking out my credit card to place an online order the smell and feel of the plastic wallet will hopefully remind me that i need to read the description,0
im a big guy and it fit around me a lot of space but not too bulky took it to disneyland fit all i needed inside of it,2
not as pictured look a lot cheaper,1
im a size 46 depending on the brand this dress was super tight and didnt even cover the chest youd need a tank top to wear with that looked somewhat like an apron very odd design,0
i ordered a 4 since we have a very tall 2 yr old but the dress just barely fits her now i ordered other size 4 cotton dresses that fit better from elsewherebr also after i washed item cold water cool dryer the fabric wrinkles badly it is cotton so i expected some but this is iron needed wrinkles plus the bottom hem curls up again iron needed i hate ironingbr i didnt return shell get a little wear from it its red i wanted for valentines day no time for new onebr it is very pretty so if you dont mind the wrinkles order larger than needed you should be fine,1
not a great variety of letters i only received 1 b 2 m 1 n 0 r 1 s etc but got 7 of x and 7 of z 10 of t i would think that i would get more qty of more popular letters,1
material was stretchy and comfortable i had no issues with it my fiance did tho but that was his problem,2
will not buy this again,0
i have purchased a few winthrop shoes recently because i like their quality my previous purchases were instore so i was able to wear it before buying the shoes i figured since this company has shoes that fit well for me ill be interested in buying a few other pairs to wear i found the winthrop augustine shoes on a massive sale during the holidays so i figured it was a good opportunitybr br i purchased both 9m us in black and cognac the augustine cognac one is slightly looser but acceptable compared to my winthrop phillips 9m us the phillips fit amazing the augustine black shoe on the other hand fits like a 10m us width 4e when looking at the sole its the same size but the stitching and shape of the shoe for some reason causes the fit to be extremely loose unfortunately i wore it outside to get a better feel of walking around so i will not be able to return the itembr br i will most likely donate the black pair because it is not worth wearing ill fitting shoes,1
a little biggerlonger than i wanted but works,1
so like others have said the strap is a little cheap and flimsy but it is still functional bag was bigger than i was expecting and kind of a light tan i have plenty of room to store my wallet makeup journal phone keys and glasses in it it is very well organized but i would say from a practicality point of view the main compartment is kind of a hassle to open and close beneath that flap though is a really cool magnetically closed compartment which is amazing i did not have an issue with smell or glue like others have reported all seems look good as well overall really nice looking and might be a good daily driver,2
looks more delicate in the picture,1
these are not for adults maybe for a toddler to wear so tiny you cannot hardly see them i returned them the same day they came in,0
this is super cute i wore it for almost 3 weeks straight and got lots of compliments but it broke yesterday i just ordered it again hoping for better luck this time,1
the ratcheting system was not included,1
this dress was cute but the fit didnt work for me it came just to my knees and im almost 5834 the fabric of the floral print was a heavy stretchy polyester and its a hot summer where i live so i returned it with no problem grateful for lots of shopping options and good return policies,1
smaller then i thought theyd be and one earring was broken had to use superglue to get it to stick together since this was a christmas present and i didnt have time to wait around for a refund or another pair to show up just hope my mom doesnt notice where i had to fix it,1
first of all it wasnt nearly as neat and smooth as pictured so i brushed it out which caused quite a bit of the hair to come out of it and still there were pieces sticking up on top very unattractively secondly you need to have a pretty small head for this to look good on you,0
bigger and less delicate than i was expecting but not enough to send them back,1
i bought this old school digital watch because i kept losing the chargers to smart watches it does count your steps but you can only see them from the app you also have to continually reconnect the watch to the app and i find it annoying any measurements are in metric and i dont think there is a way to change it,1
love russell athletic i bought this for my husband he has worn these hoodies for years these are made well run true to size they are not too warm great choice for chilly weather,2
smaller than advertized disappointed,1
fit well over glasses but scratched easily,1
no me agrado para nada,1
at first i tried to return it because i felt it was too small i lost a little weight and tried it out again and now i actually really love this esp with my faux leather leggings,1
a little bulky but should work as intended,2
glad i ordered 2,2
got this to replace one of my husband old watch band on his seiko watch and it is really nice very story material love the colors and the design is really nice my husband definitely approved of his new watch band,2
perfect keeps feet warm and dry and fit true to size light weight and easy to move on wore skiing and tubing for 3 hours and feet stayed warm and dry first pair had an eyelet missing and customer service was great and shipped a replacement very quickly,2
the mesh pockets could be a bit wider deeper,1
cheap material and bad fit,0
dream catchers fall off way to easy,0
non stick soles,1
i would recommend this product,2
i love everything kendra scott glad a friend talked me into this purchase they are surprisingly light weight and just fabulous,2
this is my 3rd same hoodie and i am sure not the last one it is water repellent and fleece inside but also it has ventilation as big holes around shoulders so you never gonna be wet,2
i ordered these yicool crew neck short sleeve tshirts in large for my wife who loves to customize all things these tshirts are a very clean white they are cotton and feel like cotton the stitching is a bit haphazard with the material folded under the stitch or crooked you an also see multiple sewing machine starts and stops they are slightly thinner than a higher quality tshirt they fit a bit smaller than expected my wife is 57 and wears a size 8 and these fit her perfectly normally a mens medium fits her the same way the short sleeves come to a perfect length they seem a bit longer than your average tshirt which my wife prefersbr when using htv they worked well the vinyl transferred well and she had no issues overall these are okay shirts to customizes for personal use but i would not recommend using them to customize and then sell,2
5 1034 at 165lbs and the large fit like a glove tons of compliments so i ordered another color the heart buttons are the cherry on top this dress was on another site for twice the price plus shipping happy i came across it here,2
extremely dissappointed that this stuff is on amazonbr this product can only be used oncebr once washed it loses it shape and becomes rather useless,0
i think this runs like a mans smallthey are hugeim about 110lbs,2
small,0
great sections for all your property,1
i was so excited to get this in i had bought two one for me and my bestie when they came in i was devastated i tried mine on it does not lay like the picture shows iam petite it looked like a 10 year old sewed it together and very misshaped my son even commented on it dont recommend,0
it was ok but not as flattering as some of the other popular suits of the season i really wanted to love this one and it just didnt do much for me the straps hit a bit too far in on my neck so they kind of rolled the back crept up on me im 58 so can have issues with one pieces being too short and didnt have anything in the lower belly area which is where i have my mom belly its too bad because i think its a really cute suit,1
love these shirts high quality fits great,2
i have some very mixed feelings about this bracelet while i like the appearance of it within minutes of putting it on my wrist started itching i have no allergies so i was surprised to get such a quick reaction to what should have been stone beads that i have worn many times before i put the bracelet aside for a couple of weeks before i tried again and once more within 10 minutes my wrist was red and itchybr br before tossing it in the trash and coming to write a scathing review i decided to give it one last shot and soaked the bracelet in warm soapy water overnight in the morning the water had a grey tinge something that should not have happened if the beads arent treated or covered in some sort of chemical after drying it off i tentatively tried it on again and to my surprise no itchingbr br this leads me to question just what was on the beads that caused this instant reaction on my skin i read all the other reviews searching to see if anyone else had a similar reaction and didnt find any mention of it however i can only review what i got which is a bracelet that made me itch every time i wore it until i cleaned it off i expect jewelry i purchase to be ready to wear when i get it without having to first clean off any chemical residue and rated my review accordingly the actual bracelet itself is fine about what id expect from a mid rangequality beaded braceletbr br i as offered this bracelet at no cost for evaluation and review all opinions are based on my own experiences using the product and are not influenced by the seller in any way,1
sunglasses are as shown but i only received two out of the three thats pictured not too happy,0
xtra large meansbr extra large look it up,1
good grip,1
by far one of they beat suites i have ever worn fast shipping and money well spent after a 30minute run i was completely drenched of sweat and it kept me very warm even though the weather was 52 degrees i highly recommend it for any type of use and super easy to wash,2
fit is nice shoe is fairly comfortable just a little hard to get into,1
like it but its a bit to large,1
i purchased a large and its like an extra small very disappointed and will be returning it,0
comfort quality and reliability great everyday watch,2
update may 2019 my fiance loved these sunglasses until they broke today she has seriously only wore them a total of 15 times they are always kept in case or in the built in visor case inside her truck she went to put them on today and black plastic fell off of them near the silver metal piece on left side of framethe plastic that fell off was surrounding the two tiny screws that hold the side ear piece to the frame upon inspection it appears both sides are doing the same rendering the glasses broken and unable to be worn i paid too much money for these for her to only be able to get approx 15 wears out of them since late nov 2018 when i got them for her due to this the the stars get knocked down to 1 star these are obviously not the quality we thought they werebr br very nice sunglasses bought these for my fiancee and she loves them they look good and block the sun very well the quality seems nice they came with a hard case soft case and a very nice cleaning cloth i would buy again,0
what a sad hat it came to me literally all bent out of shape and wrinkly on top when i put it on the brim looked silly because of the permanent folds on itbr br i consider my head average size i own lots of hats and never had a problem with it fitting i even got one from the dollar store that fit just fine not in this case the hat is snug around the rim and makes me think it might give me a headache if i wear it for too long do yourself a favor and skip this one,0
this is a great basic tshirt and i feel that it fits true to size it has a little stretch to it as well if you need to stretch it a little i am plus size and like things a little baggie and this was pretty long on me when i ordered a 4xl i normally would be fine with that but i am starting to build confidence to wear things that fit me a little better instead of as if im trying to hide something im going to purchase a size smaller which i think i will feel more comfortable with,2
shiny vivid colors added the keychain to a standard sized key ring and fit very well lightweight and smooth words are centered and easy to read and says exactly what i wanted it to very happy with the purchase if it holds up well i will buy one each year,2
edit just realized this is for women guys dont let the girls have all the fun im a male ski patroller and this thing keeps me warm for hours on shift super soft love it kids are always snagging it its a family fav for cold daysbr br its tight enough to stay up but wont go inside your mouth when pulled up over your face kept me warm in 0f temps with a 15f windchill for 23 hours while snowboarding its thick enough so it wont freeze your breath and its not noticeably wet either like some thinner buffsgaiters its super soft my wife wants to steal it i can tell the inside tag is sewn on by two threads making it super easy to remove without damaging,2
pendant very thin and light looks cheap,1
such a fun sweater perfect for the holidays i got quite a few compliments it is unfortunate that you cannot turn off the lights i went to a movie theater while wearing it and had to wear a thick jacket,2
man i wanted to love these so much they would have been perfect except they stunk coming out of the package i had this happen with another brand of similar styled pants and washed them 7 times before finally giving up on them and tossing in the trash i did not want to waste my money on these so just returned them instead of washing,0
these are so comfortable easy wearing shorts i have received many compliments when wearing,2
right crocs is smaller than left one,0
i purchased this to wear while at a breast cancer walk i wanted to make certain that i wasnt to hot or too cold while walking when it arrived i immediately noticed that it was not the color that was advertised i picture shows a deep neon pink like a fuchsia i received pink but not the one advertised,1
i loved this and i still love it except it didnt last long ripped at the seam i am returning it to have it replaced hoping the second times a charm,0
i absolutely love these theyre rustic and chic i love the brushed brass look some people complain about it looking bad its really not the wood is comfortable no sharpness very smooth fits well the edges are not big stays in my ears these are great,2
nice and thick and warm the flat sole is comfortable and good for outdoor walks really nice quality slipper i took away 1 star for sizing they run small my heel hangs over the back 12 inch i recommend buying up 1 size,2
im 50 135lbs i bought the medium and im very happy with the fit most leggings are too long for me but these fit just right maybe an inch or two above the ankle they are a little bit tight in the belly but im planning on losing some weight there so im good with the fit not so tight its uncomfortable,2
love it,2
i loved them when i first put them on and wore them the first day then i washed them now theyre short and even tight at the bottom what a disappointment,0
great little dress,1
i injured my foot and now find out years of wearing high heels and doing lots of exercise have created a condition called mortons neuroma i dont like most orthotic shoesbut i am so lucky because fit flops are not only beautiful but i can wear them in comfort i am addicted to them i have read other reviewers and i am finding out they are a national addiction these are wonderful beautiful and in a gorgous neutral shade,2
i dont get it this is supposed to be a summer weight shirt but the nylonpolyester blend cooks me in the sun even with the vented design it looks good fits as expected but i cant comfortably wear it over 70 degrees i have other sweatwickingcooling shirts with similar fabric but for some reason this one doesnt perform like those other brands i can wear it in spring or fall but thats not the season i purchased it for sigh,0
your silouette will not be good but comfy to sleep in or clean house in and the price is right,1
love it,2
they are cute however i ordered a 7 my usual size and these were about a size too big they are not well made at all they scratched my calf and are irritating the right foot the zipper had no openings it was sewn shut you would have to unlace the entire thing to remove it if you have big claves these are definitely not for you unless you get different laces for them,1
love my robe but its a bit too big,1
i got these headbands for trail running and hiking ive tried a lot of different bands and i usually end up frustrated as they end up falling off my head while physically active these bands are nearly the best ive tried they stay put and they keep me plenty warm sometimes i get too hot with a hat and these bands are a great alternativebr br the colors and styles of these are great i love that they come in a pack of three different styles and colors the price for all 3 is great price and well worth it i was able to keep a couple for myself and gift another to a fellow trail running pal she loves hers as well there is nothing i dont like so i cant really talk about the cons on these overall i will definitely order these again if i lose mine on the trail which im known to do,2
they are very pretty and fit nicely a little worried they may not last long but definitely happy with them,2
i bought this in a darker color and loved it this one was too thin and too sheer you can see right through it the fit was good just too seethrough,1
i can only use slip ons and i am only using these because i cant find anything else they dont have good support and just become a bit sloppy after a bit i use them a slippers,1
great do rag,2
this tshirt is made of a soft fabric that feels good and is lightweight and comfortable the top i received looks exactly like the one pictured but i didnt take my photos with the shirt tucked in as in the listing photos it does look better if it is partially tucked in the front this shirt appears to be made well with all the seams being doublestitched overlock stitch and the fabrication looks like a standard jersey knit it has a nice amount of stretch and best of all it fits great it also has a side slit at the bottom of each side seam the label says to hand wash but i pretty much wash all my tops on cold delicate and hang them up immediately to dry this one included it washes on delicate finebr br i ordered a small and used a sewing tape to take the actual measurements of the garment with it lying on a flat surface in case the measurements might help with your purchasing decision for reference model is 56 112 lbsbr br chest 1825 365 46355 9271 cmbr length from high point shoulder 2575 6541 cmbr sleeve length 35 889 cmbr sleeve opening 9375 23812 cmbr armhole 10 20 254 508 cmbr neck opening 105 21 2667 5334 cmbr side slits 4625 1174 cmbr br overall this is a nice casual top that can be worn with almost anything tucked in or left out reasonably priced,2
nice,2
i purchased this watch for myself rather than for a child as i needed an inexpensive watch to wear around the house i love the bright colors and opted for the neon green and black i have a fairly large wrist 65 1651 cm and find the watch fits very comfortably without being too tight or binding the band is smooth and slim so it doesnt restrict my movements when working around the house i dont wear it when showering but feel safe when it gets wet while working in the kitchen or cleaning the house even when watering and working with my plants it was simple and intuitive to set the time and alarm watch for the p in the upper left corner if using ampm rather than military time and i love the stopwatch function when exercising so far it has worked perfectly maintaining the time and alarm setting without problem i also find the lighted screen helpful especially when i have to get up at night to assist my disabled husband although i use it as little as possible in order to extend the battery life for the watch overall im very happy with this purchase and find it a great value for the price,2
loved it awesome seller,2
the size is not true to size the fabic is stiff,0
my daughter is almost 2 and wanted me to take it off right away if i had a painting project out i probably wouldve had a better response it was very large on her the product needs to off gas a bit i am keeping it and look forward to using it i wish it had a more adjustable size,1
i like product i dislike the size its too tight made for small heads,0
love the style but poor quality fabrics,1
perfect lightweight robe very soft and comfortable,2
someone told me its worth it to spend the extra money and get teva or chaccos they were right these were hurting my feet where there plastic triangle is towards the front of the sandal so i bought some tevas and dont have any issues now too bad because these look great and i love the pattern,1
very loose and baggy one size fits all but they are way too loose for me the material is a strange brush d cotton that feels like a chamois for washing your car,0
love this on my granddaughter and she is 1 12,2
cute enough not great but ok a little too short i should have gone up a size three more words,1
very cutenice quality,2
it was not bright like the pictures im pissed,0
this not only goes w my bathing suit its perfect for what i wanted glad i got it,2
runs very small,0
pa todo,1
i very much liked it only problem was i ordered the wrong size extra large instead of large,0
it was not a dress it is a shirt,0
very cute but see thru in some lighting very embarrassing to not be informed of this until after 8 hours of my 10 hour shift,1
after actually receiving the correct product i was sent the wrong thing at first i was very satisfied with this purchase the earrings are gorgeous they are classically beautiful not gaudy at all they are the perfect size and honestly you cant even tell they arent real best 6 ive ever spent im wearing them now and have been for weeks you will be happy with these stunning sparkling earrings,2
the biggest issue i have with this is that the straps are sewn into the bag without 34d34 rings they are so stiff they are always standing straight up in the air i cant tell you how many times i was sitting and went to get something out of the purse only to have the closest strap 34slap34 me in the face when im in the store and set it down on the counter to fetch my wallet the same things happens i was hoping theyd soften up but they havent never would have even thought that could be an issue its a serious design flaw and a shame because i really love this purse,1
the cups were just too big,0
the design is adorable the ring is holding up pretty well with the exception of the stones four of them have fallen out,1
these silicone bracelets are comfortable and informative you can wear them all day long while youre in the shower or sleeping very convenient,2
way bigger than expected,1
love how great they wash and wear they are made extremely well and great quality materials they are by far the best fitting scrubs ive worn,2
great shirt for st bernard owner,2
too small and its more for a child then a women of average size,1
the product description should have emphasized that the upper material of the shoe was wool cloth i cannot imagine wearing this shoe and where there was a slight possibility of rain or snow very fragile shoes unless you are never going outside of your home will these shoes workbr not shoes for me,0
did not fit anklets should have longer chains,0
love how the boots fit,2
i wear this ring everyday it rarely catches lint from my pocket this ring is hold up to any and all conditions of my day to day life i love it i wanted a ring that will hold up and this one does the job,2
quality seemed ok but it was smaller and shorter than expected i returned it,1
not very windproof one strong wind and now it doesnt seem to work anymore,1
it is not cotton,1
these were too large and gaudy for my taste from the pictures online i thought they would be delicate im so disappointed i cant return them for something on a smaller scale buyer beware pay attention to whether or not an item can be returned im stuck with this purchase,0
beautiful and comfortable socks,2
great,2
looks good on for the price,2
small would for a child sent back,0
i really like the color the fabric and the way this fits the teal is a very nice teal color its not terribly seethrough and the fabric is soft stretchy and slinky like i like it the sleeves are a nice length as well not too short and the v is low but not scandalously sobr that said the first time i work it there was a very small hole that isnt terribly noticeable and i wear it under a sweater since they keep the office where i work as cold as a morgue in the front and im worried it might get bigger im not 100 percent certain i didnt do it although it was there the first time i wore it so if i did it must have been very easy i have washed it twice and its not getting biggerbr that said for the price its pretty wellmade and i would consider getting another one to wear,2
product arrived ontime and in good condition this is a very nice shoe and exactly what i was looking for in a casual slipon tennis style shoe for around the house and backyard although i ordered an extrawide the shoe is still much too narrow and i am not able to wear these shoes i will return them for a refund as it does not appear that they offer a shoe that comes in a wider fit,1
very sheer fit was a bit weird the length and the width did not complement each other not at all like pic,0
fabric sheds a lot but theyre okay biggest problem is quality of the cinch string first one broke immediately ordered replacement which chafed immediately otherwise i liked them so bought some black shoestring and replaced the original strings time consuming theyre fine now,0
so i read the reviews before buying order a size up im usually a medlarge but i went with a xl and its a perfect fit,2
i was really disappointed when i got them in the mail because they didnt fit i always wear a size 9 but these made my toes squished at the very end and i think its the fleece ling that causes them to run small i really need a 9 and a half but they only sell whole sizes so i had to return them they looked to be sturdy and attractive but just dont fit im looking for a different style all together because i dont want the next size up which is a 10,1
perfect size love the compartments,2
thase are a lot smaller and thinner than i imagined it is quite difficult to use because the holes are so small the are nice looking though i just wish they were bigger i will probably use them as hair accessories instead,1
the quality of the tutu is really good nice materials very flowy yet the right amount of 34poof34 had i been trying to purchase this for my adult size 6 daughter this product would have gotten 5 starsbr br unfortunately i was buying it for me couldnt get the xxl past my upper knees measure measure measure before you buybr br btw my daughter loves it and is planning to wear it for 34spirit week34 ill update with pictures soon,1
the bottoms fit perfectly and were great to wear i wear a 36d and the top was way too small luckily i was only looking for a bottom when i ordered this so i was happy with it overall,1
warm and cozy but looks and feels kinda cheap,1
so pretty and just the size i wanted,2
small but i knew that based on other comments when purchased really cute though,2
material very flimsy see through the material clings to my body like static electricitybr returned refunded without incident,0
it works well and looks good enough on the wallbr but the finish is some plastic stick on junk not cherry finished wood but it does seem well appliedbr for the price it is ok but the description is misleading,1
very cheap polyester material,1
these hornz sunglasses look good whether you are looking at them or through thembr br considering the selling price these are a super deal and a 5 star value i cannot really tell much difference between these glasses and similar products from the 34big name34 brands that sell for way way more than these the quality of the optics fit finish etc all seem to be the samebr br the wraparound design is good for visibility and blocking stray light that would otherwise come in around the frames the portion of the temple piece which goes over the ear is very flexible and springy resulting in good comfort and of course the camo pattern gives a great and stylish look the optics are clear and without noticeable distortionbr br my 18 year old son really really likes these so either he is going to end up with these or im going to have to buy him a pairbr br i was very fortunate to receive a discount on these hornz sunglasses in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review if you have any questions about my comments or this item please let me know by posting a reply ill do my best to respond promptly,2
great shade in our backyard for the arizona summers,2
cute gold plated earrings so far i have not had any allergic reaction like i usually do to jewelery that isnt gold or silver but i have only been wearing these for about a week the posts are normal length not baby size and would fit an adult fine,2
my mother in law is tiny she is 54 and weighs 92 pounds i bought a small for her and it looked like it was a child size there is some stretch to it but i would definitely order a size or two up,1
zip was put together badly couldnt zip up had trouble siping down in the first place the cup placement was off and way to small so disappointed,0
material and stiching was good but the pants were quite tight on the thighs and below waistband for a normal not husky 12year old returned,1
i am not crazy the right shoe is roomier than the left one,1
i ordered these baby glasses with other items and havent received them it says that they got here but when i opened the packages they were not included this is unusual and im not sure what to do about it,0
these are a great casual sandal the price is great great comfort and fit,2
i wanted to like this skirt however i was expecting canary yellow and what i got was light orange also the waist band wasnt as flattering on me as i wanted it was a little tighter than i prefer even thought the shortsskirt part fit comfortably i ordered a medium and am an athletic 55 133lbs,1
they feel much cheaper than expected they are still cute though,1
im a short person 53 and im disappointed that the sleeves are about an inch above my wrist instead of actually to my wrists or preferably slightly past my wrists ive been wanting a robe for myself for several years now but never indulged on it until now ordering on amazon since i wasnt able to find what i was wanting locally ill be keeping it just still not exactly what i had been wanting,1
was a gift my friend loves it,2
broke after 3 days looked nice though,0
too bulky,1
terrible quality plastics beds very easily and the plastic sticks dont stay straight would not recommend this product,0
ok but not what i had hoped just a little too large for carryon making it bulky and stiff for carrying through airport stiff works for bags with wheels but this does not ordered too close to travel date so needed to use and couldnt return,0
i got the 3x and theyre a bit too small 3x is supposed to fit somewhere around 4834 waist as small as 4434 as large as 5034 or so i wear 4434 waist pants and these boxers are very smalltight i wouldnt recommend the 3x size for anyone over 3834 as youll just feel very uncomfortable the fabric isnt great either as its thin and stiff,0
nice fit lite weight does the job thank you,2
i really wanted to love this but unfortunately it felt cheap and the lace top doesnt lay flat either on my sides or on the top see picturesbr br its also very small like petite small im tall and so the hemline is way too high unless you wear a slip also the model looks busty but it doesnt fit like that if you actually have a bust,0
these are a nice style but theyre cheap plastic and kept coming out of my cuffs because the moving part is too loose,0
absolute trash very disappointed in this purchase nowhere in the description does it mention the cheap thin plastic this badge is constructed of my distain primarily stems from it being grotesquely overpriced what you get would be more in line with a 99 cent price tag if you have money to burn and just need something that looks good from afar to complete your cowardly lion costume it will do the trick,0
these are pretty but the earings are a little bit bigger then i thought the necklace is perfect sized i havent worn them yet im it sure if im keeping them for myself or giving them away for a gift ill update my review if my opinion changes after being worn by myself or someone elsebr shipping did take awhile bc they come from china but i knew ahead of time and i did receive them 3 weeks sooner then the estimated end date,1
i bought 4 sets these so 48 total ordered 10apr delivered 16apr strong chemical smell that easily washed away i used the hottest water sanitary mode heavily soiled settings to make sure the smell was neutralized they were as clean and as shrunk as i could get them i used unscented proprietary soap and half a cap of gain fireworks scent beadsbr br for the dryer i set it on the highest heat and most dry no dryer sheet just 2 trusty woolen dryer orbs the amount of lint in the trap from 48 brand new cotton squares was impressive less than half had sewn edges so they frayed mightilybr br as i intend to make masks from this cloth it was second verse same as the first they all went through a second round of full heat full sanitation full dryingbr br the amount of lint appeared slightly less yet the deep harsh wrinkling got out of hand some reminded me of an accordian and there were three that had selfpleated so completely that it ended up as a 1 13 wide strap that ill have to iron flat by hand along with each of the other 47 as each one has deep set wrinkling covering at least 15 of each squarebr br as for fraying the ones not cut on the bias did okay but the straight cuts are a little nightmarebr br this fabric isnt nearly as thick as an american bandana and its not as soft either because my patterns call for several layers plus added interfacing which will add softness smoothness and additional filtration this fabric still works for me although i will be grumbling about all of that ironing i made sure to pull the fabric straight from the dryer to avoid this to no availbr br is it cotton i cannot say for certain yet thats what im calling it pure synthetic fabrics like polyester do not shrink these shrank easily they arrived as promised being 22 x 22br br after two long trips through the hottest water and hottest dryer i pulled a random sample from one that didnt suffer some fraying 1975 x 195br br the shrinkage made them a tiny bit thicker but still not to traditional bandana thickness i can still read a label through one of these with no extra lighting after the washings they are a little bit softer but still not to what one may expect with the word bandana in its descriptionbr br for making healthconscious multifiltered washable masks that i will beef up to spec one by one these still are good for my use although they are requiring far more extra work on the outsetbr br if you cant find this type of cut fabric elsewhere at a decent price and need it for masks these can fill the need just know it requires some work upfront that you may not have expectedbr br good luck yall,1
second purchase originally purchase the blue version quality tee love the fender graphics fit great,2
this too is cute and i love the cropped fit and the button detail however i have a problem with the book and eye closure across the chest area staying closed and occasionally i have found myself inadvertently flashing people i am going to try adding a small snap to help keep it closed,1
gorgeous roomy but flattering this is a musthave fast shipping,2
i was disappointed because one wire was bent correctly and the other was straight across and the end of it was bent up also on there a piece of the gold plating was chipped off in the middle of the wire i think someone should check items before they are shipped out needless to say im sending them back,0
great gloves my 7 year old loves the colors and patterns on the grippers great for playing on the playground he will probably lose a few pairs by the time winter is over its nice to have a few spares,2
hat is a much darker green color,1
cute love them,2
the material is thin and the dress looks like a shirt,0
i love my watch it goes with everything and i wear it all the time i have bathed with it several times and it works perfectly i want to find it in the other colors,2
very comfortable and looks great,2
i have two other pairs of telic shoes and they fit these are too big and i trip on thembr the other pairs are small and not small medium,0
i have been looking for these since sears discontinued them my husband has diabetes and a progressive neuromuscular disease these socks make it possible for him to put on independently they are not very thick but us in california with mild weather they are perfect not restriciting at all yet stay up,2
good quality and fit,2
i always wanted a watch with a clip because it more useful to me than a wrist watch the price was fair and i liked the design and colors the only thing about the product is the minute and hour hand on the clock are blue and red plastic not metal the watch is very small and its very light even with the battery which was included my personal con is having to pull the ears apart in order to open the watch i thought there would be a switch to do that for me outside of that i have no other major concerns,1
very cute son loves it,2
the watch is just like i remember them when i was young it was a little uncomfortable but that could be because i dont wear watches that much very cute but i returned it,2
i ordered these hoping for a comfortable bralette that i could use during my postpartum stage im currently a 40d and i ordered an xl the cups fit fine but the side boning is crazy uncomfortable when sitting as it rolls up and in and the band that should lay flat under your breast also rolls up when sitting and is uncomfortable the 4 hooks are very difficult to latch somehow once there are more than 3 eye hook latches it gets to be a pain i tried an extender to see if it would make the bra more comfortable but all the same issues remained i realize i am overweight and have extra fluff going on so i think if i was in better shape then it would fit great i just feel that of youre a certain size or shape this bralette will not work even if you order the size you need super bummed since these are cute and affordable i might try a smaller size once im back to a post partum size with less flab around my top half these do seem to run small but again if youre a certain shape they probably wont be very flattering or comfortable regardless of the size you order,1
love these pants so comfortable do not use as pajamas i wear around house and out love them,2
very nice material and cool for summer heat,1
fabric is cotton but super thin,1
its light weight with nice stitching and seemed decent but i returned it because i didnt feel comfortable paying 40 for it cheap chinese feel to it hard to describe get it and youll know what im talking about also it kinda poofed out around the stomach and slimmed at the chest shoulders should be the other way around,1
super cute hat fits both my 2yearold and 4yearold perfectly i ordered a 24 size and a 48 size but i received two 48 sizes didnt matter as this is pretty much one size fits all for little heads,2
not true to size,0
the sizing is small i ordered size 5 and the top is too smalltight for my 4 year old grandchildbr otherwise it is cute,1
not good too short,0
super cute the suit covers up all tummy issues and is comfy and fits well,2
these shoes seem to have very flexible thin soles and they are very uncomfortable to me no arch support,1
i purchased this jacket of my sons birthday he loved it and was sad when the weather warmed up and i made him put it away the only con he found is that there was not a inside pocket other than that we were pleased with the jacket and he will be able to wear it another winter,2
the zipper was broken it wouldnt unzip the lace was tattered i wouldnt recommend this item at all in fact the picture is so not like the dress,0
very realistic appearance loved it,2
it was a little snug especially compared to a similar dress i had just purchased in a different color the material was also different i sent it back,1
came broken,0
i loved the shoe but way too wide and way too long,0
the left and right side graphics of this hoodie does not line up when its zipped up sizing is off for us based on other reviews i ended up ordering multiple sizes at the same time to get correct sizing,0
i learned my lesson dont order anything on amazon thats arrives direct from china paper thin chinsey cheap material sizes are not based on americans beware gave it to charity,0
does not look as good as its photobr quality is below par,1
love this sweater super cozy and fits me perfectly will order again,2
very nice compact slim design and light weight travel friendly so has automatic shut off so you dont waste battery i would gladly buy again and give some as gifts,2
adorable i love it it came in a sparkly diamond shape box i havent worn it yet it says 925i might have to get a thicker chain for it other than that its perfect and beautiful,2
these were not stretchy they hugged my thighs which made the crotch area poof out i have a butt and thighs so this was a terrible fit it didnt flow off my legs,0
very big but great otherwise at keeping the rain out,1
these are regular size folks maybe they are xl in china where there were made,1
i liked the soft fabric of these shorts the price was right so i grabbed a couple pair theyre great to sleep in also,2
the breast area needs more material i have to wear a tank underneath and i wish the length was an inch or so longer because i have thick thighs and butt,1
way too stiff for the wrist,0
the amber glass bottle is very nice the sprayer works well also which was a surprise to me im very pleased i will buy again,1
pattern is beautiful and styling is very flattering however the material is cheap polyester without the weight and structure of the sheath dresses aka meterologist dress if the material had been the same as the sheath dress this would have been a keeper,1
i bought six pairs and they are great socks just ordered six more pairs they look great and feel really comfortable with tennis shoes or hiking boots highly recommend,2
good tool easy to use store and carry around big time saver good buy ballerina all should get them trust me,2
if came in a size or two bigger would be better to small in package area otherwise feel great but uncomfortable,1
broke right away,1
unlike previously purchased russell sweat suits this one seems to fall apart when i take it off the floor around me and my socks are covered with pieces of fabric pills i think they are called most annoying i do like the feel of the outer material,0
i got this in green leaf and it looks different the colors are a bit off and i dont really like it its just not me i also feel like i could find this for 999 at a discount store,1
returned item because it looks worn with no label cut out fits very small fabric is ok ink stain on front as well,0
they switched to mesh which i dont like but hey cant beat the price and they hold up just like other cloth diapers,1
the pictures of item seemed different from product the size of stones were much larger than i expected or wanted,1
recommended by a friend who likes to hike these socks caused calouses on big toes small size purchased for a 512 size shoe they are fine for wearing while shopping or walking neighborhood but would not use them on a long hike or a 5k,2
i like the tie but after about 25 times of wearing it im starting to notice fraying,2
loved it wears everywhere well made well worth the price,2
this outfit looks nice and washes well but seems to run small also the seam of the shorts began to come apart the first time my son wore them,1
glasses were not tight on the face and always kept sliding off,0
love it the leather is plush works well i will update after a period of time i will be using this as a work belt so look for my update to see if thus belt holds up,2
gorgeous bracelet i received so many compliments i just wish it wouldve been made a little sturdier after wearing the bracelet quite a few times over a 5 month period one of the starfish arms cracked and broke off be gentle with this for longer use,1
it saved me during an interview recently so i cant complain too much but the design seems a little clunky the stictching is wavy and the padding is thick and noisey sounds like armpit diapers but these are only noticible without an over shirt once you have a bitton up over it its fantastic this is not meant to be worn alone itll look rediculous undershirt purposes only,2
so disappointing i love the style of these shoes and they do offer great support but even though i have very narrow thin feet these are too small the depth at the top of this shoe is so small even my feet do not fit it scrapes my toes and is uncomfortable i do love this brand and will continue my search for something similar,0
fits a bit larg fabric feels very cheap,0
sizing way off and material is cheap,0
i was sceptical on the accuracy and am pleasantly surprised how awesome this watch is great value for money,2
these are great for toddlers who ask for sunglasses but break them constantly etc cute and do the job and many of them so you can not worry when they break them while playing with them this has happened after my purchasing many expensive sunglasses and finally i found qty was a real selling point these dont seem to break too quickly just mentioning because this was my impetus to buy them,2
my favorite comfortable great quality and stylish watch band had to buy the black one too,2
dont buy,0
good quality tie,2
thin material and a strange neckline almost like a mans cheap undershirt neckline,1
broke first day,0
nice shirt but cut too short i like the color and feel of the shirt but its too short for me and i have to return it no way it would stay in a pair of pants when tucked in,1
great socks,2
great cobalt blue color great design especially loved how it went a bit longer in the back but it was a tad too small for me it clung to my problem area of the stomach and obviously would probably get a bit smaller once washed so returned immediately since the fit was fairly close i did not order the next size up as that would surely be too loose,2
dislike how fast it stretched out to where its always needing to be pulled up to keep nose covered,1
love this sweater it fits amazing and is not itchy,2
i was surprised at the quality of both the material and the workmanship very comfortable and drapes very wellbr thank you will buy it again,2
this band is nice and light to wear however it hasnt held up well over time the finish has worn off in places and the magnet slips,1
see headline,2
it is hit or miss with dockers they have a ton of stylesyou just never know what you get when you order here sometimes ill buy these and they fit perfectly other times too tight stillother times the legs are so huge they look like clown pants theres a quality problem on sizing with dockers,0
they get the job done other tank tops of this nature i wear a l however i should have gone with an xl for these,1
does not remotely look like the picture very cheaply made buyer beware,0
it was too small,0
the are cute boots but wearing for anymore than 3 hours and you are gonna be hurting i put an insole in and they are still barely tolerable but sometimes you just dont have money for docs,1
fabric is thinner than i thought it would be,1
super cute design and the material is nice and stretchy but its way more body fitted than i wanted for a long sleeve shirt order up,1
i ordered these for hubby in several colors the navy blue were not sized right so i returned this pair ordered another pair of the gray ones,0
this runs small i had to return it was so small,0
this is a much more elegant way to wear your fitbit tracker i bought one in silver too,2
i was somewhat disappointed the picture in front is not where near as vivid otherwise it is a nice bag,1
i loved how big these were i bought them for when i had hand surgery they were great until i washed and dried them wow did they shrink at least 5 inches in length and shrunk from the top down as well i still wear them but i would never buy them again,1
so thin and see through material,1
runs small if your wide order a larger size,1
these are pretty and comfy i ended up walking 3 miles in the heat one day and i dont reccomend that but its not the shoes fault im out of shape they were still good and i wore them again the next day nice enough for work casual enough for day to day excellent choice at a good price,2
just amazing love it great job guys,2
happy with the hat good fit,2
nice,2
very thin material not sure how well it will hold up to many washes,1
this was a gift for another person and i loved it so much i bought an additional one for myself its beautiful and of great quality,2
decent budget top nice color,2
not true size is too small and poor quality,0
shirt was the coolest for little guy he was able to wear it and be stylish all at the same time washed it once and dry it didnt shrink either so quality is good as well,2
these shorts are a typical well made levi product i bought them for summer garden use and they do the job,1
really large more for large head or small toddler some of my came with smushed feathers,2
perfect fit,2
the material isnt stretchy enough but they work well enough for under shirts im just not a huge fan of how they fit,1
had to return run smsll,1
i really wanted to like these the picture looks great but once i received and tried them on their is no cushion whats so ever and you say for the price what do you expectwell any certified fashionista will tell you that isnt always a valid excuse for a bad purchase these sandals are cute but you will hurt yourself trying to wear them the straps are very loose maybe if you have wide feet yet the soles are like walking on bricks and they are very hard on the bottom of your feet,1
half of these earrings were not a true match i literally cant wear half of these,0
has been returnedproduct did not look like picture on website,0
pretty dress i would have kept it but it is see pretty much see through and as it is summer i didnt want to have to wear a slip underneath,1
looks great online but in live it is a cheap looking purse and does have a little smell to it that has nothing to do with real leather,0
this cami dress fit too small and rides up when i wear a dress over it i wont buy it again i know better than to buy a 1sized clothing item from now on,0
can wear with jean and dress pants fit perfectly comfortable i wear them often to work and on week ends,2
did not receive the correct size,0
i hate these i washed them once before wearing and they are so rough to the touch that i never feel like reaching for them again,0
bought this item 2 times and each time its started falling apart after a couple of months the pouch fits my ipad perfectly but the straps do tend to loosen up some on their own it could definitely be better,1
i love that these are overalls so that leaves extra room for any potential weight changes over the years and layering also i played in the snow with these and they kept me warm,2
im a woman and i have a smaller face these are huge for reading glasses theres no looking over them and theyre quite heavy,0
the necklace is very pretty but it tangles up around my neck alot kind of a pain to wear because it just starts eventually choking me the longer i wear,1
i ordered a size xl according to the bust measurement in the description it fit a bit smaller than other shirts i have with the same measurementsbr it also is fitted a bit more than the picture appears it has a slight taper from the bust to the hips not nearly as loose as the picturethe material was not as soft as i expected since it was a cottonpoly blend it feels more like a lightweight sweater i will definitely need shapewear under it,1
confirm received,1
love that it is slightly padded,2
very thin and runs smallbr im 55 150 and l is waay too tight,0
the product is poorly made the fabric is see through the back side of the shirt i received was completely unraveled hanes quality is not what it used to be be,0
dark navy is seethrough which is not good,0
super cute bought this for the grand nephew size looks true to fit and quality made not to mention adorable it is appropriate for a boy or a girl,2
the shirt was cute fabric wasnt thin like i was worried about and it fit my sister perfectly the print was nice and clear,2
i love the style of the dress and the look of the dress but the length was way too long and i am 5 8,1
they run a little small otherwise fabric is breathable and good for working out,1
it really does look cheap but its fine for the few times ill be wearing it,1
these shoes look cool but the design is very awkward they are difficult and unsafe for little ones to walk in toes stick out on each side in the front with an average foot i dont recommend these even if they are offered at a discount its a waste of money,0
i rarely comment but i loved this light but not see through my skin in sensitive and this was soft love it,2
way too long im 5 foot so im used to things needing some work but this is crazy long,1
i have had the fitbit flex one charge and surge flex was ok one was good charge has bad battery life and the surge had the dimmest screen ever i was using the one when the blaze was announced and just recently returned the apple watch i saw the blaze and thought when can i get one the blaze looked amazing and i was confused by the negative press it got well now i know in person its not as striking and the band and the removable watch face look put together compared to the seamless apple watch the watch it self is large but the bezel is so big you lose a lot of valuable real estate in fact the face you can choose 34pop34 doesnt fit on the screen it looks very cartoonish the watch faces are bland and uninspired for 200 you get the fitstar program on the watch i have these apps on my phone so i wont use this just like the ones on my phone you also get texts and music control once you start the music then you can skip and pause and raiselower the volume i found the volume control quite by accident by playing with buttons as there no instructions with he watch everything is onlinei didnt get all the text notifications and it only does texts no emojis or pictures are supported you cant answer texts either just read them the screen looks nice if this screen was on the surge i would still have that one the regular pedometer features steps flights sleep tracking are here and seem to work good it seems like fitbit is more interested in selling bands with this particular watch so ill return it and see if they cant come out with a more polished product,0
this is a great set of 3 items for the price,2
i like the style of the hat its a good fit and fairly is comfortable it did a bit longer than expected on the delivery but i dont think the seller was the issue in any case i intend to purchase a few more hats from here,2
these pearls are far more beautiful than i expected no flaws and as a gift for my daughterinlaw they were a hit,2
i really wanted to keep this suit but i had to return it due to issues with the fit of the chest i ordered a size 1012 the size 2xl which is my normal size the bottoms were a little loose but fine the top was the issue it fit perfect except the bust was a bit too small im a 36d so i didnt expect issues but there just wasnt any support up top and i knew if i kept the suit i would have been constantly adjusting it while wearing was really cute covered all my imperfections and i really wish i could have kept it getting a bigger size isnt an option the top actually fit perfect except for the bust part,1
runs large sleeves go past my wrist not fitted i usually wear size small im 53 130 pounds the collar flaps on the chest show the inside stitches for this type of style its poorly designed the belt fits snugly right above my waist so i think xsmall would be too high to the chest ive had better finds than this the sleeves bother me the most the material is thick and good quality but not the type to keep you warm,1
my dad loved it,2
i received by bag today i love it great size quality it out did my expectations i will be ordering another,2
today is about my 4th or 5th day wearing the ring sat down at the computer this morning and noticed the turquoise gem is gone,0
no where near xl ill stick to jockey and evolv,0
this cardigan is absolutely lovely it fits true to size its soft cozy very comfortable and keeps me warm the cheerful winter design brings out holiday cheer the sleeves are not overly long and end at the wrists the asymmetrical collar design make it look elegant despite its holiday motif i love wearing it 100 acrylic hand wash,2
parts of this shirt ig into the skin,1
just your average tote bag i bought it for work but should have gotten something a little more durable with pockets for my cell phone got what i paid for more of a beach bag def not for the office,0
small and no stretch dont buy if you have hips,1
nice fabric and seems really comfy but it fit me like a tent maybe it would have worked with a belt but even then didnt want to try that im 56 and 145 and i have some curves and this just fit me horribly,1
i needed something lightweight and comfortable for my daughter but warm enough to to get through the cold mornings my daughter loves this its been the perfect for texas mornings,2
great product,2
wish i could give this less than 1 star this arrived in the mail yesterday it fits less than a typical 2 strap backpack but that is to be expected the strap that goes across the body has a plastic claspbuckle that allows the wearer to remove it from the front rather than pull it over your head every time you take it off the clasp broke on the way to the first day of school this morning to sum up our experience with this backpack it arrived yesterday we packed it last night it broke on the way to school this morning epic fail do not buy this bag,0
stones are super small they dont take up even half of the hole pics depict the stone should almost fill it waste of money,0
exactly as advertised the wife enjoyed getting then as a gift to wear now that we have a boat i designated her the captain,2
super cute outfits i bought both the 03 month boy 1824 month girl the 03 month onsie and hat fit great the pants were just a little large 1 month old about 10 lbs the girls skirt was way too long the pictures make it seem as if the skirt might be knee length but it was to my daughters ankles 16 months old 22 lbs and about 30 in tall,1
it is rough in the color of the rockbr it is uncomfortable to feel something that can stuck in itfood gum etcbr horrible i just tried and i dont like it,0
i love these sweatshirts i got a halloween one too and they are the softest cozziest freaking sweatshirts ever the only thing i will point out is that they are not hoodies but there is an oversized neck which is actually so super amazing and cozy anyway i need these in nonholiday format so i can wear them for longer,2
this belt fell apart within a 2 weeks,0
fit great on the bottom half way to tight on top neck opening too small,0
perfect,2
i wanted to love these because i bought them as a christmas gift for my 88 year old mom she gets cold when we sit in our back yard and we dont want to leave her out of our time together but when she finally managed to shimmy into these she found that she could not bend her knees because they are so bulky warm they are but comfortable not so much sigh the search continues,1
in pictures this looks much longer its cute but too short,1
returned and got a smaller size,0
so happy with this it works so good,2
i bought these as a gift and after one day of use one of the pairs of earrings the moons broke the stars were fine but disappointed that one pair broke only after a day of use,0
adorable baby girl pajama outfit it is very soft and i love the look of the material the ruffles on the top are so cute too i ordered the 612 month size my daughter is almost 6 months old its a tad bit big on her right now so it will fit her perfectly soon i would definitely say it fits true to size,2
first time wearing the skirt which fit perfectly the rubber in the waistband detached in two places contacted seller via amazon and nothing back as of yet and its been almost 2 weeks,0
ripped beltloop within a month,0
for the most part they are good a bit thin for my taste,2
i was not pleased with length too much extra fabric,0
when i got it i felt the fabric and didnt like it it was cheap and stretch did not even unfold to try it on back it went,0
they get the job done but its very difficult to hold onto the glass and porcelain dishes while soapy,1
i love this fits perfectly i will purchase again,2
crop top shirt and super cute shorts normally am a small but ordered a medium because i like loose fitting clothes when i sleep,2
i needed a new professional looking 34teacher34 bag after looking and looking reading review after review i finally settled for this one i loved that it was simple made of real leather and adored the color as i know it will match most anything i own this bag is everything as described i like the lining with one minizippered pocket and one large zippered pocket there are also two smaller pockets that are open which is perfect for pens keys or a cell phone it helps keep me organizedbr br ive only had this bag for a couple of weeks and have used it daily and have already gotten several compliments im hoping it lasts as the leather seems a little thinner than i would have liked,2
this ring is unique and very mice with adjustable sizebr br it has a very cool look is unlike anything ive seen and made a unique high quality gift to someone the recipient is a very sophisticated high style brand person and she loved itbr br a very cool and different productbr br enjoy,2
i purchased these during a sale on amazon but if these are not on sale on amazon they could probably be found elsewhere fir less money the quality is fine but they are a bit stiff size is true so be sure and order the correct size,1
good shoe and is holding up for 270lbs human only thing was one of the hoops that you put the shoe string through was already torn off before i even tried them on rather than returning i just sowed it up and be done with it,1
just what the doctor ordered,2
the material is not strong at the first time of use you see the change on material,1
very irritating that the colored half hoops peeled their color after only a couple of uses ive gotten a few more uses out of the thinner colored hoops before their color flaked off as well the other ones are basic but cute,1
perfect for wearing around the housebr runs a little small so if you dont like fitted clothes order upbr traditional camo design various greens and blackbr short sleeved and stops midthighbr cute to wear around the housebr if you are in high school or college you might wear it as an outfit,1
purchased for my 8 year old son as he wanted some board shorts like his friends overall quality he says he likes them the main con for him with these shorts is the velcro flybr my son decided to use these shorts as an everyday pair of shorts a few weeks ago he decided to wear them to school we live in a warm climate the shorts themselves run a little large at the waist but it doesnt impact himbr he wasnt used to though with board shorts that they sit on your waist line rather then your hip so as he was walking into class wearing these he said it felt like the shorts were sliding down his waist when all of the sudden as he started walking up the stairs to his classroom the velcro fly ripped open completely exposing his cartoon silk boxers he said that fortunately he caught them before they dropped down to his anklesbr he went into say that when he went to re fasten the velcro fly less then 2 seconds later the velcro would rip back apart again simply put he was mortified as he had his cartoon silk boxers in full view to his classmates he also said every time he would go to sit down the velcro fly ended up ripping open and unfortunately when you are seated you cant re fasten the velcro fly so he had to be careful to make sure that his tshirt covered his crotch area as well as to try and not move in his seat as that could of made the shorts slide further downbr the other issue with the velcro fly is that it is one long strip of velcro and my son described it as an annoying nightmare when he went to the bathroom as the velcro material kept sticking to his underwear and that if the velcro wasnt evenly attached correctly it would lead to his underwear poking through the open spots of the velcrobr simply put he said it was an embarrassing nightmare wearing these shorts as he said that everyone at his school who he was around got a glimpse of his silk cartoon boxersbr br the bottom line is that he will keep the shorts and just knows that he has to be very cautious of the velcro fly,1
bought this for my husband as a cute gift for the holidays for him and friends to retire to the study for drinks turned out to be a very nice jacket well made good quality and fits very well and his friends loved it surprisingly for me he likes it too,2
bought these for my daughter who is obsessed with cats she was ecstatic loves them very much,2
great shirt,2
i wear chunky eye glasses and these fit over them perfectly,2
even its smallest size is large for me but with a little stitching it fits well,1
cheap,0
daughter loves it easy to read and sanitize cute too,2
i had to return them they are way bigger than i expected,1
do not order the leotard is extremely small i ordered for my 9 year old daughter who wears xs womens or 14 in girls cloths she is 5 ft tall and 80lbs i would say it fit like a 78 or smaller girls she couldnt ever pull it up to put her arms in thats the badbr the company does do returns but you have to pay shipping it was going to to cost me 7 to ship it back the cheapest way im in michigan they are in new york plus the company charges a 2 or 20 restocking fee so an item i spent 10 on i would get 1 back i will donate it before i do that at least them they cant resell it never buy from this company they were very prompt to respond to messages but all they would say was oh well that is how it goes,0
these are very blingy they do seem to retaintheir shine it is too much carat weight to look remotely real but its pretty,2
they look cheaper in reality than in the photograph a bit disappointing i will keep them to be used as a stocking stuffer probably,1
pure quality fabric beautiful to see and feel this is my nicest shirt by far,2
this umbrella works great i really like the colors and sturdiness,2
look very cheapand ive had cheap shoes before that dont look it returning,0
so so cute so white,2
literally these were the baggiest pant legs ever i sized up because im thicc and tall and nothing ever fits right in the torsothe torso fit great but everything else was so big i felt like a whole clown i couldnt wear them out because they looked so bad i did wear them once to shovel snow though and it was super durablenot really into the jnco jean look though,1
pretty disappointed with this shoe i had bought a different style by the same company and they are the best shoe ever these just arent they are stiff and rub on my foot and there is not much arch support ill wear them only if im not going to be doing much walking,1
videoid5876ccf10857216b0144d59f43b21304 hoping i can get another one expedited soon needed this for a wedding the suit was too small the material is great please remember to go up 2 sizes,1
these slippers were not as expected too padded in the foot i will keep them and wear them but the next ones i get i do not want the foot so padded,1
enjoying the earrings they have stars in additional to the amazon appearance my girlfriend likes her earrings too,2
normally i wear an 8 but in open back shoes i wear an 8 12 after reading the reviews i ordered a 9it was perfect plenty wide,2
this sunglasses looks cheap and feels cheap thats good for teenagers you wont feel heartbroken if they lose it or break it i was originally getting this sunglasses for my wife for cardriving only attracted by the fashion style my teenager daughter took it instead the large lens work well in protecting eyes from glarebr br not sure about uv protection capability i dont see any claim or statement about its uv protection capability kind of weird not seeing this information for a sunglassesbr br all in all in the price range this is an ok sunglasses not much to brag about,1
im 57 and weigh 175 lbs i purchased size m tried on and its not flattering for my body type mom pooch is exposed fits similar to a romper if you will also because of my butt the back of the dress flaps up and sits in an awkward slant see pictures,1
glasses have terrible glare i use it in fl and pretty much cannot see anything while driving i would not recommended this product for the lenses quality but if you go just for the looks it is quite nice and does not have a cheap feel,0
the material had smuges on it seems like i can wipe them off i thinkbr br the material is cheapbr br they seem to stay on when i walk around and theyre tied up so theyre securebr br v cutebr br i feel like a brat doll,2
i have this shirt in yellow black and silver the silver runs very small in the torso area it fits in the shoulders very different for t than the others colors,0
very nice shirt and fits great the problem i have is the missing snap on the left sleeve cuff poor quality control,0
im so bummed i really wanted to love this but this is not the same watch in some of the pictures false advertising the face is so tiny its heard to see i ignored some of the reviews on here because i liked the size and look of the watch in some of the pictures dont be fooled theyre reviews from a different sized watch plus the hands are not at all illuminated not worth it,0
the material of this jacket seems to be of pretty good quality and for the most part the jacket fit but something was off when it came to the fit across the shoulders im not really broad shouldered and fell within the sizing chart stats but the fit still seemed too short which made the capesleeve area look wrong im sure this jacket will work for others but it didnt for me,1
lovely design on this shirt i got this for my 8 year old nephew,2
these were too small and the material was itchy,0
awful polyester material,0
material has a nice feel but there are tabs which are pulled to give this a more fitted look which makes the fabric bulge in the back thumbs down,1
2nd one ordered 1st came without pins 2and one pins bent piece of crap amazon didnt offer replacement pins item came from china beware all products from china a total waste,0
buyers beware this is not a square 55 by 55 oversized blanket scarf like the description says the scarf is a triangle not a square that you fold into a triangle it measures approx 76 across and 34 top to bottom so technically it is 110 55 plus 55 equals 110 but this one is not 55 across and 55 top to bottom not square the scarf is also very thin when you fold a square blanket scarf into a triangle it is thick because you have 2 layers of fabric this is only 1 layer of fabric a very thin triangle and you cant wear it as a poncho either the pictures are very deceiving not gift quality i will be returning the scarf,0
i was disappointed to get these and find that only 1 side adjusts these would be perfect if both sides were adjustable its lopsided when i wear it other than that its very comfortable,1
i could fit three of me in a medium quality sucks fit is worse save your money go some other site,0
finally found bibs that fit get 6 sizes larger than regular jeans and are so comfortable i never want to take them off,2
like them there could be a lot more more padding on the bottom,1
my boy still wears the shirt ripped and all it seems good quality with a good hem lining but it got torn at the button area at the top material is top notch though,1
the hat itself was fine it was sent in an envelope and was very smashed always received hats in a box previously,1
very overpriced but i think it matches a pair of earrings so wearable,1
it is not wide enough at the toes it does not give support when walking i purchased for my 91 year old mother i was hoping this shoe had enough structural support to prevent her from tripping i ended up giving her my addias i bought at costcos and the adidas gives her support for a slip on,0
cheaply made and not what i thought it would be the sequins were only on one side,1
they are too big as they falloff,2
the skirt is nice looking i liked the color and the style however i found the material a little itchy and uncomfortable,1
i thought they were platinum plated over sterling but it just says sterling silver no platinum plated which i wanted did not return too close to christmas so i am not going to give them after all little dissapointed,2
when i read large i was like nah its fine it cant be that bad im not the biggest dude 60 ft and 140ish lbs but this hangs off me you probably want fit a xl to make this work also one thing i didnt know was the cuff area is sewn together at the bottom see last pic it was a little weird at first to put on be after putting it on once or twice to learn to raise your arm as you put it on,1
in the picture it looks like its a black hat when you receive it its navy blue quality isnt good it has terrible form looks cheap and tacky as a subaru owner i was hoping for the quality you expect with a subaru product i wanted to put it on two different times and i hated how it looked so i stil havent worn it its disappointing,0
i wanted to love this bra but the sizing is weird i ordered my normal size 38d the band was slightly too large i have a measuring tape and my actual ribcage measurement under breasts is 37 i wear a 38 band in every other bra i own i hooked it on the tightestsmallest set of hooks and wished there were another set or two of hooks to make it tighter i will say the band is nice and thick and i like the thick feel of the fabric on to the cups this 38d fit me like i was trying to stuff myself into a b cup tons of side boob spillage it is very small in the cups the cups are molded thick fabric and the shape and feel of the fabric is very nice not paper thin so there is a tiny bit of modesty but also no bulky padding i returned it but i may reorder in a smaller band size and much bigger cup size to see if a different size will work i will update when i receive the replacement,1
not as comfy as expected returned item,0
spotted zebra kids 2pack sweater cold weather hat and glove sets are not for cold northeast winters fine in weather around 3740 degrees but anything colder than your kid is going to freeze these are standard knitted gloves and hats i received a medium which is an 814 however with my sons long curly hair the hat barely fits hes 7 and doesnt have a particularly large head just a lot of hair nonetheless a hat that is supposed to fit a 14 year old doesnt fit my 7 year so the gloves are the only useful thing about them and then they wont be useful after christmas or the new year because anything at or below freezing will render them useless so if you live an area where the temperature doesnt go below 37 in the winter your child should be fine if you are used to 30 degree days most of winter then forget it it goes without saying that when the polar vortex comes nothing can save you especially not thesebr br overall the quality is decent the knit is nice and so are the colors,1
i got this for carrying to classes where i might need to haul some supplies that wouldnt fit in my tool box as well as for things like the farmers market and traveling it is not as good quality overall as the last one i purchased the cameron crossbody the material is thinner and the leather straps are not fabric backed and feel brittle and like they wont hold up long the cross on the front is the same color as the straps not reddish like i thought which is no big deal but ads to a cheaper look there are little pickets inside but they are too narrow and deep to be much use for holding say a smartphone or a pack of cigarettes or a lip balmtoo annoying to fish small things out too skinny to fit larger things theyd probably hold your sunglasses and maybe headphones there is also a zipper pocket and the top zips which is useful its a cute bag definitely unique looking and i will keep it and use it for what i bought it for as long as it lasts but for over fifty dollars if id seen it in person in a store and felt the material no way would i have spent that for it,1
cute looks just like the pic seems good quality,2
very comfy but lasted about 4 months before falling apart,0
didnt fit as expected,1
decent coffee,1
nice jacket was too small for me in the chest area im a 40ddd extra xl large was too small im about to get a refund and ill try a larger sizei hope a xxl wont be too big,1
i loved this shirt when i got it i ordered in both black and maroon the fit is perfect whether the back is buttoned or not very flattering the reason for the one star is that the material is very cheap both tops i only wore once with the back buttoned and the buttons came off of them the shirt fits perfect so it wasnt a matter of the shirt bit fitting correctly i believe theyre just poorlycheaply made very disappointing,0
i like the material it was made of,1
after three different kid watches this timex was the winner sturdy easy to set my son loves it,2
these are cute but they faded after about 4 wears,0
is comfortable but gives you uniboob,0
cute but green was the ugliest green,2
loved the watch but it stopped working after 3 months and now im going through it with seiko,0
the accuracy of the from glass was not aligned with the date on the face as a detailed eye as mine it bothered me as i saw it right away crooked as i looked at the date also i though i would try my luck to get a watch with the mother of pearl shimmer like ive seen in youtube reviews i got just a flat black with no color shimmer i could tell it was mother of pearl at a side angle but even then it was so black even in various lighting conditions outside and shining a light i ended up returning the item as i think it was previously returned,1
its cute and comfy,1
top is to tight she is not comfortable in it the pants fit fine she like them and wishes the top had been a little larger,1
this is my favorite tshirt now i absolutely love it i love the softness and the texture of the ribbing and i love the way it fits its so comfortable i wish it came in more colors,2
it was a no for me dress didnt really look like the pictures i wouldnt order this dress,0
wood is splintering and whatever stain they used has left an orange funk on my ears you can see where the stain is no longer on the plug this is with daily wear after only 10 days junk,0
comfortable nongaudy hawaiian shirt i hope the fabric softens with washings,2
homemade watch band,2
la calidad de la confección no es buena,1
fit is just fine some purchasers commented on an odor yes thats for sure its taken airing them out quite a long time for me not to notice it but it seems greatly diminished now they are comfortable for in and out of the house i use them as my back door shoes and like them for that they were inexpensive on a lightning deal so im pleased i have sensitive skin and so far they have not bothered me though i dont wear them for long periods of time,1
these tops are comfortable but after one day of wearing them they fall apart the trim came unsewn around the arm in less then 24 hours,0
the material was nice and style was what i wanted but when i tried it on the dress was way past my knee more like mid shin and just didnt look good on me im 52,0
the fit and color looks very nice on better than would have guessed,2
love the pamphlet to give to the explanation about it,2
gave a 2 star because the size i got did not fit i had ordered a size 34x28 and it was small it seem that is was a 3233 waist size the material would give it a 5 star what i liked about it was stain resistant and wrinkle resistant and feels good to wear i did return the product and reorder a bigger size im hoping its going to fit this time note ill give a new review as soon i receive my next pair of work pants,0
its okie dokie,1
they are cotton sox might be better if had a little lycra stretchy material in them,1
i loved this little wallet until it ripped on the first week of use during vacation,1
this dress is incredibly soft and comfortable to wear the fabric has some bounce and stretch to it i love the ruched sleeves and the key hole back adding some feminine details the dress fell a few inches above my knee so i added a slip extender for my personal preference of dress length the dress washed well in a garment bag on delicate cycle and then let it hang dry happy to add this to my closet with the classic colors and floral pattern,2
the fabric is so thin and noticed a hole in the crotch area after a few hours of wearing them i wouldnt waste your money get somthing else thus is terrible quality,1
i liked this ring and the matching bracelet until last night the center stone fell outdont asked me how i like it now,0
i love these boots i usually wear them with the cuff in the lowest spot but they have a zipper in the back that allows you to wear them all the way up or halfway in between the laces are long enough to wrap them around the boot or lace all the way up to the top i needed a pair of black combat boots that didnt have a print on the inside and had such a hard time finding a flattering pair until i saw these,2
these are way too big,1
i bought this to go with my 6 year olds darth vader costume for halloween this year it was ok for the price but frankly i was a bit disappointed as it doesnt shine very bright and seems a bit too cheaply made for the price i expected better quality,1
i love the material but sadly it must be cheaply made the stitching is coming out already and they are not right on me at all,0
one wordawefulbr dont buy,0
the quality is great i like the looks of it but its really deep its a lit of work to get to the bottom of this bag even with the rear access zipper i wear this bag crossbody and want it below my hip line so i have to either lift the bag to get to things or really twist and dig to get in there,2
i ordered yellow and got blue i could not figure out how to order the 40 liter size given the confusing single option of 20l 30l and 40l size you were only given one choice only the multiple size option although i love the bag it may go back,2
very cute dress and its also comfortable,2
lasted less than a year before stitching started falling apart fits smaller than expected and my little one is lean i would size up for a better fit vibrant colorful designs have held up pretty well wash after wash,2
very cute swimsuit i am 51 36c 29 37 i ordered a medium and it fits perfectly great quality,2
queda muy bien,2
if you like wacht dont buy this one first the picuture is much more nice than the wacht and the real one looks like a fake isnot have and too brighti cant use this i lost my money and time with this purchase,0
bought this watch just as a backup work watch for whenever my fossil explorist gen 4 smartwatch is on the charger works perfectly especially for a budget watch,2
i ordered this because its was a blush pink what showed up was coffee candy crème very unflattering i am 58 the dress was hardly half way down my thing not like what is pictured at all i give up on amazon dresses last three dresses were a bait and switch,0
they were gorgeous so i ordered three none of the clasps worked they are junk i was very disappointed not worth the haarlem,0
i had read the bad reviews and picked them up anyway they were the exact measurements i was looking for the lenses frames the whole works so i went into it with some optimism maybe the other reviewers were just total sourpussesbr br they arrived damaged and are the most cheaply made glasses ive ever seen they wouldnt be a bargain at 1 let alone 9,0
not an american xxl,1
i bought according to the recommended sizes and it was way too small it also is a cringy fabric i diddnt bother to return it because i paid so little it wasnt worth the hassle,0
im a big fan of asics gels anyway so love this color combo for summer the price was right too,2
holes in the sole are blocked on one shoes doesnt allow for easy drainage of water or sand,1
cheap had an 34allergic34 reaction within minutes even though im not usually sensitive to metals,0
my wife loves these,2
the hat looks good but the 34snakeskin34 part that buckles the hat in the back is just two pieces of snakeskinprinted cloth glued together and they came unglued within the first few days so now when i wear it it flops around,1
very comfortable stretches nicely keeps shape,2
off for i returned,0
the breast cancer ribbon came off after just a few days of wearing it also its supposed to glow and it does not,0
very good product my son is very happy,2
definitely runs smaller than normal bought one size bigger but it was still quite tight also theres a leather diamond attached to the back which matches the ones on the front pocketsnot a big deal just not a fan of it myself ended up returning because there was a hole in the pocket,1
i installed the batteries per the indicated polarity however the lights did not function,0
great and cheaper on amazon than walmart works as described,2
fit perfectly and is very flattering going to buy more in other colors,2
these hiking boots feel bulky and the top of the tongue is rubbing pretty badly despite the socks if it rubs like this while i walk back on forth on the rug while trying these on i will not risk wearing them on a fullday hike return,1
it doesnt look as nice as it does in the picture in person it looks more cheaply made but for the price i guess i shouldnt have expected much more it did not fit my daughters ear so we had to return it she really liked it shes 10 but i expected a little more based on the picture,1
no me gusto la tela esta un poco dura y no me quedo como pense,0
not at all what i expected the arm holes are too high up at the top area making the outfit uncomfortable to wear,0
if they werent comfortable id have never heard the end of it my girlfriend hasnt complained so i estimate that these are good,2
too small i normally wear a large but ordered an xl for room returned also material seemed thin,1
eh if i wasnt lazy i would return they feel like heavy bricks with straps i feel like im big foot nope dont recommend,0
order a larger size runs small nice fabric,2
now after 5 months they are falling apart again indoor light use only okay for the price but not what i expectedthese moccasins are very good when used as slippers the outer sole has shown excessive ware as i walk to get the mail the leather lining and laces are of good quality and performing as expected,0
true to size looks good and comfortable going to buy in other color i bought the beige,2
so tightbr i couldnt wear it,0
super cute t shirt love it cant wait until my daughter grows into it lol,2
both warm and stylish,2
these boots are very comfortable and keep my feet dry i wear them anytime not just when its wet outside,2
love the shirt i read the comments before purchasing so i knew to size up i normally wear a med or large but ordered a 2xl very happy with the fit will be great for halloween and a workout shirt after,2
made from good material,2
still a bit narrow for the sizing runs small order next size up to be safe,1
they will not fit maui jim sunglasses,0
i got a 2x for a size 14 body at first i thought it was a shirt when i got mine but i pulled it down and jazzed mine up it fits very stretch but get 1 size up whatever size you are,2
these pants are okay they are a bit bigbulky for my liking i got a size medium and im 54 and 125 lbs they are a bit too big the material is not super comfortable i initially bought them to go hiking but i dont think ill be hearing them much,1
its cute definitely semi cheap material and slightly see through but nice feel to it,2
this blouse is styled too long it almost reached my knees as therefore looks very much like a lab coat,0
a little big,1
i bought two of these and both came with completely crushed unusable crowns,0
runs small very thin material cheap product i would not order again,0
broke within 2 days,0
pretty dress but it did not fit me well,1
nice quality and details,2
nice box for keeping your watches clean and safe and it is good as a gift as well,2
was difficult to wear with the strings being on the inside and the velcro being on the outside larger then expected would go down a size,1
i prefer 100 cotton but can not find it this is nice to wear for business xl would fit better but they didnt have that size,1
low quality,1
beautiful dress not too revealing with the right amount of sex appeal i received a lot of compliments,2
i received them fast they look the same as in the picture shown the material will shred your skin though trying to slide then up my legs was painful enoughbut getting them off was miserable as wel there is no inner lining so they are not comfortable to wear either they are made cheaply but if you are in a rut then these will wor i dont have much of a tooshy and im usually a size 2502 in most pants im and xs to a small in panties from vs and i ordered the mediu they look big in the package but since there is no stretch to the material they barely fit me id definitely order a size up for sure some of the sequins fell off with me trying them on i never wore them and out them back in the package and im actually pretty tough ouch,0
look like they should be fine but slip slide all over strap terrible wish i wouldnt have ordered,0
arrived as described bigger but will work great for what i want,2
the threading rubs at the top of my foot but otherwise comfortable,1
do not bother they do not stay and the wing is too big,0
this belt was great until the swivel broke making the belt unusable and unable to be fixed fell apart as my son was wearing it after only 3 months the leather held up beautifully and the belt practically looks new but the buckle popped right off the swivel was hoping this would last until he grew out of it but no such luck,0
not what i was thinking,1
the hat was a little bigger than i needed and not what i was expecting in a bowler hat will work until i find something better though,1
these weekly amazing for the 1 month they lasted they were worn here and there out but lightly great heels for a little girl but lasted 3 weeks,1
i just returned from six weeks in europe it was the only pair of shoes i wore they are very comfortable with great arch support and i never got tired wearing them plus they are a good looking well made shoe,2
this bra is of good quality has nice stitching and four sets of hooks in the back for adjustment the shoulder straps are soft and adjustable as well the cups have padding and are lined with soft material while the outside is covered with lace it pushes breasts up and keeps them in place decent bra for everyday use it fits slightly smaller than it should but just a tiny bit,2
i like the belt and the service was great would buy again,2
the crown is smaller than it looks in the photo i wish it was a little more generous so it slouches in the back like the photo,1
great quality earrings,2
looks nice feels kinda cheap but great for special occasions,1
great for party favors or props for a photo booth,2
looks and feels very cheap i returned them,0
i have bought hanes panties for years as they were good quality and price over the past several years however they have continually become more cheaply made for example there is not enough material for good seams small holes start developing after just a few times of being worn the material has progressively become thinner and the latest change i noticed with these i just purchased is that the elastic at the top is about half the width it used to be due to all these cuts in quality the panties last only about 12 the time they used to consequently they are no longer a good value this is the last package of hanes panties i will be ordering,1
awesome qualitylove it,2
this visor has a nice big brim but unfortunately it hurts my head after only wearing for a minute the 34clip on34 part extends way in the back of the headfarther around than most clipons which usually sit behind the ear and this is very painful for me perhaps it is because i have a small head not sure but i will not be wearing it very often for any length of time,0
i just got my item in yesterday order was placed in oct once i reached out to seller item was sent unfortunately it arrived after my dec vacation i ordered it for dress is lighter weight than expected a nice plus it is size i expected and looks pretty close to picture it seems a good value just wish i had gotten it sooner as for dealing with seller really easy subtracted a star for delivery issue not actual item,2
this skirt wouldnt fit my 11 year old daughter its tiny,0
im told they are very comfortable,1
i didnt like the fit for me but they were nice and made of nice material if they had fit a little smaller i would have kept them but the small fit like a large on me and so i sent them back,1
three trips to the beach so far and everything still intact,2
warm and good fit,2
if you are 5 foot five or shorter i definitely do not recommend the shorts odd length cheap material overall dissatisfied,0
i returned because they didnt fit and seem to be a lot of shoe,0
very see through and too long i ended up wearing it as a dress but a slip is definitely needed to wear under,0
love all the colors and the fit is perfect,2
i bought several of these sayings tshirts for the holidays and this was by far the best quality the material was nice and thick not thin like all the others it did look like it runs a little on the small side so i would suggest ordering at least one size larger than usual since i gave it as a gift i cannot say if shrinkage occurred when laundered,2
beautiful detail and style i received many compliments the first day i wore them,2
i will give them to my granddaughters on christmas then i will see how they fit them,2
a lil on the small side but its really cute suggestion order one size bigger,1
i ordered the item because the recipient has a springer spaniel i was sent a pillowcase with a german shepherd on it instead the pillowcase is cute but if you order it because you wanted a springer spaniel on it you may be surprised,0
the artstyle quick release leather watch band cowhide leather replacement watch strap royal blue is a very nice color and very good quality,2
weird cut on top i had boob spillage everywhere lol,1
a little small but i love them very comfy,2
the material of this shirt is so soft and i am never uncomfortable when i wear this shirt it stretches and moves with me and yet is flowy enough to not be clingy or revealing of my lumps bumps and curves its long enough to wear with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans the only down side to this shirt is that the bottom two buttons gap and i constantly have to check to make sure its not revealing my boobs also be careful if you wear a crossbody strap purse or bag as mine has pulled open the top button a couple of times generally though the buttons stay buttoned surprisingly well and i adore this shirt id buy it again for sure,2
,1
does not stay up weird material barely stretchy i returned it,0
terrible hat smashed upon arrival and doesnt fit a child,0
gave them as gifts,1
no its way to long sizing isnt right,0
very nice and will keep you warm they are well lined sweat pants material on the outside and fuzzy lining on the inside,2
love the color design on arm is a beautiful too,2
buena tela y buenas costuras,2
as advertised,1
a very basic top with a little uniqueness on the sleeve at wrist just wore it this weekend with nice casual black dress pants for a brunch or wear it with jeans very versatile,2
they are probably worth the money just not the most comfortable glasses to wear,1
tiny,0
love it for my graduation photos great quality and very pretty in person,2
first time i wore them i got a blister which is something that i have not had in a very long time,1
used for a party and loved it,2
turned my nose green,0
the wallet is slim but it is the same size as my other wallet,1
good boots very warm a bit stiff seems to run just a tiny bit large plenty of room for winter socks,2
these socks are stapled together with a tough plastic staple and attached to cardboard wrapping that isbr as tough as steel the socks are so tightly stapled together that you c getan hardly get scissors close enough to cut the staple without damaging the socks the spot where the staple was is unraveled from having a plastic staple stuck into them i cant recommend these socks because of the ridiculous wrapping and staples plus hey are way too tight to even pull on for my size 10 feet i cant wear them,1
sweatyrocks return policy is nonexist i pay 10 to return these pants directly to sweatyrocks i have received 0 in refund you better make sure you are getting an item that fits perfectly because there is no refund this was the second pair i ordered in this size the sizing is inconsistent,0
very disappointed not like the picture shows will not buy again,0
loved the flowing sleeves,2
returned them immediately earring were so small photo was completely deceiving cheap quality,0
no good for me they were loose and it was going down to my wrist and i was keeping pulling up every minute during the day,1
i realize you get what you pay for but these are so cheaply made i doubt that i will be able to wear them more than once as soon as i put them on the seams started to split,1
i normally wear a small and size 4 this dress is perfect and i have received many compliments i will be ordering it in black,2
almost immediately tarnished very disappointing,0
great quality but does run big,1
this sweatshirt was a little disappointing to mebr the color is spot on and looks greatbr the sweatshirt is not soft inside its not as cozy as i was hopingbr in addition to that the sleeves are a little shorter than i would likebr im 55 and got the medium the overall sweatshirt fit great even a little long on the waist making it great for leggings but the sleeves hit right above my wrist bone making me feel like i needed to pull them up all day which isnt how i want to wear it,1
the underwear are not the same cut or size the pile with the strips fit my almost 3yr old great and have a typical cut and fit the pile with the green dinosaur are big and do not stay up on him and are very baggy if they all were the size and fit of the strips pile i would give it 5 stars but because the other 3 dont fit i gave it 3 stars,1
outfit is cute but did not come with belt,1
not real good material the kind that will fall apart after one wash,0
i have purchased these types of hoods along with the pants fromby russel before as one other has noted the cloth is not nearly thick as the cloth used in previous issues they still are good for cold weather and not so cold weather as an additional layer i purchased 4 without the pants the sizing is ok but remember this after all a sweatshirt now being used as a regular item of clothing of course i dont know at this point how the long the things will last identical reviews have been posted for all purchases,1
just because you sew the material into the shapeappearance of a wrap dress doesnt make it a wrap dress ordered this for an event it was cute but because it wasnt really a wrap dress i couldnt adjust the fit to my body my girls up top are l big and the back is bigger lol so once i had the dress on i had to strategically maneuver throughout the night so nothing would pop out if i had saw this dress earlier i couldve gotten it altered definitely gonna make an appt for that for the future id like to wear this again,2
nice stretchy shirt but i wear a sm normally and bought the large which was a bit snug in the chest the neckline is a bit higher on me than the picture shows as well so i sent it back,0
pefect,2
gave them away to elementary school kids too small for this adult definitely not oversized,0
i like them perfect sized to wear all the time and over night just fitting around the earlobe and perfect amount of sparkle,2
really loved these shoes but broke after 2 months,2
sizing seems off super uncomfortable straps dig in and it looks really clunky under my shirts ugly and uncomfortable,0
i absolutely adored this dress and bought it for my twins baptism the first dress was perfect size and was white not knowing what size i needed for my other twin i waited to purchase the second the second one came and not only was it a little lighter material but the dress was a little longer and more off white than white had they both been exactly the same this dress would have been 5 stars hands down my suggestion is if you have to purchase more than one purchase them at the same time because you never know what youll get if you purchase them separately,1
this is an awesome necklace though i just got it in the mail and its not a choker necklace i read in the title it was a choker but it definitely wasnt still happy with the purchase though just wanted to warn others,1
they get wet way too fast and then make your feet stinky,0
wanted to love but the zipper got stuck just trying to try them on,1
poor quality,0
cheap as hell i cant believe i payed over 10 dollars for this plastic toywatch i think its meant for kids not adults what a waste of money shouldve only payed 3 dollars total rating given is negative one,0
the shoe is very comfortable it has some arch support feels like a gym shoe and looks casualbut very functional,2
the material feels very cheap but its not a purchase i regretits alright,1
the suspenders have the usual very cheap fake leather button connectors these will rip out in no time i have had new real heavy leather connectors made at a shoe repair shop now i know these will last longer then these suspenders good suspenders should have quality leather button connectors and these do not,0
my dachshund long sleeve t shirt was all that i expected,2
cheap a little too big but they hurt my pinky toes i usually dont have any problems with shoes avoid,0
i purchase this dress for a casual summer day look loved everything about it except the smell the fabric had this awful almost chemical smell i called customer service and asked them about if i wash it and the smell is gone i would be happy to keep it otherwise i would be returning it laundered as usual the smell is still there i believe it was something in the fabric being that its made overseas one can never tell love the dress i would never order from this brand though i did purchase another very similar dress absolutely love it different brand which washed well over the past several months and i plan to order more of those wish they wouldve use better fabric and this one i would have purchased several more,0
my husband loves these says they are extremely comfortable,2
very comfortable and royal,2
large,1
foam bottom felt really cheap fashion was printed on the tongue,0
these are comfortable and look cute on but the long ties dont stay tied and dont stay wrapped up on the leg like the style shows so as you walk they come unties and your shoes fall off i would return if i could,1
love these shoes so much,2
runs really small as do most chinese products just fork over the cash and get one at a store that fits,0
very cheaply made maybe for a little girl will not last,0
its a cute casual dress the material is thin and spandex i wear a size 10 and fit me pretty snug i would suggest getting a size bigger im sure once i wash it it will be too small,0
loved the print and color of this shirt just wish it was less box shaped and a little softer would be nice overall nice shirt though,1
cute ran tts just extremely noisy pants made so much noise when i walked that i felt it obvious that these were faux i wish they had this look but not the swish and crinkle sound when you walk i am 58 and 125lbs and felt they were plenty long on my legs,1
need long belt with more length of lock teeth and quality is awsome,1
smaller than it appeared,1
this satisfies my needs will plenty of storage spots left over i have 3 credit cards on one side the opposite has my license and room for other cards there is a central pocket that i keep cash in plus two sidecentral pockets i havent even found a use for yet the material is not actually leather of course but so far seems like it will be moderately durable,2
wonderful fit warm perfect for those cold days nights,2
ok bought these for my hubby looks nice but not the best quality probably wont last long but will do the trick for now,1
sent first one in because it broke the first day wearing it and so did the second one beautiful but not worth it,0
good product,2
i loved it when i initially opened the package however i wore it once to my high school reunion and by the end of the night it was tarnished and dull it was definitely a singleuse item,0
very thin material no support and quite baggy,0
runs a bit small i think lots of pockets might be a bit hot in the summer but good for fall and winter,2
despite the description the spiderman mask i got for my toddler did not come with batteries some of the answered questions said it did and it still did not,0
i love these pants ive bought three pair and they all came much quicker than expected they are soft stretchy and fit great they also wash without problems such as shrinking or fading the only reason i did not give them five stars is because the last pair came with a hole in the crotch i was told id be sent another pair but i never received it,1
fits well but a bit of a pain to iron get all of the wrinkles out,1
great guality shipped on time,2
where you put your shoelaces theres no holes in the shoe just a rubber design that looks very cheap and flimsy just dont pull too tight they will definitely rep,1
this hoodie is as thin as it could be and still be considered clothing it is very thin as a tshirt or thinner thus doesnt really rank the actual category of hoodie it wont keep you warm it wont even fend off windbr br it will however look very cute and fitted and thats whats really important right not functionality it fits snugly though not tight do size it exactly because through the shoulder and waist its fitted well the sleeves run a bit long though i can allow that to psyche myself into thinking that makes it feel warmerbr br in all this is a cute hoodie only because it happens to have a hood otherwise its a glorified zippered longsleeved tshirt i personally dont think its worth 20 maybe 10,2
its made really nice but its very tight inside n its hard to put a wallet or medium size items in it other than a very small wallet n thats about it,1
quality product will last a long time not a 1 time use costume as many are,2
did not like the blackish coloring stone looked out of place i like bright shinny silver look will be returning,0
wore this to a masquerade party got lots of compliments on this style fit as expected would purchase from this seller again,2
absolutely love these glass the shape and color is perfect for me ive gotten so many compliments too,2
i like the color of the dress i like the design of the dress the dress was too big for me and i actually got a large it wouldve been a good church dress i just didnt like how it looked on me wasnt flattering so i sent it back but maybe somebody else would look great in it but i just didnt so the dress is just ok,0
poor quality this protection broke down after first wash returned easily customer svc was good,0
shirt is not soft cotton its stiff,1
these fit everywhere but the calves i have thin calves and these are the tightest pants ive ever felt very uncomfortable i bought another pair to see if i had just gotten a fluke but the second pair was the same would have been perfect if they had been cut right disappointed,0
i got this to give to my two dads on my wedding day they were nice and served their purpose however i wish they just a little bigger,1
i purchased this watch to have an alternative to all of my classic style metal band watches the leather band feels and looks very well made the great part about the watch is that it has a metal clasp on the inside of the leather strap that helps create a better watch fit especially for people like me with little wrists this is a classy and clean watch that will match with most burgundy or brown dress belt and shoe combinations definitely worth adding to the watch collection,2
wellthe footbed is very soft and of course the knit cloth uppers arent going to rub blisters on my feet but the lack of support means my feet hurt i bought them to wear to disney but after wearing them around for a few days i questioned whether my feet just hurt in general or whether the lack of support contributed i put on my spencos and wore them around inside for a while and my feet felt better some people can walk around in these sanuks all day without issue but i guess i cant,1
bought for husband for our 62nd anniversary,2
lets just say you get what you pay for the opal is very cheap looking,1
with this belt you can have the best of both worlds a sophisticated dress look and a sleek business look all in one the classic cognac brown leather provides a sophisticated look for dressier events and the shiny black leather is perfect for more formal business events the reversible feature is a real lifesaver and the belt rotates by simply pulling up on the buckle and twisting it until it clicks into placebr the silver belt buckle is made of steel and zamak alloy providing you with a sturdy long lasting belt the width of the belt measures 13 33mm easily sliding through jeans and slacksbr the sizing is perfect as well order one size larger than your pant size eg if you wear a size 36 in pants we suggest ordering a size 38 belt if you are in between sizes we recommend sizing upbr this belt comes in a signature box making it an ideal gift for fathers day or the perfect christmas gift for your husband boyfriend dad or brotherbr at az by alexander zar they take pride in making quality mens leather belts for everyday life az belts are designed in la usa and made in mexicobr br prosbr reversible featurebr sleek and sturdy belt bucklebr proper sizingbr comes in a signature boxbr br consbr nonebr br overall i would highly recommend this belt to any man looking for a versatile and stylish belt its a two for one deal that cant be beat as the dude from the big lebowski would say im the dude so thats what you call me that or his dudeness or duder or el duderino if youre not into the whole brevity thing and lets be real who doesnt love a good brevity thing when it comes to accessorizing the az mens reversible belt classic is a musthave in any mans wardrobe,2
i chose this for my six year old partly because it made me laugh to have such a pattern on both the shirt and the pants it is a bold look however i was confident my six year old could pull it off and boy was he excited to wear this outfit to school i heard him talking to himself while he was getting ready all my friends are going to be so jealous of my outfitbr br the outfit held up well to washing and drying and through his school day also he reported three compliments were given to him at school i would say it fits true to size i got him the size 78 and he is still six and he can wear it but he definitely has room to growbr br also i am happy to see some playful options for little boy clothing,2
way too small,0
zaful needs to get with the program large is huge and the medium gas bottoms that fit but a top that is tiny you cant order separate sizing stupid sending this suit back and keeping one only for the bottoms basically throwing the top away the material seems ok for the price,0
love theses bags and the bag that comes with them to keep them all together,2
clasp on necklace broke trying to put it on when received there were charms loose in bag the bracketring thing just flopped around and then broke its cute just cheap,0
im hat size 6263 or 7 347 78 and this hat is perfect and soft it seems well made it is certainly warm,2
was a nice shirt but the time and true sherpa shirts at walmart are thicker and less expensive,2
very pretty but more childsized than adult,0
i liked the style and the material but unfortunately the size i ordered did not fit normally i wear a size 10 med but had to send these back,1
the packers emblem literally wore off in less than 10 days and although i registered for the warranty the company wanted me to jump through hoops for a replacement wont purchase again,0
these shoes look lovely and the front of it is really comfy its even the right height heel i love the tassel moving as i walk the one drawback is a major letdown which caused this shoe to lose 2 stars the back of the shoe rises so high that it rubs uncomfortably behind my ankle first time i wore it to work and the only time it cut into the area above abd blistered one side and took off the skin on the other so sad as it is a very pretty classy shoe,1
cute dress fits snug more for spring or fall season,1
,1
besides xlarge wasnt true to size too small i was disappointed that the fabric was not soft to the touch as advertised i expected a more soft plush material not worth my time nor expense in sending it back,0
the fit was way too large nothing i can wear i purchased a size medium,0
i love these boots they are very warm and comfortable but are not for everyone i sized up toa 9 and because my feet are somewhat narrow they fit me very well if you have a wider foot or calf they probably will not work for you,2
fell apart after several wearings normal careful wear cheap not reliable buckle just dropped off the plastic belts leather look are wrapped five times in different layers and thicknesses of plastic each belt is wrapped separately each belt is wrapped in plastic rolled and wrapped in more plastic sealed and the sealed plastic wrapped belt is then wrapped in another plastic sleeve which is then inserted into a nylon bag that is then sealed in another plastic bag it took several minutes to open each belt the belt quality is acceptable but only for casual wear and the durability is uncertain the black belt is passable the tanbrown belt is clearly plastic manufactured to appear leatherlike the writing on the packaging is chinese the belts are shipped in a reasonable period of time the price is low no doubt because they are chinesemade the excessive use of plastic for a plastic belt is worrisome in the current environmental crisis,0
it is not as seen on picture and doesnt even have enough around for a wreath legs hang flat dont have time to return it,0
so cute my nieces are fighting over it,2
underwear are extremely unflattering the design itself is just ugly and i would never want my husband to see me in them they also leave very visible lines and demarcations that you can see through clothes especially clothes that are thinner fabric they push your fat out in the wrong places and the control of your tummy is a little to none so i basically threw them away,0
it is a very cute and playful hat for anyone willing to wear it however i feel the 2br puffs should be attached more securely onto the hat hopefully they wont fall offbr other than that its a very nice hat,2
its super cute and definitely worth the money,2
need large chapstick like eos stick if you use regular size chapstick youll lose them all,0
this is fake dyed not ruby color is wearing off,0
personal use great choice,2
horrible quality,0
arms of the frame dont seem to be in proportion to the frame,1
these suspenders broken the second time i tried to use them,0
dress is big enough belt is way too small even though its labeled xl,1
its an okay bag but in my opinion it is not large and i would not classify it as a tote bag i can only fit about half the itemsbr from my regular purse in it it appears to be pretty well made although not genuine leather,1
fit my nose as expected nice quality,2
these are as thick as tissue paper very delicate and stiff as if they were starched worst part is that they arrived with the white ones stained the red had bled onto them turning half of each white bandanna pink no bueno,0
i paid 30 for this with sewing errors it is definitely not worth it,0
im normally a size 4 34b 135 lbs and a small fits me perfectly i bought the turquoise and the color isnt as bright as it is in the picture but its still pretty i plan on wearing flats so its a couple inches too long im 5634 but it would be perfect with heels the material is great a bit clingy but dressy enough to wear to a wedding i hope this helps someonebr br edit the material is much more revealing than i originally thought its heavy clingy and i had to layer 3 slips under the dress just to keep every line of my underwear from showing although i loved it when i first purchased it i will probably never wear it again im changing my rating from a 5 to a 3,1
mid,1
love the dressthere is a lot of glitter fall when first putting it on but still super nice,2
i absolutely love these shorts they are comfy they hang right they are a thicker material but not hot at all the construction of the shorts is very good and i know they will last a very long time they are high quality and i am going to purchase another pair so i can have another color,2
one pair washed and dried without any problem but the other pair shrunk a lot too much,1
we bought this for our halloween dummy scarecrow its very creepy the mask had a funny smell not sure id want to wear it myself for too longbut its definitely creepy we scared the delivery people with it as they thought our scarecrow was a real man,2
definitely made in china and was delivered very wrinkled and smelled terrible cant beat the price but nothing exciting,1
the body and straps are brown thought they were black in the picture the animal print looks like and is a cheap plastic material cannot use this purse,0
had two pairs both got a hole in the same place my guess cheap stitching job,0
dont love the fact that the dye rubs off on everything even after washing it a couple times,1
cute but not great for those with a long torso,1
while i love the weight and the bead colors the bands at the ends of each cord tend to stretch and release the arms of my glasses both readers and sunglasses after a short time now i use them to keep knitting needles together as a set while not being used very disappointing,1
,2
too small purchased another shoe the same size and this one didnt fit the bottom is also made of a light weak foam material,0
i understand these bracelets are meant to absorb negative energy ojo and unravel and fall off but the actual quality is poorly made and unravels fast,0
it is very soft and looks exactly like the picture it fits well but my husband noticed that the fabric dye is some places seems to not have caught as you can see in the picture it takes up my entire knee disappointing considering i hadnt even washed them and it was already faded,0
plastic on the right side ear holder broke within the first week,1
great ring,2
will be great for outdoor work that little thing on top appears more to let air in and out so that the hands dont sweat too heavily,2
the back strap going over the back heel doesnt fit properly on the upper heel,0
a really beautiful dress i find it to be very flattering and comfortable the green color i ordered isnt sheer,2
this is an ok top its thin so dont think it will keep you warm in the winter even though it comes up under sweat shirts i thought the color was grey black but its actually a purple shade not quite what i was expecting but not enough for me to send it back what ever happened to soft fluffy sweat shirts maybe i need to do more looking at other products,1
the capsules wont seat in the machine they just drop through to the waste chamber not eligible for return so we wasted 45 dont buy from amazon get these traditional style pods from nespresso directly,0
fits fine material could be a bit litter feels stuffy after a while,1
this is perfect to organize the watches great quality,2
bought these for dog walking on many types of terrain and they are quite up to mountain trails pavement and rocky slopes i think they are stylish enough for casual dress as they have a leather look and the merrell brand i have had other shoes from merrill and was confident of a good fit,2
i wear a misses size 10 i ordered xxx it was still to small i gave it to my niece misses size 6 the waist band on the pajama pants is really small beautiful fabric well made just not for the average american figure,1
these run too small maybe a full size too smallbr br she put these on and loved the weight and feel everything except the size it was too small probably a full size too smallbr br they look great feel very light seem well made just too smallbr br she will donate these to a friend and may order more in a bigger size,1
the item itself was nice i ordered 2 1 for me and 1 for my friend to be worn as toe rings when they came in i noticed that 1 was considerably smaller than the other 1 package said it was a toe ring the smaller of the 2 and the other package said it was a midi ring there is no way the 34toe ring34 would fit an adult toe i ended up keeping the midi ring for me and gave the 34toe ring34 to my teenage daughter who has tiny toes,1
i dont like the fact that they dont stay up,1
nice shirt ti style with vest and jeans,2
great collection just dont like that it was shipped 2 days later than i was told,1
have only worn these for one week but so far so good i need wraparound shades because of some eye problems and many are shaped in such a way that they either rest upon you cheeks not your nose or are such a tight surroundfit that they stop the natural cooling air flow these dudumas fit well and there is plenty of vent room all around while still shielding your eyes from side glare i do wish that there was not quite so much bend built into the temple pieces but it seems that its the nature of the beast i expect that these will continue to satisfy me and to be honest at the price i wouldnt expect them to last foreverbr br update i continue to be really impressed with these shades especially at this price point and am going to elevate my review to 5 stars for 34i love it34 one thing that i should point out is the the top rim of the glasses does stand out from your brow just enough to allow a little glare in and make a hat of some sort beneficial of course they are 34baseball cycling fishing golf34 sunglasses so i should expect that these are polarized because you can see below the surface of standing water fishing rather than your view being obsured by glarebr br i gotta say though that i owned one pair of the oakleys and while they are a good product i guarantee that they arent 13500 better than the dudumas,2
very low quality wanted to use as a gift but chose not to due to it being so cheap looking,0
super cheep material that stretched out during first wear i donated it to goodwill substandard,0
no problem,2
i would have given 0 stars but cant extremely disappointedbr definitely not what you think youre getting the v neck is off center the sleeves were 34 not long and seemed to be like a belly shirt material is not like a hoodie sweatshirt its a cheap materialbr dont waste your money,0
noisy winder consider putting in another room it makes noise,1
holy tiny these are terrible literally microundies returning immediately in no universe are these for adults size medium fits like a very tight size small,0
nope,0
i returned these as they were not comfortable for my feet,1
its so cute but i know i cant clean or sleep in it depends on what you are looking for not what i was expecting but for,0
honestly theyre not terrible shirts for the money my biggest issue was they dont really compress that much which is the point of the shirt 255,1
i wear a regular size 9 and this gold thong sandal fit in length but the gold straps are loose as though made for a very thick or fat foot so i cant walk in them the straps hover 12 from the top of my foot no support might as well be no straps just not possible to walk in them,1
thought these were great until i went to the local nike store and paid 199 per pair complete price scam,0
it works ok but is just huge it takes up have my purse i do like that i can use it as a clutch too functional so im using it but if id seen it in the store i never would have bought it,1
this item is very cheap looking in person took atleast 6 weeks to arrive,0
super cute,2
ive never had my feet stink until i started wearing these slippers theyre comfortable and fit well but the inner insulation started coming out immediately and after a week of normal use my feet stank,1
i bought these in february for my boyfriend and he really loved them but here we are not even a year later and the darn things broke the rubber end that connects to the wire wore out despite him trying to be careful with them once he saw it starting to crack you get what you pay for i suppose will be buying a replacement pair,1
the best brand of bra so gentle and comfortable to the skin,2
nice beltmade nicebelt buckle is strong and well madei like this belt keep up the great work,2
i ordered burgundy and received a wine red am very disappointed,0
muy buena calidad está hermoso mi hija le encanto,2
very light to wear in the summer,2
awesome very useful and helpful im relatively tall and often times i find my shirt comes untucked in the back after long periods of sittings or for that matter moving these are very comfortable and do a beautiful job of keeping my shirt tail where it belongs and my buttcrack out of the public view youre welcome im 634234 and i wear them extended to the maximum length however these would still work if i were several inches taller as the tension is not problematic at all these have been fantastic every day while sitting standing driving walking running etc in short they never get in the way of anything you would reasonably do in dress clothes they simply make you look better while doing it,2
socks are great but need 2 more inches on the calf,2
style was as expected,2
this sweat shirt is super soft on the outside but scratchy on the inside i have decided to return it,1
its a cute ring but i really would have liked the black part to not be so thick the thickness makes it look more like a mens ring,1
just what i had hoped for in styling function and value for the price keeps perfect time and looks great doing it i really like the batteryless quartz idea,2
would be better without under slip more fitting then dress and less giving,1
cute shirt for the money but two sizes too small,1
this is a beautiful top and very well made however it runs so small i normally wear a medium but i followed the size chart and ordered a large the large is tight,1
couldnt find one locally in any store glad to have found this on amazon fit perfectly good quality,2
elastic broke as i was wearing it lost almost all beads,1
horrible ironed my suits before packing and they looked like they came from a dumpster terrible zippers that dont close and worstwith minimal packing doesnt fit in overhead and had to be checkedwhich was the whole pointbr br avoid this product im sending it back garbage,0
perfect it was easy to replace i am very happy with this purchase,2
its ok would not brag on it though,1
bought for my husband fits well,2
great fit,2
very pretty little crossbody bag holds just enough my phone small wallet checkbookplanner lipstick ear buds pen comb im a bigger gal and its still comfortable on me looks very stylish too,2
my wife loved the color and design of the coat but it was almost impossible to zip up unfortunately we returned the coat,1
it is absolutely ridiculous to say these are an 11 and on top of it i ordered the brown and got leopard so disappointing and misleading,0
didnt fit at all fit my boobs weird and i couldnt button it up if you want to feel like a whale buy this,0
love love love it,2
this dress looks nothing like what is pictured the colors are very different and the style fits weird i would not recommend this dress,0
this bag stinks literally it smells like an outhouse not exaggerating i noticed it as soon as i opened the packaging there is a card included that tells you the smell is 34normal34 and to 34air it out or put tea bags inside the bag fora few days to get rid of the smell34 nope several days later airing it outside in the garage putting tea bags inside it spraying febreeze inside it i brought it in the house hung it on my hook in the mudroom closed the door and within an hour it made the whole room smell like an outhouse packaged it up and its getting returned asap cant imagine trying to use this bag anywhere it smells like a dirty diaper,0
have owned many pairs of keens this model was not up to par for me lack of padding and rough edge on back of heel caused blisters with each wear not due to lack of room sizing was correct large enourgh to accommodate orthotics sole was stiffer than other keens so did not conform to foot as expected also the squeaking noise still a keen fan but will stick to the classic models,0
this is a nice piece for a misses as womens wear it does not add to the mature figure and is not in any way modest it fits like a workout suit this should not be called womens wear took me forever to get out of it,0
loved item perfect gift,2
lenses were scratched day they arrived fit ok,1
crazy about these earrings so cute,2
beautiful but they broke the second time i wore them,1
i want to love this belt i really do but they dont make it easybr br this is a great belt for those that dont need one if all you need out of a belt is something to hold your leatherman holster youll be happy if you actually expect it to hold your pants up prepare to be disappointed i have to tighten up the belt several times a day and have lost count of the number of times my pants have dropped to my ankles wearing this belt with my hands fullbr br this belt is completely unusable for anyone who actually needs it i still wear it but only as a fashion accessory unless you pair this belt with a set of suspenders to actually hold your pants up prepare to show the world your backside when you least expect it,0
shoe didnt last very long i got another brand that is more suitable for my work environment,0
perfect,2
not high quality leather you get what you paid for,0
no photo,0
but its not soo warm i can feel the cold weather in my back not good,1
the earrings are beautiful but the plastic stick they gave to put in your ear broke immediately as i tried to put it through my and the earring now its actually stuck in my ear because the plastic stick broke i need some to use tools to get it out then maybe whittle some wood without splinters to actually be able to wear these gorgeous earrings,1
i was hoping these shoes were the answer to my quest for a minimalist shoe with just enough padding to soothe aching balls of feet during longer runs dont listen to the reviews that tell you to buy big i did and my shoes are a solid half size too large this company needs to make half sizes becuase the 37s would have been too small but the 38s were too big the padding is almost exactly like the new balance minimus or merrel glove i would have preferred more the soles are pretty flimsy i tried trail running with them but felt every rock on the bottoms of my feet and it hurt i use them to lift weights in but cant run in them bc they are too big and too flimsy for trails or rocky surfaces,1
wife loves these,2
suspicious its a knock off side pocket zipper is sticky hardware flimsy use everyday so well see how long it lastsbr update returned,1
out of the 4 one of them broke the 2nd day i wore it magnets are kind of weak,1
i ordered a black purple and gold one but received a bright turquoise and pink one,0
constructed will but should have been larger 834,1
didnt fit well and no support,0
its literally fabric glued to those cheap adjustable rings from gumball machines the bracelet chain is too small so you see the clasp on the side of your wrist but i paid only a couple dollars so ill situate it in better jewelry since its a very pretty,0
at one point you could buy all 5 of these unique nose rings for 1499 all 5 each one differently compared to the next i purchased at least 34 times now you can only purchase them individually at 1799 now wow 1499 for all 5 to 1799 for just one let that sink in,0
the largest size is too small for 11w feet or larger,1
cute and lightweight i got the grey and it is slightly sheer but an easy pj set,2
i wanted a small thin wallet this is ok the slots are very tight its difficult to pull credit cards out the leather is nice the price was reasonable,1
worked pretty good for me will keep them for next season,2
certainly great shoes just meant for really narrow feet,1
these are good but pricy ive bought other brands that were cheaper and warmer,1
the nose would not stay on it was also too hard,0
broken within minutes of me putting them onbr awful quality,0
cute suit but probably because of the amount of polyester it doesnt fit tight to the skin at under arms or legs,0
no es lo que se menciona el producto,1
these are not what i ordered but that work as i ordered the all clear pair they are nice sunglasses and well made they come with a cleaning cloth and that is it which isnt typical for sunglasses since you usually get a cleaning cloth mini screwdriver plus case but dont we all have a dozen of those lying around i know i do i have an average female head and these fit great,2
this suit is amazing i didnt think i could get something so cute with quality at such a low price better than some expensive victoria secret bathing suit that has lower quality in fabric i got compliments at a pool party i hosted i never like wearing a bathing suit in public lol and this outfit made me feel pretty amazing the cut flatters my wide hips i could go on only so so part was that i had to order a small and a bottom to match my bottom and top size but its so cheap i didnt really care much about that bravo,2
purse started to come apart around the edges which look like wax,0
i wanted a big chunky necklace to wear for my wedding and i ended up finding this i dont typically purchase items without a lot of reviews but the companies other products seemed solid so i decided to cross my fingers and buy it im really really glad i did the necklace was absolutely perfect for my big day it is made out of a plastic resin type material but it feels like good quality and the chain is really nice everyone thought it was an expensive jade necklace i ended up buying another one in the jade color to make brooches for my mom and my mother in law and i bought one in red as well since its so pretty im really glad i took the chance and purchased this,2
i got a big dome but kinda small,1
this product is only good if you want cosmetic glasses for giving a look did not protect my eyes from glare or blue light my eyes still hurt after late might gaming and it provides no tinting of any kind,0
love it just a little to long,2
colorful and soft fairly lightweight i prefer these to masks which seem to restrict airflow,2
will use as nightgown very sheer,1
beautiful fit if it werent for the v part in the front coming down too far it overwhelmed and my husband agreed it wasnt for me otherwise it fit everywhere else good,1
was looking forward to wearing this on my trip to jamaica unfortunately it was too small and i had to return,1
good,1
a normal large was too tight across the chest i liked the quality of the material and the workmanship was good i suggest ordering one size larger than you normally wear,0
look greats but cheaper on ebay,1
too small to fit my ankle but used as a bracelet,1
i had previously ordered 2 of these winter kids ski masks and was happy with the quality so i ordered a third for my youngest at a later time unfortunately the third mask came with both sides of the adjustable strings with broken plastic and not fed through correctly disappointed the third mask did not come made as well as the first two,0
perfect as usual,2
at first i was extremely pleased with both the service and quality of this bracelet after two months i am extremely disappointed in the durability of the bracelet several of the links have already loosened and one has come out completely the bracelet looks great when you first get it but the durability is quite poor a quality item should not have this happen in just two months,0
got for work looks great but it doesnt stop the sweat from getting in my eyes after a long procedure,1
maybe my head is just big,1
the were a bit small,0
these are great shoes that are very comfortable and affordable,2
nothing brought for grandkids,2
perfect gift for first time mother,2
i only received one pair of jeans for my autistic daughter and the photo shows 2 pair im a single mom on a budget and thought i was getting 2 pair very disappointing i really needed the two pair as shown for the price,0
was to small,0
runs a size smaller than expected its lighter weight than it looked i ordered the black and expected a speckled look but was pleased it was darker than the pictures,1
it looks nice but the chain isnt as smooth as i expected and looks cheap i am a grown woman with skinny wrists and it fits but seems more fitting to a young woman or teen also hard to secure the clasp therefore hard to put on not a piece i want to wear every day so since its so difficult to secure i have given it away,1
was not satisfied with this item too largebr ordered according to chart,0
wasnt the ring pictured,0
i will never buy these again it was like wearing heels my foot kept sliding forward and they actually hurt after wearing thembr br these shoes were not made for walking,0
these are accurate to the picture but the space that allows the hook to go through your ear is very narrow so its kind of hard to actually put them in,1
i saw it on some reviews but i think it really depends on the size i had size 6 regular inseam and pants looked super wide at the bottom also i think they could be nice everyday pants but not too comfortable for hiking i will be returning them,1
i ordered both the 13 and 14 diamond earrings they arrived today and i opened them immediately to wear them the 14 carat posts are so bent they are really a squiggle the 13 have a bit of a curve in each post i am going to try to straighten them myself but fear i may have to take them to a jeweler and have them reset these are not expensive diamonds by any means but i think they should come with straight posts regardless lets face it if i could afford nice diamonds i wouldnt buy them on amazon but i shouldnt have to take them elsewhere for more money to make them wearable the diamonds themselves have a nice sparkle which is what i wanted so they are worth the one star but its so hard to get the backs on the squiggle posts that my ears are red i was going to order the 15 size next month but am thinking better of it now,0
quote small and very thin good hoodie for 6068 degree days id say but mine ride up above my hips which is a big im a skinny 511 guy broad shoulders fits the shoulders but i cant answer the phone without flashing some not so happy trail,0
nice design but the metal give me a rash and compass is just a stickernot real,1
look pretty on but i cant get one of them off i think im going to have to resort to wire cuttersnot happy about that,0
these are pretty cute socks they definitely compressed my legs i have large calves so maybe that is why they felt tight enough on my legs but were pretty loosewide on my feet they worked and maybe my feet were more comfortable with them being a bit looser my swelling is on my ankles when ive been standing a long time and these socks fixed that issue i liked them a lot except for the sweaty feet which is my problem always just a tmi tip if anyone is like me when i dont wear antiperspirant under my arms my feet dont get so sweaty lately i have been wearing antiperspirant instead of just deodorant and my poor feet know it i guess the sweat needs to come out somewhere,2
the ring was smaller than expected and cut my nose,0
i like it price is too high by at least 500 imo be prepared to assemble and tinker for at least an hour until its the way you like it nice itembr br now that i have had it a while im not all too impressed skip it try another brand,1
received them in great condition and fit as advertised these boots are good high quality shoes definitely recommend to all,2
bright color but size are not right it seems the size are from different country,1
had dent in it only thing that was bad,1
ended up returning way too small of a fit had a tear in the material on the side not as expected,1
these gloves look fit and feel like cheap gloves but the stitching is better and these actually arent falling apart right away i bought these as an addon item on amazon for under 5 and that was a good deal,1
way too big an inch longer than other brands in the same size,1
i have thick legs and im very picky about my athletic shorts these are breezy but still curve my waist in i love high waisted everything and these are super comfortable,2
i wear a fair number of size 32 waist jeans and trousers but these wouldnt do not only was the waist snug but the thighs were super tight while i do a fair amount of cycling resulting in thigher quads than most these were simply too tight to be wearable,1
bought these for work,2
i have worn out several pairs of muck boots but these were a huge disappointment the heel came loose and the entire sole was going to come off amazon graciously refunded my money they didnt last two months so disappointing,0
very thin silky material pretty pattern but probably not worth the money id pay 20 for this but not 40,1
horrible,0
nice dress material not scratchy has nice texture to it did arrive with bow coming loose but was quick fix does rum a little tight in the chest though,2
so far so good durable and easy slip on now,2
fits perfect and absolutely adorable im 511 and about 31 inches around up top a small fits well and hits exactly where it should,2
value for money is great but the band has wear that makes it look cheap,2
if you plan to buy this product make sure you get to size larger if its very very small and it is uncomfortable to wear,1
i was a bit surprised to see how small the earrings were i thought they would be bigger but that couldve been my fault the material is a bit cheap but they are very cute,1
im not pleased with this purchase the band itself looks as advertised and seems well made however the tool shown to easily remove links from it was not included im livid ive been trying everything i can to remove the extra pins but nothing is working this has been a total headache save yourself the trouble and order something else,0
these fit great bought them for my 12 year old daughter and she loves them,2
thank you these are exactly as described and perfectly matched your packaging is beautiful it was the perfect gift to myself wish you had a coppery brown like these,2
looks nice but was uncomfortable and scratchy,0
its a cute pattern but the material is itchy and the fit is actually quite boxy and unflattering,1
bought it in may and by the end of summer september it was all faded,0
these were very nice shorts except that they do make a swoosh sound when you walk maybe if you have stove pipe legs they would be perfect but i dont i have some senior meat on my bones and i didnt like they way the fit me,1
fantastic,0
really just not a comfortable or helpful bra for larger breasttorib ratio buy the coobie bra instead,0
buyer be aware you cannot return this item without major headaches the dress fits odd around the bust and it has a corset in the back that makes it look cheap,0
i bought a small tooks like a large,0
the fasteners are so poorly made and will slide out with the smallest amount of pressure no matter how you fasten them do not buy these spend the money for something better,0
unfortunately these are child size the picture shows them compared to adult size i have the adult size and wanted a replacement but this is too small retuned,0
this little top is so comfortable and cool its great for summer,2
i had trouble adjusting it to fit me,1
fabric ok and washes well good for around the house wearbr very large though like wearing a sack,0
one is perfect one the clasp is broken bent,0
cheap letters,0
size said 34 to 38 inch waste they have to be smaller than 34 label says large but they are not love the colors and the fabric shame as they are exactly what i was wanting slightly disappointed but i will survive will probably not order clothes thru amazon due to size confusion thanks for your concern,0
it is a cute cardigan made well but the arms are tight at the top i ordered a size bigger for the flowy kind of look for the fall and it is more like my normal size rather than oversized i have chunky arms and it is tight at the top of that arms and there isnt really a lot of stretch in it over all it is cute though i would say 610 would recommend,1
i weigh 149 and small is too big for me i look like preggy not flattering,1
im a true size 9 with no special shoe needs these did not fit well the foor bed was ok but the back strap was too big there was a significant gap between my heel and the strap beyond that issue the footbed felt comfortablebr br if you cant tell in the pictures the colored part is kind of a flat semishiney suede material nothing id wear during summer months seems more like a winter material to me,0
i loved my first order so much that i placed a second order in another assortment of colors these are so soft and the fit is perfect highly recommend them,2
turned color very quickly,0
my husband loves his new flannel such a nice look and very nice material great quality for the price true to size,2
watch is as expected took 2 months to arrive,1
this is definitely a get what you pay for kind of product it may be just bad luck on my part but the stitching on these shorts is garbage several of the pockets have holes in them from the stitching breaking or being loose and two of the outer pockets are coming off my advice would be to avoid this brand,0
the ruffle at the bottom didnt lay right and the color was too bold the color reminded me of a neon swimsuit i had as a kid the fit was slightly bigger but as a size 6 the medium was still fine i figured the cotton would shrink and i didnt want the dress to be too short the size wasnt why i returned the dress it was the neon colors which limited where i could wear the dress,0
not only was it dead on arrival it is not waterproof they state on the product page waterproof3atm98ft then right under it say that it is not suitable for swimmingbr i returned it for a refund this watch is a cheap one not worth the amount they are selling it for,0
cheap but good for work socks,1
i weigh 133 small boned 34b i couldnt get a size 12 over my arms i dont know what set theyre shooting for here but it definitely isnt american women,0
i bought these in november and really liked them they were quite expensive so i thought the quality would be goodbr they lasted four months before they snapped beside the hingebr of course the return window is 3 monthsbr very disappointing,0
it came in and the watch band is rusted i have not tried to return it yet,0
this is a cute plot twist onesie it is a little thin and made in overseas but none the less still cute i dont see this lasting long,1
i had to cut the sleeves because they were too tight runs very small like junior size,1
i normally where a xxl so i bought it in that size i now where to lounge around the house or sleep almost big enough to where as a dress,1
good band and durable have worn for a couple months and no scratches and fits well,2
these shorts are good not great theyre true to size but a little thin not excellent swim material the hem on the legs feels a little constricting on the thighs if youre a thick pear girl,1
my jewelry was scattered all over the placebr im still working on organizing i was pleasantly surprised at how many features there were especially the plush ring holderbr i am a dropper where it falls glad those days are mostly over,2
,0
nothing like the photo poorly seen very cheap fabric disappointed,0
what arrived was 34super stretch 34 the search for jeans without any spandex continues returning,0
meh,0
description said size is xl its not thanks for wasting my time returning,0
excellent,2
regular quality frames are uncomfortable and some have smudges that dont let you see clearly however the colors are awesome just keeping two pairs the rest are gone you get what you paid for cheap glasses in the low quality end,0
socks fit great and i love the design of these they are soft and stretchy with a perfect fit,2
really like the weight and length of this night shirt the bamboo makes for a lighter material nice length,2
really wanted the solid top with more arch support but it was so wide and i followed the directions and ordered a size smaller since i was a half size but it was still too long too that i could not tell anything about the arch this shoe would be perfect for a diabetic to not crowd their toes or someone with really wide feet but it was way too widelong for me had to send it back,1
very cute,2
these shoes are super cutehowever they are sadly much smaller than advertised and are made of firm unstretchable material our 2 year old is a size 7 and these are probably a whole size smaller and not wide at all,1
the fit for this bathing suit is so perfect it hides what i want it to but flatters your body so much,2
i have bought no brand of handbag other than coach for the past 38 years i am a devoted and diehard fan i love the look of this bag but i cannot understand why they didnt make it just a tiny bit bigger so i dont have to fight with it every time i pull out my wallet and have to fit it back in there the interior design of this thing is maddening i wont even complain that the fabric is wearing away after only a year i would still love it if my coach wallet would fit comfortably inside first time i have ever given anything but a rave review for a coach product,0
looks a little different than photo but price is good buy a little bigger,1
too small for my sons 105 foot they were returned with no problems,1
i bought an xl thinking it would fit nope but my 14 yr old niece loves it because she is the only one that could fit it ps my niece wears a size 4,0
right sizes,2
theyre wonderful after i learned how to use them i split a few until i realized that if you heat it just a bit so the plastic is more pliable it wont split but it does make the post thicker so if your piercing is tiny itll hurt another thing i found is the backings they sent and the regular backing both will not fit on top of that big of a gauge so i used the soft gummy type backings and they worked perfectly hope that helps anyone thats on the fence about these,2
she loved it fit fine,1
these are great,2
natural ruby reacts to uv light the necklace is advertised as natural ruby from brasil but it doesnt react to uv light i even put a string of natural ruby beads next to the necklace to show how ruby shows its floracent propertiesbr br if you want natural ruby dont buy i did find natural ruby beads about the same size for about the same price thoughbr br i did receive a refund from the seller they replied quickly and didnt make the transaction a pain so i changed my rating to 3 stars,1
the belt was delivered quickly it fit correctly using their guidelines and was just as advertised a quality good looking heavy leather belt further a followup email said if the fit was not correct to simply respond to that email and they would send me a new size with a postage paid return label that said into my 70s i dont think i will have to avail myself of the 100 year warranty,2
front snap was not as expected and did not like the back,0
i wanted these to work they are so cute but the first time trying to put them on the bar snapped and i cant fix it so ibr guess i have one earring now and not two,0
this dress was exactly what i was looking for to wear to an outdoor wedding light enough to keep you cool but dressy at the same time,2
aceptable,1
it was way shorter than a similar brand dress that i ordered i gave it away to someone who was shorter than me i am 57,1
videoid7bba79fee052133feee0f49275d8e580 it was a great value for the money nice quality soft,2
very nice dress shirt i purchased for my husband he wears a dress shirt every sunday the ties stitching is good looks great,2
,2
do not order this set i bought it for a trip and just landed and the wheel broke off the large bag so disappointed i would give zero stars but apparently you have to give at least one,0
these are cute but not what i ordered these are way too short,0
for a long tme i had considered how i would make the ideal carryon suitcase one that could hold a suit or two and all of the sundries and that could withstand the beating it would take in those cases when no overhead space is available and a gate check is required this case appeared to have all of this ideas in mind construction seems to be very goog and well beyond that of any other bag i have found for under 150 on the downside it appears to be on the very high end of what could be considered a carry on bag and fully expanded it might not fit in the overhead compartment on the smaller jets packing it is a pleasure as it allows a suit to be draped fulllength and then folded neatly into the bag if one had the patience to use tissue paper when packing i am certain that the garments would unpack without a wrinkle ill find out this weekend as i am flying international and it will contain one suit two slacks and a sportcoat most hanging garment bags do not have that capability,2
this bag has a lot of different zippered compartments it looks great and is very well made it can be worn as a sling or as a backpack and is a very nice size,2
i have wide feet so expected them to be snug i had to remove the insole to get my feet in the shoes can only wear with thin socks or no socks on the ankle area is really tight they work well around the house in the morning before the heat kicks in,1
product didnt fit my husband,1
this watch is not strong or durable the second hand broke in the first week,0
love them i was able to up 20lbs on the weights with no problem,2
ordered this top in several colors washed them together before wearing and dark blue color faded onto lighter tops so all were ruined before wearing them,1
not worth it just spend a few extra dollars and purchase a nice quality wallet,0
i was really disappointed the sizing is not accurate i wanted to love this shirt so sad,0
im guessing with mark all over the purse thats why its marked down so much i got a really good deal on it and was so excited to get it in today to find out theres marks all over the purse i was able to get some of them out but not all,1
fits way smaller than said size go up a size if you purchase this shirt,1
my favorite put on and go slides theyre so comfy and lightweight if ive got to run out i put these bad boys on and gooooo,2
loved the hat should get 5 stars on cuteness but way too big on this petite lady,1
i only gave these 3 stars because there were flaws in the knitting they serve the purpose for which i bought themto keep my lower legs warm,1
bag is sturdy no it wont stop a determined thief but it will prevent hotel maids or passersby from pilfering a determined thief could cut into the bag with a bit of effort but most maids or housekeeping staff would only steal something if they could grab it quicklybr where this product falls down is the lock it is small and weak and could easily be pried open in seconds with a pair of screwdrivers cutting into the bag is possible but would take some time popping the lock however would take mere secondsbr im hoping to find a better lock that will work with this bag otherwise the whole thing is a wasted effort,0
the length was fine but when i put my forefoot into the toe box i looked like id had my fifth toe amputated and was trying to wear shoes 6 sizes too small they went back,0
seemed cheaply made weird elastic waistband not very flattering,0
pants are to big for a 4cl fit like clown pants,0
soft and lightweight is correct small hats over all if you have hair full with volume this is not the har for you contemplating sending these back such a disappointment,1
low guality,0
the plastic ones seem like the lid to the dome where the image was inserted may pop off the little metal one no complaints kept the small metal one on the outside of my purse and the bigger one on my epipensmedical emergency case,2
ordered medium 53 and 135 lbs dd chest fits great falls just at the knee and has an attractive drape material is stretchy and has somewhat of a yoga pants feel as opposed to other msbasic dresses i have purchased,2
these are very comfortable and i would happily recommend them except for the hideous colors neon light green neon orange neon blue that i received honestly i thought the 34assorted34 colors would be the ones represented in the picture,1
the back is too sheer the shape is not too flattering and the sm was a bit too large even for me,0
came way to small,0
love it great quality and looks amazing my only complaint is that it doesnt stay closed i thought eventually it would break in and it still might but it just stays open love it none the less,2
the material is soft and the pajamas are nice but the pajamas must be a delicate fabric they got a hole after only a few wears this fabric should hold up better than a few wears,0
these feel great when you first put them on but when walking for any distance even on our apartment carpet i can tell that these do not have sufficient underfoot support perhaps a replacement insole would help,1
i didnt expect this set to be the type of fabric that it is i dont like the way they feel on my skin especially during workouts i feel suffocated by them they pretty much immediately went into the donation pile,0
overall the leggings are really good quality and the print is clear but they are really baggy i ended up having to put extra elastic on the waist band because they kept falling im typically a small and these fit me as if they were a medium,1
i purchased the grey color sleeveless dress the quality of the material is not good and it is seethrough but the style is pretty cute though and size is right,0
i ordered a 1x since some reviews said it ran a little small holy smokes i usually wear a l xl so i know what those sizes look like this pajama set looks like a small very small big disappointment,0
good but gets rough and cheap after couple of washes and drier makes small balls of lint on it,1
wayyyy too big my i suggest ordering a size down,1
love this ring i get compliments when ever i wear it,2
broke fairly quick after wearing a few days,1
as advertised heavy duty metal parts very pleased,2
loved it but it fell off lost it waaaah,1
cheap fabric and very tight fitting on me,0
didnt look like the picture look very cheap going to use them as house shoes,0
over priced,1
love this romper fits well without being really baggie i am big busted to i had trouble finding a romper that fit in the chest with out being oversized everywhere else great color too,2
i just received this and tried it on and i love it it fits perfectly i was super hesitant to buy a swimsuit online but im glad that i did i am plus size and my stomach is the biggest partthis suit looks really good im very happy with my purchase,2
i didnt know it would be shiny i like it though,1
the color is a very dark navy blue almost black and not what i expected,1
this watch band arrived today and i immediately put it on my seiko ssc007 which previously had a metal bracelet and then an inexpensive leather band that fell apart after a few months its like having a new watch and looks much dressier the leather is highquality and the stitching is wellcrafted with this band the watch can be worn with a tshirt and jeans or businesscasual wear my one contention is that i thought the band was made in austria but it turns out it was made in china regardless this does not detract from the quality of this product,2
these are so small i wear a shoe size 8 and these socks are supposed to fit comfortably they are thin tight and feel cheaply made i gave them to a neighbor girl thats 10 years old and she loves them and the way they fit buyers beware,0
thought it was a thicker vinyl,1
first pair of basketball shoes and she loves them they make her jump higher and got her first basket in a game haha very comfy she says get at least a half size larger though glad i did,2
this is a really cute jumpsuit but it is cut really small i wear a size 8 i contacted zappos and asked what size i needed to order they told me a medium would be fine wrong i couldnt get it over my hips i sent it back and ordered a large it is still snug large is the biggest size available curvy girls beware this one may be better suited for the model thin onesbr another area of concern is the tag that came with it it says the item may contain cancer causing chemicals this is very unsettling i will not be wearing this,1
for reference i am curvy with some muscle approx 140 lbs and 34 d bust i bought this dress in hopes of wearing it to a laid back wedding but it didnt quite work out like i hoped the color was beautiful and the fabric was so comfortable and soft my only two complaints were that the size i ordered was a touch too small i ordered my usual size that i would order in a store so it was not as flattering on my figure my second complaint was that it was a touch too short for my liking which is hard to do because i am 54its hard to find shorter items it came right to my ankles all in all i think if i had ordered a size up i would have been fine but i was running out of time,1
didnt like the material and the size of the sleeve was big not as size of small,0
i ordered a small and it looked like a extra large nice colors,0
somewhat smallersince it is baggy it became a regular sizecan use,1
this is a well made article the stitching is great the zipper is not quite sturdy enough for the depth of the material i would replace for better quality zipper also the material is thick so i would not consider for warm weather wear i ordered 2 sizes up usually wear ml,2
gave this as a gift for christmas package was shipped to recipient the lavender was a bit too strong so she couldnt have the booties out of the container for very long the product seemed to me overpriced for what was received i would not recommend this product to friends for purchase,1
i love this leopard totes umbrella it opens and closes automatically you have to still wrap the extra wide umbrella tie strap to confine it so you can put it in the cloth case what i really like about this umbrella is that it has a upf 50 to guard you from sun exposure it also keeps you cooler another feature i like is the fact that it repels water and i love the leopard spot print i also like the wrist strap so that when you dont need to use it it is easy to carry and frees your hand to hold more important things like childrens hands i am happy as a clam with this umbrella i should stay dryer and cooler and should not get sun damage on my fair skin,2
the 550 have more of a relaxed fit perfect when you dont want them tightbr this pair fit bigger than my other 550 feel like 32x34,1
nice scarf but very thin you have to be careful around the ends because it can start unraveling,1
this belt works great after 2 months of use it seems well constructed and the ratchet effect if very satisfying ill most likely be buying some more colors soon,2
not real durable 8 time use,0
good color logo and fabric just cut small through the bust,1
my favorite gloves of the season they look so classy theyre warm and utilitarian,2
i ordered size 1214 since my usual size wasnt available and thought going a size bigger may not be too badbr br i could not get the dress past my chestbr br it was that tiny i was very disappointed with this dress i ended up giving it away,0
much too large,0
its beautiful but is very sheer,1
too tight and snug,1
goes great with my 1920s outfit,2
i love the color and style but way too small im usually float between 859 i bought the 9 and i think size 9510 would be just right bummed because overall i really like these,1
they are a christmas present so i havent given them to my stepdaughter yet but i have to say these are not leggings they are sweatpants and i stupidly didnt read the reviews before purchasing so now im wondering if i should just give them to her now that way i can return them if they fit badly like the others say the idea is cute but execution is poor,1
product is not the same as picture not really sure its even real leather looks cheap,0
this color looks like a surgical scrub top and the material in the back is stretchy,0
its not true to size,0
i love m rena leggings but this sender is sending the classic cheaper leggings instead of the more pricy tummy tuck high waist the classic leggings have a thin waist band that sits below your belly button and the tummy tuck has a think band that sits above your belly button its still a great pair of leggings but be careful if you want whats pictured,0
it wears okay but the color is very dark blue not the same blue as the picture shows,1
the yellow plastic is transparent not at all like the picture,0
i wear a 1012 and i bought an extra large which is a 14 to small cute overalls,0
i love these theyre super cute incredibly comfortable and very warmbr br i gave 3 stars because after only 2 months of use they have almost completely fallen apart im the type of person that wears my slippers whenever im in my house these are not meant to be worn frequently it seems they have practically disintegrated,1
it runs small and is fitted,0
love the color and texture but the fit wasnt flattering sleeves too long also,1
good,2
the item came as described and fit true to size but the material is cheap and the dress is cheap and the pockets dont lay right on the sides,1
love,2
my grand daughter put them on immediately after they arrived wore them all day everyday even to school great boots,2
size4 should be smaller for teen girl,1
buy these for work love lee but these shorts didnt seem to fit as good as ones i bought a while ago,1
i want my money back i have sent back two pair of shoes both are very small they are not true to size i dropped them off at khols and no refund byer beware and i cannot find a way to contact the seller,0
expect bulge under armpits also runs small,0
the color and material was to my liking cool and non binding love it,2
these are really great shoes top quality materials and workmanship great looking the silver bling is awesome and they are super comfortable the stocking is snug but not tightgreat arch support love these shoes,2
really cute earrings but they came bubbled like the other reviews said its too late to order another set before valentines,0
these are the most comfortable shoes ive ever put on my feet,2
material is very thin low quality returned it,0
i think the construction of these glasses is of but when i received them i was a little confusedbr br first the packaging is wonderful the little case they come in is super high quality and the glasses came wrapped in protective packing material as well they have ombre style lenses that are darker at the top and lighter at the bottom but the arms o the glasses are black while the rest of the coloring is blue it reminded me of let me just date myself real quick zenon girl of the 21st century they arent terrible looking on but my style is less space rockstar and more boho chic so the style just isnt for me,1
just poor quality and design overall,0
the fabric is very nice not too stiff and the sleeves fold so you can adjust them as a child grows the style also allows for the childs growth as it goes from a coat to a shorter jacket very pleased,2
came broken and with the wrong stone color,1
i got this necklace for my sisters birthday it was all and more than i expected very dainty looking but seemed sturdy i will check in with her to see if it stand the test of time the imprinted piece was very clean looking just like it is pictured i would recommend to someone,2
very fragile but like them and they dont irritate my skin,1
grandson likes,2
tight fitting in the legs and thighs plenty big enough in the waist,1
this is a high quality replacement watch band the material feels nice against your skin and will last,2
didnt really fit wore them once and gave them away,0
these are just ok the fabric is too thin and you get what you pay for im returning,1
this dress was a darker black where as i thought the dress in the photo looked more dark gray i had to return it because it was sent to me with a hole in the front i was very disappointed because other than the reasons listed i was excited to wear it it was a great length good quality fabric and has nice pockets,0
i read the reviews in which many stated that the sweater was tight so i ordered a large well i ordered the large but it was a tad too big also the black sweater with black pants was not a good look i decided to return the black sweater with purple colored hearts and order the lavender colored sweater with black hearts in a size medium instead,2
i purchased this for my grandsons 2nd birthday its really cute very soft and fits very well true to size,2
too big for my head,1
snaps are cheap trying to return and getting error message,0
videoid840b527ee8ebdfcbaeb6a743d25dcb13 they are exactly as pictured because lets be real most of us saw the facebookig ad with this shoe people were paying 125 because they dont seem to realize most of this stuff comes from the same place china so i came to amazon and look at that the same shoe at a third of the cost listen people being lazy about researching a product is never helpful for your pocketbookbr br anyway they look nice but they definitely have some weight to them so if youre used to timberlands and shoes like that you may not notice however i prefer lighter shoes so it was very noticeable for me ill wear them when ill be sitting i wouldnt recommend for walking primarily due to the fact that the bottom is more a slippery plastic than rubber as you can see in the video and the grooves are not deep enough to keep you from slipping this would definitely give you that plastic house shoe in water slip if you stepped on wet flooring unless youve got something to add grip to the bottom dont do it its a daytime sunny weather profile shoebr br its a nice shoe otherwise,1
bought for my sons girl friend for christmas she loved it,2
the ends are too small for my glasses i emailed their customer service line about the issue and its been over 24 hours with no response i tried looking at previous reviews for instructions to modify the strap but it just refers you to contact customer service please post the solution to this issue beware if you have glasses with a wide end on frames this strap will not fit,0
tiny but beautiful my only bad comment is that its starting to change colors and ive only worn it twice,1
the seams make it super hard to use for my purpose adding iron on vinyl beware,1
i like the material somewhat large but looks good with leggins and a belt,2
did not like the material,1
so this is weird it is really cute and very comfortable i ordered a large i am usually a medium to large in casual shirtsbr br however the material is just weird it is also kind of shiny or at least has a sheen to it definitely not a sweatshirt also the neckline doesnt sit flat it loses its shape quickly the bottom is more fitted than the top wish it was more of a tunic than what it isbr br that said i liked it enough to keep wearing it and not return itbut not enough to purchase the other stylescolors that i had placed into my cartbr br i guess you get what you pay for,1
the suspenders worked great for the only time my daughter got to wear them they broke after just one use,1
it was ok but not as long as i expected and too large in most areas bought two sizes up as suggested,1
great idea warm fleece hat but the opening for the ponytail is much too low,0
these socks are small and not sized for the average adult womans foot i wear a 75 shoe and this sock did not fit as it should i had to pull and stretch them a bit to get it to fit my heel and then they ended up sliding a bit under my foot they are thick and warm but would be better suited for kids who wear about a size 5 shoe or smaller,0
i was hoping these would be as comfortable as some others i have they arent they dont give the support i need i am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day,1
love them,2
perfect fit great material doesnt fade in the wash would buy again well worth the price,2
when i got the hat the flaps that attach to the buttons were half torn off which is no problem for me cause i can sow them back on other than that the hat looks very good,1
didnt match the description,0
great at first a bit tight but the leather stretched out and the rubbing on that healed corn stopped so they became quite comfortablebr i am glad i did not have to keep getting wide shoes which wrinkle and look bad there are some man made nonleather parts on the uppers and thats why they only get 4 stars id also like to know which parts are nonleather it seems most of the upper is leather the main parts,2
not as expected,1
ive had a few selfwinding watches in the past and all of them last a few days without wear and still keep ticking this one wont even make it a day pretty disappointing for this price point the watch is beautiful much more so than in the picture the band is a little on the stiff side kind of a plastic feel but i assume itll soften up with time the stitching on the band is already fraying slightly after just a couple weeks of wearbr br the anodized blue is stunning and the case size is just right for mebr br form is great but this watch clearly isnt going to stand the test of time this watch should last a minimum of two days without wear and keep ticking fossil can do better than this,1
nice shirt got lots of compliments on it,1
nice bras but quite a bit smaller than expected,2
thought they were for children but actuallyadult size,1
fit was great and as expected however its headlined as padded and i expect padded to mean it provides a bit more support or push up they simply stuck a flimsy extremely thin piece of fabric between the lining,1
cute but ran huge i can still wear this to work but will need to take it in the fabric looks nice but is a bit thin and too stretchy,1
nothing fancy but fits well and basic dark colors,1
not only were there several small runs in the seem at the foot but at the top bank the elastic started breaking off in tiny elastic threads i did like the control but was disappointed with the fact that they wont last long for the money i spent on them,0
it makes me want to wear bat jewelrybr and now i do,2
i just got my umbrella out of the mailbox the first thing when i opened it and put it up it would not stay open unless i forcibly pushed it i thought i can do that then i had a hard time getting it down small enough to put in the cute bag i actually mashed my finger i thought i can do that but when i was zipping the bag and the pull broke i thought im not doing it not worth even sending back in the trash it goes,0
memory foam forgets its firmness about a month or two in a year in the slippers are all but done would not purchase this brand again and strongly recommend against purchase,0
i dont know how anyone could classify this as a dress when it doesnt come down past my butt cheeks ruined my whole night,0
i really like the fabric and the the look however it shrank when i washed it which was not what i was expecting so now it stops right above my pants a little annoying but not enough that im dissatisfied,2
i love these pants high rise and very comfortable,2
i returned this it smashed my chest to the point of being unwearable,0
one shoe was smaller crooked,0
i do not recommend this product though it was beautiful and fit perfectly the product arrived with a broken zipper the zipper did not close the teeth and it would also zip the fabric because of its poor design,0
this dress is somewhat of an enigma the top is a tad tight not uncomfortably so although i have a smaller bust so if youre well endowed it would definitely be too tight the colors are also much duller in person than i thought theyd be so it looks more frumpy than i had hoped for i managed to spruce it up with a brightly colored belt the belt that comes with the dress is practically unusable since it is so short you can barely tie it and it is the exact same material so it just blends in anyways the length of the dress is perfect exactly what i wanted and the skirt is nice and full and flowy overall a comfy somewhat bland dress,1
these are beautiful comfortable to wear and have a nice sparkle to them i like them very much and would highly recommend to anyone who asks these earrings are nice enough i would spend 60 in a store without flinching as they are very high quality costume jewelry,2
the fit and style are as i expected but the colors arent as vivid in person as they are in the online photo,1
i have very thickslightly longer than shoulder length hair hard to get my hair spread evenly and then roll and snap it without straggler pieces coming out or uneven ends sticking up in odd places a decent and easy product for thin or medium thickness hair loved the concept,1
my daughter loved it fits perfectly only thing is the lettering and designs peel off very easily,1
loose,0
i like how different it is from most purses although it is very unstructured if that makes sense its not going to stand up anywhere think of it more as an attractive backpack,2
much larger than the size chart,0
exactly as described,1
this would be five stars except that the belt slides a bit so it gets loose otherwise perfect 3 compartments are great perfect size not too big not too small great price,1
nice looking very narrow fitting can not wear a sock feet get a bit hot even though 34breathable34,1
i purchased an xxl these overalls are light weight comfortable and fit as expected however the fabric is very thin and may wear through quickly also the button is sewn onto the outside of the bib this means that when buttoned you end up with a long strap hanging down the outside of the bib even though i am fairly tall at 57 i had to put the button in the third hole leaving a lot of excess strap what i did see photo is tie a loop around the button and the strap can go inside the bib or stick out poor design and not great quality but i like them anyway,1
does not fit all sizes,0
beautiful purse feels like real leather zipper compartments work well i am very pleased with this purchase,2
these earrings are ok they are not of the best quality,0
super soft materiel light and breezy beautiful colors as well but based on size chart i ordered a large its too big and the dress pattern i want isnt offered in medium so i will find a seamstress and have the dress taken in,2
these earrings were not as glittery and classy as i thought i kept them because it would take too much to just send them back,0
while the dress is gorgeous i ordered a size up and it was still too small plenty long extra full fabric quality was fantastic as the next size up is way way more in price im just going to return it we will rethink my halloween outfit i was trying to do a family theme as i ordered my daughter an elena dress and my newborn a knight crochet outfit was searching for my toddler a wizard outfit we may just dress up in pairs instead i feel i should add that the smallness is in the bust area,1
looked kind of goofy on me your results may vary has that very 70s look to it promptly returned this item,1
nice,2
i like to run 5k and 10ks the fit of the nike air max complement my gait and foot shape well as with any running shoe i would definitely try them on in a store before purchasing online that said i found the price on amazon to be better than i could find locally shipping and packaging were both excellent,2
i love the idea of this dress a simple yet trendy item to throw on when planning an entire look is just too much the tassels at the bottom are adorable cute touch that elevates this basic teeshirt dress to something special you can wear it with boots and a sweater in the winter or sandals and sunglasses in the summer its extremely versatile and im all about that my only issue with the dress is the quality of the fabric eve though i didnt put the garment in the dryer it is pilling those little balls that form on cheap fabric i washed it per the directions on the tag and still ought a few wears out of it now i need to get the pilling off in order to wear it you do get what you pay for though its cute i can get the pilling off and still wear it this would be the perfect dress to travel in too was it with a belt a denim jacket or even a leather jacket and flats and youll breeze through the airport looking so chic that people will ask where you got such a cute dress you can simply coyly smile and say something witty im not witty in the airport but maybe you are maybe you can say the perfect witty thing before jetting off to your destination,1
received before expected date works very well,2
i am unhappy with these shoes my daughters feet hurt after less than thirty minutes of wearing them the cushioning is minimal she said she could feel the pebbled concrete through these soles i will buy insoles to see if they help but ill still be unhappy because i will be spending more money than i expected to pay on this purchase after i purchased these the price shot up over an extra 1000 and thats why im writing this negative review my family used to love asics gts but the love affair is over,0
way tight on my temples gave them to my 8 year old,1
they dont share with you how big adidas runs here but on their main website they do ordered my daughters normal size and it was two sizes too big,1
these shoes are gorgeous i have to admit i have a brogue and oxford problem i probably own 35 pairs of oxfordsbrogues i was looking for a two tone that i could wear with my work pants but still be eye catching these look amazing with pants leggings skirtsdresses and even shorts basically i have found many ways to utilize them in my wardrobe they heel is higher but it actually adds some arch support to the design there is no odd smell to them or crumbling rubber sole the laces are stiff and needed a lot of fussing but not enough to remove a star if the brand can last a few months on my feet i will buy another color,2
very comfortable jacket and a lot easier to pack in the bike,2
i brought these earings for my 17 year old son thinking they were the size as advertised lol but they are soooo little they have to be for a infant so i gave them to my niece,0
the top sent was completely different from the one pictured very disappointed,0
extremely see through and thincant imagine wearing them in public,0
paid 3200 for these slippers and the insoleinserts were missing asinb074jplkq6 dearfoams womens chunky stripe knit bootie black l medium us,0
very pretty nose screw but be careful of the petals as they have a sharp point on each of them which can pierce your nose and cause bleeding other than that it is attractive,1
the neck line is all wrong not really a v very very wide neck line looks bad,0
sent back,0
friends loved it,2
i was slightly disappointed in the color of the product i had expected more of the neon lime green shown in the photo i received more of a kermit green short of that the construction seems very sturdy and holds up has a surprisingly amount of room in the pockets i plan on using this for all my dog adventure poop bags treats for days folding water bowl wetnaps i received this product at a discount for an unbiased review,2
i have rated this product before and still 5 stars i wore 511 for years but their guality has slipped a lot propper has maintained guality and price the only draw back is the back pocket is straight across and i prefer a slash pocket like 511,2
the suede quality is inferior to my other boots and shoes that is by brand,1
size is ok but the fabric is not as good a quality as what is pictured,1
grand daughter loves it,2
i agree with the other reviewers here unlike most of the seychelles shoes i own these run very large in the fit of the heel i will probably need heel grips as well as shoe pad insert to make them comfy but i like that the toe area isnt too tight i bought 12 size up so that there would be no length issues but i probably should have purchased my true size,1
i replaced the rubber band that came with my new watch a gift as i need an extra long band big wrists and i prefer metal bands this band fit without adjustment this is a nice heavy watch band so far i am extremely satisfied,2
i can not find 16 slims in stores i was so happy to find these here and for this price i am very pleased with these jeans they fit my son great they look great,2
it looked nicer on line but its okay,1
ripped fast,0
its an owlits cute it tells the time and its a real conversation openerwhats not to love if you have a super sensitive neck you may want to switch out the chain only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is because sometimes it flips over but i do move around a lot and generally wear it for a good 1214 hours a day if i lost it i would buy another so i would definitely recommend,2
the zipper came off the top the first time my son zipped it up,0
washed once in cold water and the red ran all over the white lettering cant wear again if you buy plan on it being a one time wear shirt,0
cute little face mask it fits my daughter well and has held up in the wash,2
the leather seem fine but the actual buckle broke just after the return by date i wasted 18,0
i have a skinny wrist i did not expect it to be so big had to give it to my mom,0
no where near true to size,0
este tipo de calzado es muy versátil y a mi bebe le encanta para todo tipo de evento,2
beautiful bras little on small side always bought vanity fair but wanted to try something different i would order these again,2
this is a horrible belt the buckle came off just after the return window closed keep your money,0
i like them i use them for work,2
the material is not as expected or look in the picture dont try it yet the look of it is disappointing and the straps look like bra when in it i might give a bother review if feel better about it,1
i gave it two stars because its pretty however the clock is running slow and ive only had it 3 hours,0
these were very soft and a medium weight fabric they just wouldnt stay on my head since i have hair maybe not sure so i returned them maybe they work if no hair but unsure,1
very elegant dress,2
i ordered this to wear with a dress for a wedding its pretty but to small it did not fit like i thought it would,1
my black studs showed up a few days earlier than expected awesome they looked amazinglike the real thing the metal is great and the stone is flawless i ordered the black stones on black metal and received the black stones on silver metal but they still look so amazing for the low price this is well worth the price if youre looking for some reasonably priced earrings that look as amazing as the real thing then you need to order now,2
poor fit cheap plastic lenses are ok at best one more time in my life you get what u pay for,0
i thought i couldnt go wrong on such a simple charm but the issue is that they dont smooth the edges and so theyre all too sharp,0
bought these for my husband because he wanted no show socks he like them but they are not no show enough,1
this is really nice very well crafted my teammate will love it,2
the only thing i like about this top is the color i ordered it using the size chart and based on the information offered and my measurements i should be a medium now i realize its a guide and not a guarantee of perfect fit but i should be able to have an idea of how something will fit from the guide so imagine my surprise to see that the to hung to my knees i am not a tiny person not that there is anything wrong with that lol but i wanted a top not a dress the arm holes are hanging down so low the neckline is off so with that i can not recommend this top i am sure if i were taller or heavier it might have worked but for me at 120 lbs 55 its not working,0
bought this for my daughters birthday she loves it it fits her so cute,2
good idea but its hard to get the ends through the belt buckles,0
i returned this necklace too small and necklace was flimsy,0
this is the 2nd one ive purchased in a different pattern cute and lightweight for the beach,2
same name but different product,0
i bought this to use with my indian scout it works great i put it on the handle bars with no issues really makes me feel comfortable leaving my helmet with the bike when going in places,2
i like the pattern on the head wrap,0
i bought these because i love things that glitter and i needed some post earrings howeveryou could barely see the glitter and they were a bit larger then i expected i dont wear them that muchbut they are ok i guess,0
you dont want to go to church in this jumpsuit it is tight and shows off the curves the largest size they have available can only accommodate a 40 inch bust now i am looking at the picture of the curvaceous woman modeling the jumpsuit and i just dont know how any of the sizes can contain her if you are looking for something sexy and you have the body for this go for it,1
i will never order from foremost fashion ever again i will also spread the word to my family friends and coworkers that this company is a fraud with poor quality clothing the refundexchange process is a rip of also i have ordered many items in small that fit perfectly and the quality is great i am 120 lbs and 5343 so i was very shocked that this item fit soooooo small,0
reordered larger sizebr name is not on the outer left side of pant as in the picturehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi51azaw1xqfl_ss300_jpg,1
bought 2 grey off white expected a sweater but both are very light as in a t shirt not a sweater material or sweater knit at all,0
awesome price for these three skirts im on the shorter side only 50 even so the smalls fit perfect in length for me and waist is stretchy so that area is not tight these are perfect skirts in the summer for people like myself who do not like wearing short skirts or shorts will def be ordering more of different colors,2
such a great suit for the price very happy with my purchase im wearing it in maui on vacation as we speak,2
this suite is a perfect fit and very light i would buy again from this shipper,2
its soft warm and a good buy it fits a little large which is typical for carters so basically true to size its also 17 or half this price if you buy it on their website so not sure why anyone would pay this much,1
i think this vest runs small,0
i ordered my wife what i thought was her dream dress for our anual seabee ballmilitary ball i paid for overnight shipping to ensure it got here on time when it arrived my wife opened the box and to her horror it was ripped on the front and someone had duct taped the rip closed on the back of the tear there is a shoe print on it as well it looks and smells like someone had worn it and sent it back sequins were messed up now its two days before the ball and there is no time to get her a new one thank you gk queen for ruining the one night we really get to spend together as we have kids and cant afford babysitters all of the time you ruined supposed to be a very special evening for us with this i dont even know what to call it,0
its extremely too largecannot wear,0
the seam is sooo annoying it wont stay in place,0
plan on getting naked to pee,0
just threw away about half socks i bought in january cause they had holes in the heel toes ball of foot as well as cuff i got the black ones they leave black fuzzies all over my foot every time i wear them no matter how many times they are washedbr i bought them again cause im too lazy to try other brands and they will match the socks that survived the last purge try a different brand unless your lazy like me,0
fits well,2
things lame the back of the neck is really the only spot that gets hot on the thing dont waste your money on this one maybe i got a busted one not impressed,0
ordered for my 6 year old it was so small he couldnt hardly get the straps on his ears more like toddler size the material is soft and stretchy and would have been comfortable if they fit,0
the light barely disperses so the shade looks awkward i also didnt look at the measurement so it was smaller than i thought it would be my badbr doesnt light up the room at all,0
this is what true mastery should look like,2
i specifically bought these for my pair eyewear magnetic top frames i wanted something that i could slip into my pocket but would also protect the top frame for reference i have the ella frames im sure they could hold multiple top frames but im just using these for my sunnies,2
material seems very comfortable the seam is right along the center inside of your leg so if you have larger thighs expect the seams to rub against each other i struggle to find compression shorts that arent made this waybr br if you are expecting actual compression then you deff dont want to follow their guide i was on the border between large and extra large per my waist size but was after the compression aspect so i ordered large thinking theyd fit snuggly these are barely tighter than boxer breifs im not sure right now if i should have gone with medium or small depends on how much they shrink hopefully a lot,1
post is not good mine bend on the 2nd wearbr not to fond of small round bead as post backbr very light n bright,1
they fit great and i love how they feel just make sure you get the right size,2
i didnot thought it will be comfortable but it is bthese are the most comfortable shoes ive had in a while even though it is like working boots these boots are also stylish enough to wear out on a casual event or for everyday use without standing out too muchbr br one downside is that it says theyre waterproof but when i tested them with water some of the water leaked insinde the boot while these are great for a rainy day i would not jump on a river with thembr br it would be much better if there is enough colors haha,2
beautiful watch fair price the only issue is the straps are little short if you have a big wrist this watch is not for you,1
great looks good with my other medals,2
i bought a 4x and it for like a large i had to give it to my daughter very disappointed in the fit because the material was very soft an the padded bra was nice and thick,1
it didnt fit like i thought it would,0
too large for me,0
nice plain tshirt very soft material and feels like its made well i ordered a large and i usually wear a medium because i wanted a slightly oversized fit plus i also tend to shrink things,2
i just received the watch and the light does not work the watch was so cheap i dont think it is worth the hassle to return it,1
wish i had paid more attention to the bad reviews these are super soft with nice seams very well sewn but they do not hold up second wear and theres a gaping hole in the knee im not pleased at all at 15 i expected these to be better quality than target old navy etc not at all pleased,0
had for 2 weeks and already coming apart,0
these shoes are super cute in the photo and they might be cute on a bigger person a taller person or somebody with bigger feet but for me short and slight theyre just overwhelming they look like giant bedroom slippers im not saying theyre not a good shoe theyre very well made and very comfortable albeit a little heavy they just look ridiculous on me i dont like the smell either i mean whats that going to smell like in a few weeks mixed with summer feetbr br im going to send them back but i do encourage purchase i gave it 3 stars because theyre really only going to work on a certain kind of body i wish theyd worked i really was looking forward to adding these to my wardrobe,1
beautiful but very flimsy it broke as i was attempting to put it around my neck im a pretty slim girl and it fit my neck like a choker not a 34flatlay on the chest34 as i hoped,0
i love this bag i wear it at work outside or just running around the city its a perfect bag,2
very comfy you can have company over you wont feel funny if you are in you pjs,2
i bought the leather blue band it is not leather not similar to the picture the band is made of plasticrubber similar to the the material of the band that comes with the alta but slimer it is not brown on the back but blue all over that being said it is a nice band comfortable fits the alta and a nice shade of blue remind me of blue jeans it will go with about anything i do like it but it is not at all the same product that i thought i ordered,0
very warm but tight and stiff,1
im 383339 so according to the sizing chart the xl should have fit tight on me maybe some of the hybrid co items match the sizing chart but not this one it fits more like a size 16 at the waist on me this was not tight anywhere but the ankle up to the thigh fit well enough from the thigh up this pant bunched at the crotch and was way too large at the waist if you are appleshaped go for itbr i have not yet decided if i should exchange it for a medium but i love the fabric the color opf03 has a jacquard weave pattern its not just a print,1
while it fit as expected it was like it wasnt finished being made its very lightweight the top two zippers are not pockets just decoration im a seamstress so i lined it and made the top two zippers into pockets i gave it to my daughter and its super cute,0
theyre kind of heavy,1
perhaps this is my own preference but i wanted something a little thicker this dupatta is very very sheer so if youre looking for something that covers completely this is not it unfortunately,1
birthday present for my boyfriend and it looks great,1
i read the reviews and took a chance on them anyway the boot are beautifully crafted and i absolutely love them but i have bigger calves and they just did not fitif they should ever end up with a bigger calf versioni may repurchase,1
way too small not true to size doesnt stretch,0
this dress is exactly as pictured i absolutely love the pockets i ordered in a different color as well,2
i bought theses because after working 1213 hour shifts as a nurse my legs ache i bought the blue ones in size 810 they are sooooo long i am 55 and wear an 85 shoe these socks go way up past my knees and are too tight to roll them down if they were right under the knee as the picture portrays they would be perfect,1
really nice maxi dress the waist belt gives it a nice shape,2
this product is horrible fabric is very bad quality socks of the same are different sizes they rippoff,0
runs very small,0
i bought a small and they are way too big i have a 28in waist and the shorts i received have to be a 32 again i ordered a small and they are way too big and yes i received a 34small34,0
the material is greatbr br my primary complaint is that the ear holes are directly in the middle but most faces need a little more width to the face and slightly less to the back so its loose on the back of my head and about too snug for my face but neck gaiters with ear loops are the best facial coverings,1
nice soft shirt but extremely see threw so you have to wear something under it which kind of makes this useless on a hot day,1
beautiful but posts are too thick for my piercings gave them away,0
three stars cause i got it to work so dont have to return yay and it does make it somewhat easier for the child to clip in three stars cause i have a common suv and had to use both holders to make this work even though it says fits most for reference i have a 2017 honda pilot touring so if you have two kids in boosters you may need four or longer ones thankfully only one of my kiddos is in need of this kind of thing at the moment the first holder went all the way below the buckle clearly not doing anything to hold up the straps that attach the buckle to the seat therefore not holding up the buckle at all it just flopped over so i decided to squeeze on the second holder to see if that helped it did these were hard to put on but i guess they should be so they grip the seat belt buckle good strong silicone see photo for my solution,1
they fit good at first but after like my 5th wear the right one all of a sudden stretched so much my foot goes right through it i do not have wide feet also a little hard on the top it leaves marks on my foot,1
i bought these for my daughterinlaw who loves owls she said they are her favorite socks ever because they fit like a glove stay in place and dont stretch out or move around they come out of the dryer looking new and they are all she wears now looks like ill have to buy them again,2
the earring is very pretty but be careful as the description says earrings but you must order 2 to get a pair learned the hard way as customer service says 1 was sent in error as description is plural ordered twice and got 1 earring both times fyi,1
wasnt sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews these may not keep your head warm in 32 degree weather because they lack insulation and are kinda thin but theyre perfect for cool temps in the spring and fall and these are not just for women call me one satisfied dude,2
runs very small i ordered a 2x i usually wear xl it fits very snug it was supposed to be a loose fit and its not,1
it looks better in the picture,0
great,2
nothing special to note about it except i wish there were smaller sizes they werent singleuse and came in multiple packs at reasonable prices in the smaller range hdtv is a thing women do all kind of repair work too not to mention shorter men the world over feels like a reluctant 4 star somehow,2
returned very thin material i did not bother to put them on disappointed,0
i am 53 159 and the size l fit a little loose but i was able to adjust by tightening the tie in the back i received many compliments so i bought the navy blue color in size m which fit just right the material is lightweight and comfortable i like the length as well for both dresses i only had to use safety pins for the cleavage area,2
was great love it,2
sizing is wrong,0
love this swim suit great color and for and very flattering on a curvy body great piece and i have purchased other suits by this brand,2
look comfortable but way to big,1
rose gold showed scratches showing silver surface was barely scratched did not touch any sharp objects very unhappy disappointed angry very poor quality item is constructed really cheaply warning extremely cheaply manufactured warning dont waste your hard earned money ps 1 star is only because it wouldnt take the review without it,0
i was very unhappy with the quality of the chain very clunky for something delicate i bought something else for my nurse gift,0
nice fitting and comfortable,2
when i first was pulling these socks out of the package i thought maybe they made a mistake and sent me gloves instead they are very thick and have a woven texture to them they dont feel like a technical material but also dont feel soft or cozy like plain cotton feels then i put them on and the logo is huge and looks like a pixelated retro computer graphic they did fit my size 7 feet well but i dont like the feel or appearance i will stick with the thorlo experia socks that i do like,0
i shouldve known that the price was too good to be true it looks good wears well on the belt but it is made of cheap material and feels so i gave it a three instead of one because it does the job,1
love this jacket it protects from the sun wupf40 coverage its very light weight so you can wear it in the summer without it feeling too heavy the only thing that sucks is that its 34 zip im not sure why thats so popular in outerwear these days i feel like i got a deal with this jacket and will be wearing it for years to come i bought the echo turquoise color in small,2
just a great shirt at an awesome price looks great on,2
its gigantic i ordered a medium would usually get a large because i like my tops loose and flowy and it was huge and completely shapeless i like my tops loose but this was like wearing a tarp i cannot tell you anything about the cut and style because honestly it didnt appear to be anything but a giant blob so if you like to wear blobby clothes that just look like you woke up out of a puptent and decided to wear it definitely get it,0
just the right fit and length i was looking for quality material and workmanship,2
i ordered this dress in blue and sadly it was not the same color as the listing it fit perfectly and would have been a keeper for sure had it been the color i thought i was going to receive,1
the size is no where closebr it look like its made for a flat chested 10 year oldbr made in china clearly china sizing not usbr very disappointed but too far from the post office to make a trip to return waste of time and money,0
i like the belt and buckle but question if it is really leather looks like cheaper 34bonded34 leather was expecting more of a real leather look,1
looks and feels like a costume do not recommend very expensive to return to china has us address but it is really going back to china at your expence,0
too small and i decided to go for uggs quality not nearly as good,1
great shoe great price,2
coating is peeling off the temples of the glasses one side is white plastic showing where the coating has peeled off the other side with the peeling is showing a clear plastic i am unable to wear the glasses any more due to the peeling of two different colors of coating,0
i ordered the shirt in a 3x and it came in as a large marked 3x cool graphics though,0
fits small no stretch very thick fabric it may be nice for the winter but i live in florida and the material is just too thick doesnt stretch at all so its kind of uncomfortable,0
she loved it but you can see thru it,0
didnt like quality of fabric its too thin,0
its hard for me to find warm weather clothes that are flattering due to my shape i am busty so if its not fitted it adds 10lbs this shirt looks good on mebr soft comfy shapely perfect length for me to wear with leggings i am short so it almost covers my hips and butt the neckline adds length to a short neck it will also be great for layering when it gets colderbr simple staple for my wardrobe,2
the product that was delivered to us was a disaster it was way too small for the size we have purchased and one sleeve was smaller then the other wouldnt recommend buying this again,0
looks too gaudy and cheap but not enough for the style perfect for decorating a favorite doll teddy bear christmas tree,0
not shiny and have no appeal at allbr just ugly and not giftable,0
my daughter is an average weight and height 9 yr old i ordered this in the largest size available 16 and it is absolutely too small for her so disappointed because it did not hit the floor was up at her calves the arms were so tight too she usually wears size 12 at target or walmart so these sizes are way off do not order this dress unless your kid is rail thin or short,0
the stone was not in place when i received it,0
tugged at this all damn day the fabrics are incompatible the outer skirt rode up and shifted at every move i bought a similar item at kohls and the fabrics were slicker and now i have a favorite summer sports skirt from kohls,1
this product runs a little small im 52 130 lbs and typically wear a medium i ordered a large and it fits perfectly material is very soft and comfortable,2
im glad i got this backpack for my daughter she love it and she ready to go to school,2
the jewelry was great its the wearing thats the problem the star is very small and hard to get a hold of once you actually get it on your itself keep an eye on it the threaded bit is very short and i was constantly having to put it back on because it was unscrewing itself i tried fighting it as tightly as possible with no luck beautiful cute little star wouldnt recommend it for a medusaphiltrum piercing,2
have not used it yet but i do love the look and feel of this bag just wish it was slightly wider really 45s,2
lenses are polarized butthe frames came slightly bent and the top of one lens keeps popping out would have returned if it was worth the hassle it sits in the glove compartment as an emergency spare,0
bar too small in width and too long looks dumb on me im very disappointed,0
beautiful and quality at a great price,2
more of a fall sweater than coat,1
as advertised,2
i normally wear a medium top which is what i ordered in these tank tops they are so tiny that i couldnt even get them on since i fear that even a large would be too small im just returning them and not ordering another size buyer beware,0
i like the quality of the footbed the leather straps and sturdiness however after wearing them a few times i noticed my right foot was considerably less comfortable than my left the straps were attached unevenly as you can clearly see in the side view pic i attached i heard so many good things about birkenstock and am disappointed with the defective sandals maybe its just a fluke i would try my luck and order again in the future,1
super soft,2
the first time that i wore them they fell apart very poorly made,0
bigger than i expected but cute,1
poor quality threads were unfinished on the outside of the skirt i returned,0
videoidbf0f57123d5c37fd5d342b51a96a5ffc ive only had this watch for a couple months at most the watch started to get discoloration for some reason also the bracket broke off the watch definitely not please with this watch band currently waiting on another band to switch this one out,0
great quality for this price size guide seems to be right on the pocket is deep and works very well,2
i have had these lens for about 2 months and now they are really unusable the polarized film on the inside is starting to bubble on the outsides and im sure it will progressively get worse do not buy,0
this is painfully cheap and awful not a kind of material one would ever want this style of clothing to be yuck,0
all nykon,1
too big had to return two stars because i like the color,0
first order they had 2 different sizes in the order a m bottom and xl top the exchange that i got had the correct size but the pants were sewn inside out and the drawstring was inside returned poor quality for sure,0
very comfy,2
not wide enough even purchasing a wide width,0
the onesizefitsall was a little large for me once i tried it on in a few styles i realized i would have liked an infinity dress with a dedicated tube top upper portion so that it wasnt so hard to try and hide a bra under it i also realized the dress was dryclean only those two factors made me return it thankfully the return was a breezebr br the material is pretty heavy and the straps are really long lots of material for different styles but i found that they were obnoxiously long for other styles that didnt involve a lot of crossing or twistingbr br the color was pretty at least,1
i needed these boxes for putting in earrings i am making the boxes are sturdy and easily com apart and go back together without being too loose the velvet inside has two small holes for inserting earring and a longer slit for putting in a ring both work well to hold the jewelry in place recommended,2
good,2
this is a shirt for dads but in a female size wtc yes im guilty i didnt read the whole description but never in my wildest dreams did i think a fathers shirt is made in a female size very disappointed,0
first of all these shoes are perfect the style can be worn year round the 5 stars is for style but i have a wide foot and these shoes do not fit i gotem in there but unconfortable luckily my nephew has the same size as me and he liked them bc he has a thinner foot if they make them wider i will literally wear nothing else i gotta send in a request but they dont have a site,1
great quality and price,2
i bought these because they were supposed to be 95 cotton when they arrived the tag said 100 cotton which is a total lie the leggings i received are 100 polyester or possibly polyesterspandex ick not at all what i wanted they feel cheap and slimy my daughter loves them and wants to wear them as pajamas so i will not send them back but i will definitely not be buying anything else,0
first of all this shirt is paper thin luckily i got red so a nude bra will be fine secondly this shirt runs small and short luckily im going to wear it with high waisted jeans so ill keep it but it is small size up twice if you can its tight and stretchy so you dont have to worry about it being too big if youre a meaty girl like me i got a large and i am 53 160 lbs 36d bra,1
the soft cushioned sole is great and the underside of the strap has a soft backing so no breaking in was necessary even for long walks the leather upper is very nice quality this is my second pair,2
the comfort and flexibility are amazing,2
i love this top i can wear it to work but i also wear it out change the jewelry of course when im with the girls this shirt is for every daynight use its great,2
soft highquality material color is brilliant and beautiful,2
i love it,2
its cute but dont pay 16 dollars for it,1
i ordered these for a girls volleyball team along with other things and i wasnt sure what i was expecting but i liked the material they are made of its really soft the girls loved it ordered the chapsticks and it was super easy to put in and take out,2
would have liked to have had pictures that indicated the scale of these 34earrings34 they are very very small and would not work in adult ears which is what i bought them for unfortunately otherwise they were pretty and seemed of decent quality,1
i do like the fabric but its almost too bulky,0
when they say winter sock they must mean some tropical area winter sock theyre not bad socks but theyre to thin for what id call a winter sock,0
i gave this necklace to my nephew who is in her early 20s for the christmas and she loves it very much she states it is small enough for her to wear and looks cute too she has not told me any problems with sterling silver part or with the lock to put it on so i guess she is satisfied for now,2
im 59 140 352837 got the medium the fit was ridiculous fit well even a little loose in the top the bottom was bodycon nothing like the model and only came halfway down my hips didnt come close to covering my behind or fitting like a dress fabric was super cheap and the strings in back are waaaay too long looks nothing at all like the photos disappointing returned,0
the design is great the fit is perfect but the material is flimsy was planning on wearing it for a wedding but had to return it,1
i bought these glasses because they said they were fog resistant they fogged up within the first hour very disappointed and will not buy again,0
the words are written on the back of the shirt and not on the front but the description does not say that when ordering there was also a small food stain on the shirt when it arrived i asked to return it,0
sizes are wrong order bigger than what you actually wear the black dye comes off,0
beware these do like to turn upside down so make sure to check while walking the park and swivel them back,2
i regret i didnt use it before the return period i only began to use 2 weeks after that and all 3 masks i used so far had the smell of cigarette its so uncomfortable that i had to put the masks in front of my desktop fan and blow air to it to reduce the bad smell i really want my money back now,0
cute,2
i love the colors on this swimsuit coverup it is also very comfortable and flattering it is now as sheer as i thought it would be so i think it could also be used as a summer casual dress,2
wouldnt recommend if you plan to wear it in water water got underneath the screen after 2 weeks,0
the item shown is a hudson made in los angeles button fly jeans what was received was a mexican made direct to discount as hudson labels it jeans that were ordered in 34 arrived in at least a 36 and quite obviously a knock off i would beware,0
this emoji zip up sweater looks and feels very nice but my daughter got this for her birthday in a larger size but it wound up not fitting size 13 was more comparable to a size 78 if you were buying this i would recommend going up a size or two then child typically wears,0
its very cute but very very very small especially in the chest get at least 2 sizes bigger,1
love the look but broke after three weeks and fell of my arm in the mall,1
all perfect and shipping very fast,2
fit was true to size and straps are fully adjustable with that being said it fits just like the picture so fitted to the knees it looked fantastic on as long as i didnt move much size up if you have thick thighs and actually intend to walk once i had it on i realized that i wouldnt be able to go to the bathroom without practically taking the whole thing off so it wasnt practical for the party i had bought it for also im pretty sure stairs are a no go as well as any dancing i decided to keep it even though it doesnt work for a long night out but it would be good for a couple of hours out of mostly sitting or standing,1
i thought it would be bigger but it is nice material,1
not compact at all yes it fits and looks very nice but its also thin price is good for 3 tops,1
leaks water in pretty easily,0
this material wears out quickly in the crotch ive had mine for only a few months and ive already seen the material disintegrate and the seams break ive two thumb holes in a pair at the top seams from simply pulling them on with my hands near my hips however they are the most comfortable pairs i own and they do significant tummy control comfortable enough so that i may still buy these in the future barring i find a more reliable brand,0
having experienced mild plantar fasciitis i researched and this brand was recommended received them today while the footbed felt comfortable the straps were too snug and uncomfortable i have fairly narrow boney feet definitely not wide so these are going back i didnt read about these being narrow it seems like others have had better results,1
im very disappointed with this product the material is too thin and light for active wear i purchased this to wear in the gym but wont be able to i doubt i would even leave the house in these if you are purchasing this choose a dark color to disguise the flimsy material,0
this is a very warm hat it doesnt vent very well but it looks great and is very comfortable,2
did not receive the bag pictured very disappointed this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review,0
i return the item back,1
way too small order up,0
battery was bad waste of money couldnt return,0
very nicely made,2
these are comfortable as slippers not enough warmth for cold outdoor conditions,1
fits my money and the card slots were not a problem like i thought its a wallet and if you like star wars buy it,2
very nice levys,2
not very well made needed better quality for the wallet,0
this nightgown is so soft i wasnt sure based on the description what the fabric would be like but i was pleasantly surprised the buttons are also sewn to be very sturdy which is great because im not the most gentle sleeper it is slightly oversized so i probably could have sized down but i like this size for sleeping,2
beautiful shoe gorgeous color but runs at least a size or half size too big they are a little wide on me but not horrible and i do have a high narrow instep i have a closet full of size 85 and a few size 8 shoes and a smattering of size nine boots that leave room for socks none of my 85s are this much too big for me will have to return will try the 8 and see if that works if i have to go down to a seven and a half those will be the smallest size shoes i own thank you for making returns so easy though br br update ungpfurtunately the 8s are too small and my toes hang over the edge so sad these get to go back too,1
very well made and comfy i bought these for my peloton,2
as the title says,1
i have purchased a lot of clothing from amazon and this is the only flop so farbr the shirt is too tightbr the garment is itchy and causes perspiration if there is cotton it is a minimal percentagebr the garment has an unusual odor before and after washing,0
they are super cute her toes slip out in the front if she kicks her foot on something,1
good quality and value,2
the fabric was rough and so wrinkled the bottom of the dress was suppose to be flowers i wear a lg so i got a 2x so it can be loose and it was too tight dont waste your money,0
its pretty but the large size didnt fit me and im a us size 6,1
loved this dress it fits nicely and is a nice material thin and breathable i put a cream colored bra on and could sort of see it so i put on a nude colored bra and could not be seen at all for reference i am 55 and 135140 lbs and purchased a small,1
great short a little thin but its ok,2
would not buy this brand again,0
super comfy,2
the multiple zipper pockets will keep all travel documents cell phone wallet and other items right at your fingertips,2
my husband purchased these rings for safety while at work weve had them about 3 weeks and unfortunately it had already began to rip we appreciated the fact that a variety of different sizes were delivered so we knew what would fit the best but we will need to purchase new ones already,1
the material is strange not your typical sweat shirt it is comfortable and perfect for an ugly sweater party,1
these shoes are very difficult to put on i bought them for a one year old with chubby feet so maybe that was the issue but we couldnt even get them on him once i imagine when theyre wet its even more difficult maybe for an older child they could work better they are very flexible and thin i ultimately ended up returning them,1
i was not happy they are to small cheaply made,0
absolutely no support im not a well endowed gal so support isnt a huge issue for me but i could have stuck a bag of apples in this bra it was so stretchy returned immediately,0
perfect,2
the only boots my daughter will wear,2
bought for a a samsung watch per the details of the listing the prongs are too long and do not fit into the watch at all,0
i bought these harem pants since theyre made of a material that is great for cooler weather and i like the color that is actually blue and not black they do not fit as regular harem pants do the crotch is too far down making leg movement limited i will only wear them with the leg cuffs just below my knees since that helps no i wont be returning them i will not buy harem pants like these again since they arent as comfortable as the ones ive worn before i learned from this purchase and now have a better idea of what i prefer in harem pants,1
sound quality was off and the open ear mini speakers were incredibly quiet it didnt help that the usb port was misaligned which made plugging the charger very tricky not recommended,0
510 170lbs and you could fit two of me in the standard,0
these do let the water out but they let tons of sand in,0
they are lightweight for sure but this was a gift and shoe were not new used send in random box also both lace clips missing,0
because they stretch well they are useable but to fit a wide foot they should be bigger,2
shirts are very long but very nice,2
this dress is absolutely beautiful my daughter loves it it does run a tad big but still fits pretty well,2
after three years and three months the second hand fell off it looks great it would have to be turned back two minutes every week it needs to be worn every day or it dies,0
i am obsessed with these but ive gotten 2 pairs and both rip in the front in the same spot within a week of wearing them i still wear them cause they are soooo comfy i have walked a good 3 miles at once in them and my feet were still comfortable just unfortunate that they rip so easily,1
pretty nice looking watch but seems really over priced the moon phases is a cool addition but its a lot more convenient to just look up the phase on your phone also a lot larger than i expected,0
this in my experience runs super big im 54 ish 128 lbs and the small was big for me 32ddd 27 35,1
great water shirt used it on a vacation was great fit perfect dried overnight would buy again,2
i wish the company made xxl size because the was a little tight with cl,2
i liked the style and the quality seemed good but the item ran way smaller than the sizing chart,1
i have spent 100s on shoes and i had just about given up i came across these and decided to give them a try because i really needed to exercise and lose some weight shoes came with an arch support sole that fit my feet great i have had these for a month and my feet are tons better i wear them to walk up and down bleachers and walking 2 miles i really did not think anything was going to help me but these have and i am so grateful i never write reviews but i cannot say enough about these shoes,2
nice top,1
they look better on pic,0
its okay fits fine but is rather wrinkled,1
i was expecting a blue dial watch but instead it looks grey i own 3 other pulsar watches and they all were nearly identical to the product photo this one was way offbr br the watch that was sent to me appeared to be a display or floor model watch it did not arrive neatly packaged with the clear film on the back and on the crystal as my other three pulsar watches did im guessing the vendor saw that i was a prime customer and shipped the display model instead of an unopened one probably makes less money with prime clients so why bother sending the good merchandisebr br the stainless steel strap squeeks and feels like the ones you find on a 1000 flea market watch no big deal as i always replace the straps of every watch i purchase this time i dont feel it is worth it to replace the strap on this watchbr br the owners manual is for a generic watch not for a solar or chronograph model i went online to the pulsar website but not not even they had the owners manual the 24 hour sub dial was confusing i thought it related to the chronograph function but it was a form of military time keeping function completely useless in my opinionbr br the lume on the hands and numbers is not that bad not as good as a seiko diver but i have seen worse they dim out completely after 4 minutes or sobr br the stainless steel used for the case seems easier to scratch than the steel found on other watches my guess is that this watch will look well worn after a few months if worn dailybr br overall i am not happy with this watch it doesnt look at all like the one in the picture it feels flimsy it was obviously not a watch that came in an unopened package and overall it does not look nicebr br also the vendor didnt even bother to send it in a protected shipping box it arrived in a cheap envelope with clear tape securing the product box to the outter carboard sleevebr br edit for updatebr br i have had the watch for a little over a year now i wear it occasionally it is consistantly slow loses 4 seconds per month i changed the strap a couple of times nato strap then an oysterstlye strap,0
theyre nice enough looking and i love the variety of colors they come in but once i filled in all the info and put the card back the security flap does not lay flat i even tried tucking it into the holder but that was no help so it went from being something that i thought would be secure to being something anyone looking at it could get my info from i wouldnt order these again,1
ok so im 190lbs 52 so i sized up from an xl to a 2xl bc i though it would fit better and i studied the sizing chart and thought maybe a 2xl would be better but i guess i should have gotten maybe a 3xl but idk so i am returning it sadly but i have learned a very important lesson if it something like this and you are plus sized in the usa size up twice,0
im normally a medium im 53 and 135 and it was really big,1
these are very comfortableim mean verybut they get very dirty i have the red they tell you that they are machine washable so i put in the machinebut they didnt come clean i even washed by hand and nothing so i dont wear them much at all which is a shame because like i stated they are very comfortable,1
extremely cheap looking and feeling,0
i didnt like how much it stretched after washing it it looks kind of frumpy on because of the elastic band in front,0
it wasnt as large as i thought it would around and provides less coverage as result,0
if you have high arches like me youll have to get inserts great boots for the price my feet stay warm and dry i dont slip when walking in bad weather they definitely do their job,2
in dont like that the thumb and inside palm isnt fully covered,1
i was skeptical to get these because they were one size and lawd knows aint no woman one size but they fit perfect they are wayyyy more comfortable than normal slacks but with the same look i get so many compliments with them on i ended up buying several to last throughout the week because who in the office has to know that my slacks are really like yoga pants,2
great for wearing with leggings a perfect addition to my holiday and winter wardrobe im a size 1214 and the large fit well,2
it was ok nothing to write home about its okay,0
i love this backpack it fits my two year olds toys water snacks diapers and wipes and we even used it to transport my sons small laptop he uses for school once the print is beautiful it is easily adjustable and feels really sturdy its a little large for her so that front strap keeps it on very nicely nicely if something happened to this one i would 100 replace it with the same brand,2
my grandson love this watch,2
very cute but not at all flattering when worn there just isnt much shape to it,0
these shoes are very comfortable and look good i wear them inside and outside and after having them for a while now they still look good and held up very well,2
great value for your money,2
this shoe though listed as black arrived navy blue this was not an issue as the short was very attractive but please be wary about this item when i removed it from the package a terrible odor became evident my son and i immediately got headaches my fingers started to tingle my lips got nymumb and i had an asthma attack i immediately placed them outside but the odor remained for a few hours i put on heavy gloves and discarded this item,0
as i expect it,2
it fit well but then i couldnt sitall the more reason to keep moving and exercising so glad i ordered this product,2
fake fur,0
great fabric nice comfortable fitbr can be worn anywhere wrinkle free,2
very disappointed,0
this is not even a sweatshirt this is a long sleeve shirt that is absolutely not worth 20 its not stretchy at all its rough material inside and its absolutely not a sweatshirt dont buy if you want a sweatshirt to keep you warm,0
second pair of xl socks ive ordered socks were of unequal length in the pair i received first pair was fine second pair was not the same length as the first pair that were also xl sizes are a little inconsistent,1
not a loose type shirt i ordered up but still small wore once then sent to goodwill,1
the shoe looks good soft and feels good but it just runs smaller than expected,1
this is very cute especially for layering with other necklaces the links are a good size thickness yet it is dainty also for the price i am very satisfied,2
i am loving this bundle pack there is so much variety in the styles i am having a lot of fun changing these nose rings up,2
dress is super flattering and has stretch to it the color is beautiful and looks like the pic my only complaint is the chest area it doesnt lay flat and is just irritating to me,1
right size like individual compartments,2
too thin non lining,1
were a gift and he was very pleased with them,2
pros these are really nice bras i actually bought a sized up because i normally wear a 36 but bought a 38 these are very well made and i love the thinker strapsbr cons the underwire digs into the sides of my chest should size up a couple sizes because they fit small,2
fit perfectly great quality extremely happy with the purchase thanks,2
cute bag and its a good size,2
you cant really understand it it doesnt sound like they are saying yeet also it only says it one way with one voice i have ordered other buttons that say different saying like i dont know and no and those have many different voices and variety of that saying not worth the money,0
nice shoe very thin,2
so soft comfortable and irritating to the right people,2
this fit more like a med,0
pretty funky better too big than too small anyway just for fun makes my husband laugh when i wear them and they work with flip flops,1
exceeds the photos,2
bought these for my husband to use at the pool at the gym he said he really likes them and they do the job he is a man of few words,2
just the right fit especially if larger in the chest love it,2
does not look like the picture the short side is way shorter than what is pictured thumbs down,0
thin material not fur or even thick fauxbr wears down after a few wears,0
my son likes these shirts they look good on him colors are good wash well so far no complaints6,2
the credit card slots are falling apart because they are cheaply stitched ive had this wallet for less then a month and although i like the design the part that holds my money and accessories should last longer then a month,0
the fit is perfect but all small particles is on itall hearall from linens and its very vidible unfortunately had to return it,0
i didnt care for this bandeau the pads are round and pretty noticeable doesnt provide the lift i wanted it is comfortable though,0
i think that my eyesight is normal no glasses for reading or even distance but i couldnt read the watch the buttons and letters etc are very small maybe if you have a magnifying glass and tiny fingers it would be a good deal,0
its a beautiful coat looks just like the photo but sadly i had to return mine since it came with a broken snapif i had been using it for a long time i wouldnt have minded but since its brand new i decided to send it back and i bought anotheri could have spent to have a new snap put on but they were going to charge me too much for something brand new,0
beautiful and very shiney but too lightweight for my tastes i like a heavier watch with steel so i sent this back but it was very sparkly just not my taste or style looked expensive but felt cheap,0
the item is great looks real good but was advertised as 2234 but the one i received was only 2034,1
unattractive poor quality material looks like it was bought at the dollar store pure polyester,0
videoida51614c5ee978740a7c304d23da840b1 awful design that is wobbly and with the few pieces they dont line up this isnt solid wood i was hoping the lid would shut but even if it it it wouldnt helpbr br trust you found this review honest and helpful,0
these are absolutely my favorite joggers ever i love them more than my 70 ones i got from a sporting goods store i cannot wait to lift in them,2
snugg,0
took three weeks to get here jacket is too small and i ordered my usual winter jacket size 2xl other 2xl jackets i have room for extra layers quality was good but defiantly not worth 200 bought a 57 jacket from a different seller and it fits like its supposed to,0
when i received this pin there were already 3 stones missing,0
very comfortable and cute sizing is off at least an entire shoe size though i can make these work but wish they fit true to size,1
not very well made looks super cute on and spices up and outfit but have to be gentle so i dont break it,1
el material es muy plástico,1
these shrunk a bit after i washed them they were warm,2
i ordered this and love the way it feels however the size is very small i usually wear a medium to a large so i ordered a large it was very small on me it fit more like a small medium,0
ordered this for daughter in law the dark grey xl fit per really nicely she is full bodied busty the top is very soft laundered well she washdried it normal on cold said it didnt shirk at all the print on the front didnt peel or crack she said she liked the top because it was so soft fit her well enough that she felt confident in it she also liked the easy care garment id buy from this seller again to give the product as a gift but smaller sizes are still on the large side the top has a ton of stretch so order your normal size or go one up if youre a full bodied person but size down if youre small,2
no seriously this is the best shirt ever i bought one about a month ago and ive been buying another each week i have five now its all i wear they dry almost instantly and they dont change colors when they get wet with sweat im posting this review as im buying shirts 6 and 7br br the only bad thing is the color choices i wish they had more 34normal34 colors,2
small band that holds excess srtap breaks easily,1
i love this dress even more than i thought i would really cute with boots obviously i love the pockets,2
these are great shoes for the price a little thin soled but 40,1
love these shoes they are comfy and cute i wore them on a backpacking trip which was a huge mistake these shoes are not waterproof at all and do not give much support when you are hiking 20 miles with a 3040 pound pack on your back i also washed them after they got drenched and covered with mud from my trip and on of the top pieces fell off that tightens the shoe laces they would be great shoes for short day hikes or everyday wear if thats what you need them for i would buy them,1
this is the best of all backpacks i ever had i used it extensively during a period of 2 years about 100 flights with my macbook pro 15 per year and was pleased by the durability the handle upper holder which is made from steel is just awesome feels so strong powerful and save even when the backpack weights over 12kgs with my canon eos 5d mark ii camera and two lenses on topbr the only downside is that some zippers tend to get stuck with the inner layer when trying to zip the back quickly especially during airports xray checksbr br pity this product is no longer available i still havent found a replacement for it after i climber kilimanjaro with it and it got so dirty that i desperately need a replacement,2
in comparison to sketchers go walk this bubbles are hard like stones i thought its soft rubber balls like sketchers go walk i was going to give negative review because the balls are very hard but after trying it i was like omg i feel like im walking on coil suspensions dbr i have already kswiss timberland puma nike but sorry this shoes has different technology dont ever hesitate to buy this shoes its a machine not just a shoe i wear eur 44 but i bought eur 445 and its just fitting so buy 12 size bigger only if you will buy 1 size bigger it will be like a boat in your legs d,2
material is nice bought one size up so it would look like pic based on other reviews neckline is small and sweater is boxy not super flattering but kept for cold nights by the fire,1
one size does not fit all my hat size is 7 14 this hat is much larger than that additionally it came folded up in the size of a taco when removed from the package it looks nothing like the photo its a crap product save your money,0
must have long arms and be thin person to wear comfortably nice thin jacket,2
the sparkling part of the band is falling apart after 2 weeks of wearing it,0
theyre definitely nice and fuzzy but they dont really stay on my toes properly,1
cheap thin fabriccute print,1
fits amazing love that it allows the feet to breathe and has a steel toe amazing shoes feels very comfortable when walking i thought with how they feel and that you can bend them that they would be a bad shoe and very uncomfortable but i was wrong,2
i absolutely love this coverup but washed it once and it shrunk and no longer fits either order a bigger size or dont put in dryer,1
cool looking shoes but the inside bottom is very uncomfortable need improvement,1
my extra long manduka pro mat does fit in this the bag is very thin and lightweight a single layer of cotton fabric but it works,1
cute but the stripes are too prominent,1
this dress is described as 34loose fitting34 and even has a loose look to it in the pictures i was assuming it would fit like a normal tshirt dress this dress hugged my entire body minus the bottom of it the material is nice but i dont like the way it fits so i will be returning side note i usually always wear a medium but get dresses in a large so that they are looser i got this in a large and its still very snug through the torsochestbutt area,1
cute shorts but really small,1
cheaply made,0
the mask was of good quality and fit well,2
well made comfortable shoe,2
like the watch but the band broke already everyday use,0
this seems to be a well made hat and keeps head and ears warm in 15 degree weather but its too big in most every respect usually hats are too small on me but the bill of this kept sliding down my forehead until i could barely see i wore it for an hour outside and that was it too bad,1
nicely made fabric and stitching are top quality the idea of a largeextralarge is misleading as it does not fit my head attempting to return meantime if you normally wear and xl stay clear of the alleged lxl hats,1
i bought this top specifically for my zumba class i like it because it fits me well and it was loose enough that i didnt feel constricted,2
good quality beautiful design and fit,2
ive never wrote a review before so the first you review you see from me on this product was a typo the swimsuit is a great material but im 50 and about 132 lbs i ordered a large everything fits nice but it feels a little short on me like i cant stand up straight when i have it on when i tug the swimsuit down it moves the breast pads i dont think its really proportioned right or maybe i just a defected one,1
i really wanted to like these socks because they are cute and wellpriced they were a bit too easy to put on which indicated there might not be sufficient compression once in place i could not feel compression additionally the injured ankle which needs support required the same amount of carefulness when walking as it would when i was not wearing compression socks i just did not feel a level of relaxation that i normally feel with this level of compression socks they were returned and customer service was wonderful,0
ordered a small supposed to fit a 56 they fit my husband who wears a 15 checked the label but it also said small on top of that they are honestly not as cute in person as they look in the pictures theyre made of that cheap foamy kind of plasticrubber material and would probably make your feet sweat a lot if you wore them without socks,0
i received several compliments but these sun glasses scratched real easily when worn only once fast delivery,1
sort of small and not comfortable,1
a solid sports bra with quality features the high end material leaves nothing irritating fabric is soft and smooth on skin a must in such a delicate area when combining rigorous activity nothing to rub or chafe elastin is tight provides very strict compression so i definitely size up if intensity like this bothers you overall bra seems to run about 12 size small either by cut or compressionbr br perfect finishing details with reinforced stitching the dual straps are stitched to lay flat and stay that way no twisting or tangling while wearing or putting on if youve ever used a multi strap that twist flip or roll when worn you know the benefit to having straps stitched into place overall this provides user solid support along with the ample compressionbr br great shelf system loving the 15 band it creates an ideal shelf to hold up and support the girls a great for bigger chested women who do not want wires of any kind removable pads are also a perk if already packing some heat removing pads slims down the bustline nicely yet the fit still provides expected support during workoutbr br as for washing cold temperatures placed in a lingerie bag and line dry doing so will keep bra from unwanted shrinkage andor tangling up in gears or other clothing items to prolong life of any spandexelastin you should keep it out of synthetic heatbr br overall this has focus on functionality and finish quality which brings the higher price point you just need to ensure the fit to get what you want from this tyr sports bra hoping info can help your decision stay safe everyonebr for reference ordered m for 57 131lb 34c 22yr old removing pads helped provide more room but large would have been better option for overall comfort,2
nearly impossible to clean the band,1
1 tshirt had a hole in it,1
its a great product and it looks nice but the clock doesnt work,1
not polarized despite product description and labelorim used to a certain level of polarization and this is hardly it it beats having no sunglasses though,1
the material feels cheap there is no built in bra and overall not a fan i wore one to check it out to confirm i didnt like it i didnt i feel like it will also hold smells in the material after many wears bosoapdeoderant smells just keep an eye out for that,0
not high quality leather the belt has that slight plastic texture you find in a lot of 34made in china34 leather factories these days the tassel is awkwardly placed when you buckle up it dangles near your crotch so if you pull a shirt over it it makes you look like ahem theres a bulge there tassels are best put on handbags or they should allow the wearer to adjust it to a new location this one stays put so i decided to use a pair of pliers and pluck the whole thing off the belt looks much better without it,1
did not look as nicely as advertised pretty disappointed jude for yourself from the photo,0
okay for driving,2
i did not read the description well and underestimated the size of the pendantbr the pendant is just under 15 inches so its more of a charm than a medallionbr however it is sparkly and shiney so its getting the job done br the chain is nice and thick and the clasp is sturdy fun piece to represent your cryptobr i hope you find my review helpful and it helps you select the item that will fit your needs,2
the mask literally arrived broken,0
i love this top i was thinking maybe it would be tight in my size so i got the large well its a little large so i will try to shrink it in the wash i shoulda stuck with my own normal sizebuti still love it,1
small and thin material otherwise great design,1
good quality the material is soft just as described,2
great material and fit,2
it is a bit wobbly but has lots of room for jewelry,1
comfortablebr well madebr lifetime warrantybr how can you go wrong,2
the fit didnt work outhad to give it to my sister,1
ive returned the shoes because they were too small as the other reviewer said they squeak too much on the floor mine were concrete,1
i had to return it was too small my baby is average size in weight and is a little on the taller side but this outfit is too small that it fitted short on my 3 month old it also is button up widely between the legs making it snap open on every movement if you want to purchase you need to size upbr br editbr i was so focused on the negative aspects i forgot to list the prosbr i have to say its very cozy and the material is great extra warm for the winter days and its very thick so your little one will for sure be nice and cozy,1
these cotton gloves are perfect for a skeleton costume for halloween or if you want to be stylish and be warm they have good stretch too i am a size medium in gloves and these are a good fit,2
ugh quality for halloween cape while i was 1 of 4 little red riding hoods at the party i went to my cape was by fair the nicest definitely choose this one,2
its very soft material but doesnt hold up like the pictures shows it looks like better quality in the photo shown,0
got it a couple of months ago and its sitting in my car on the rear view mirror no signs of any deterioration good product for price,2
yes the watch stopped working after one wearing just like the eagles team did this year br amazon was pretty wonderful about replacing it immediately with another that is working wellbr wish i could say the same about the eagles watch is a fun watch when you look closely atbr the dial you can see the hands are cheap and its not easy to tell time with it ive had otherbr gametime watches that are better so i rate this one just ok,1
this jumpsuit looks like it is homemade it is poorly made and the sizing is off i returned it,0
item looks cheap chain is flimsy,0
i just opened the package and unfortunately the vest was dirty i would return it for a replacement but i need it for a race friday morning bummer,0
compared to the 30 year old originals these new glasses dont give the same supersharp images,1
i bought a size 12 for my 9 yr old she usually wears a l snug in the back and under her arms runs smallbr the material is very thin,1
very comfortable size for a mans wrist comes off and on very easily but stays put i think amethyst has healing properties but thats my own superstition,2
i bought the size 12t for my daughter and it was too small and tight so i bought the size 1 for kids and look how big they are they are wide enough for an adult foot so my 6 year old was swimming in them and the length almost fits my size 75 adult foot,0
clips dug into skin but they served their purpose on short notice,1
i got this crossbody purse because i dont like carrying a bulky purse the nice leather purse holds my cell phone and essentialsbr 1 i can wear it crossbody keeping my hands free for shopping or have to worry about setting downmisplacing my purse when out and about,2
shoes run very small and the ankle straps are huge very weird fit,0
muy pequeños no son como la fotografía,0
the color is very bright vibrant it could work for some however i feel it should definitely be listed in the description,0
the shirt is great but after one wearing the hem unraveled,1
like the look and feel but little short for me,1
the band doesnt stay attached,1
i can see why the reviews raved about the comfort very cushioned insole my heel slipped when i first wore them bought a half size smaller but they are still roomy but i went for a 4 mile walk in them and they were fine like the design and color very much after a fee months the lace came out of the holder and i had to tie a knot instead shortening the lace sonits now too tight no replacement laces available dont wear them much since its painful with the shortened elastic lace,1
the braitself is beautiful my issue is with the closure i like that it is in the front unfortunately mine is very difficult to open and close i have other front closure bras and none have this issue once the bra is on it is comfortable and looks great but getting it opened and closed is a challkengem,1
even when my arms are not big they were falling all the time,0
this is a cute dress and would likely meet the expectations of many but the description says it is 95 but the dress i got is most certainly not cotton at all there is no tag saying what the material is but id guess rayon or polyesterbr br im going to be returning it and not ordering again,0
absolutely not these cups are so strange they are cone shaped and point in opposite directions so as you can imagine it looks awful i literally laughed as soon as i put it on,0
item was ripped at the beginning of the split,0
all wide calf boots are not created equal very tight in the calf zipper broke the first time i put them on,0
this is adorable we got it for our 4yo to wear to a 50s themed wedding and he looked amazing wonderful quality i am shocked this isnt more money honestly,2
i had to completely untie the back and leave it open i ended up not wearing it with my costume it pushed everything down definitely not what i thought,0
you cant wear them as high waist if you want then to be long im 53 and i had to pull them down a little and could only wear my 3 heel for the long look,1
timexno longer takes a licking and keeps on ticking wore it into a swimming pool once and the indiglo no longer functions and it does not keep proper time watch says water resistant to 30 meters i maybe went into 8 feet of water there is condensation inside the watch case took it to a watch repair shop hoping a new battery would do it no such luck watch guy says cheaper to just replace itbr br i see now the info says not meant to be submerged but i did check the watch before i went swimming and it clearly say wr30m on the back,0
way smaller than expected,0
i thought i would get red sandals these were more pink than red the run very large but the strap does adjust the materials are average nothing exceptional i did wear them and they did not hurt my feet i would not buy them again,1
i didnt get the color i ordered but my sister still loved it,1
beautiful ear rings great quality,2
sized small,1
i purchased one pair in black and everyone commented on the shoes i went back and found this model and purchased them they are lovely little shoes that enhance any casual outfit i did not expect to get arch support i purchased exactly what i wanted for the purpose that suits summer you may want a softer inner sole for more comfort the shoes may take a little while to get here if the size and style is not readily available worth the wait id say lets not forget the bargain price and the artistry in the shoes it is a good deal,2
this is a solid choice for a casual summer dress though it does have its drawbacks the fabric dying seems odd as when the fabric is stretched it becomes white and a bit transparent given how large this dress runs however for most that shouldnt be too much of an issue it certainly speaks to quality nonetheless as with most maxi dresses it is at least comfortable as previously noted the blue is a deep shade but with a purple base more than a true navy at 200lbs and just under 59 i purchased a medium and it fit perfectly granted i am a dramatic example of a pear the only fitted portion is the top and thats definitely where i am the smallest even so the medium is an 810 us according to the size chart in no universe am i a size 810 pear or not take that into consideration when choosing i often buy multiples of something i like in different colors i do enjoy this dress but not enough to purchase it again or otherwise recommend it,1
sizes run small but good,1
i love the material of this dress the waist sizing is off but the dress is made well the right under garment will helpi love the color as well i am 190 195 5 6 and i ordered the 16 the mid thigh split is lovely bought this for my graduation pictures i bought a white and yellow the white one was balled up in the bag as if it was a return item from someone its not white white either,2
this suit was super cute and fit me well for the most part what i didnt like was that i felt like it wouldnt hold up in water and my boobs would slip out as soon as i turned my torso or laid in a pool float,1
its okay the buckle in the back is not as cool as id hoped,1
cheap looking,1
not really an accurate description of the product and to small to completely cover my chest had to send it back,0
i wore this dress one time and had a large rip in it apparently looks like the stitching just unraveled returning for a refund,0
necklace chain broke the first day i wore it cheap,0
they are very hard plastic shoes look great but are uncomfortable,1
perfect for my husband who needs to keep his cards clean and from falling out when he occasionally drops his wallet wallet is slightly on the larger size but not bulky i chose it because it had more slots and pockets than others and because the value was really good compared to others alpine swiss is also a name you can trust,2
this shirt was cute in theory but fit tighter than expected the material was soft and i really wanted to love it unfortunately ill be returning the two i purchased,1
regular,1
when i originally reviewed these i think i was too eager to love them they have a great feel and they do help with sweat and chafing that being said they dont eliminate it and in extreme heat where sweat is intense and things get sticky they almost felt like they were creating a bigger problem than my cotton boxer briefs i think this has a lot to do with fit the crotch is not a separate pouch i recently purchased some underwear by david archy with a pouch and i am having a totally different experience in comparison i cant give these a 5 star rating anymore because there is far better out therebr br if your not a big sweater or you dont regularly suffer from heat rash and chafing these are a great and durable pair of chonies they just arent right for me and i can say there is better availablebr br durability i bought these 2 years ago and they are still holding strong no major signs of wear and still have the same elasticity,1
bought this as a gift for my boyfriend i will be sending it back it looks worn im sure its the style but i didnt like it the koi and the graffiti writing is cool and it has little bud leaves inside the hood i was just thrown off by the washif it looked like a new sweater it could have been cool,0
fits a little narrow,1
visually these were just what i have been looking for to replace very worn teva mary jane walking shoes sadly though they were just a little too narrow for my slightly wide feet normally a size 65 i purchased size 7 after seeing in my shopping history that i ordered and returned my normal size sadly these were returned as well,1
the quality was great for the price however i am 59 and this was a good 23 inches from the floor i would not recommend if you want something floorlengthbr br my measurementsbr height 59 69inchesbr weight 190 lbsbr bust 35 bra 36 cbr waist 32br hip 44,2
pure junk,0
super comfortable and great fit,2
stone has very few differing tones to break up a solid look also the nifty knot that lets you adjust the size super bad idea if you have long hair that was not a fun surprise,1
so a 5xl will fit like a 1 or 2xl just so you know,0
the item is horrible its made cheap do not go by the other reviews unless you like cheap made clothing all the stitching shows there is no return info very disappointed,0
sturdy bag arrived with zipper broken returned it,1
so cute for 6 bucks embroidery is quite lovely the bag is bigger than i assumed it can hold laptop water purse wallet lunch shoes and gym clothes without buckling over great find,2
fit as expected if you order one size up very cute swim suit,2
they were not as advertised they were not overthecalf as the navy and black socks ordered further they were not near the same quality as the others only the gold toe was the samevery disappointed,0
very tight in toe and sides as if made for children or asian feet,0
glasses helped very little while driving at night very disappointed,0
fit good but really thin you can see through them,1
but my first pair then a weekday ripped on top sent them back send me a new pair they fit good the only problem that i have they lasted 5 or 6 months and now they have holes on the bottom do not believe they got my moneys worth out of these shoes the bottom should not have worn out as fast as they did,1
cheap,0
it arrived quickly in a meatal box looks impressive bought it as a girt for a friend,1
cuts my ear after a while,0
the fabric is very rough and the waist has an elastic which is weak and stretched out,1
clip broke in the first 24 hours,0
well made runs small i based size on a fila soccer shirt but compression is very tight around shoulders and arms,1
the lace is too scratchy for me but the color support is okay i will be returning mine,0
this dress fitted a bit tight and was not as flattering as i had hoped unfortunately the dress was returnedbr br the good the color is nice not as bright as photoed the material is decent and the dress appeared well madebr br the notsogood the dress fits tightly and was not flattering on the body if you wanted a brighter blue this is not the dress mine was more navybr br overall i am not a big fan of this dress but it appears well enough made,1
be sure to check to see if what you purchase if for plus size or regular this product was a regular fit and didnt fit meso back it goes not bad product but typical cotton briefs,1
definitely not sized for a woman,0
arrived in good time good quality,2
fast shipping nice quality but too big and not what i wanted not as pictured,1
cute dress for young girls will not fit anyone with any sort of curves and its very very short and im only 5 4 we had a good laugh when i tried this on and then it was immediately returned,0
the length on these pants irritate me im 55 and never had trouble with pant legs being to long so i imagine this wouldnt be comfortable for most,1
the foot size was correct but i could not close them because my ankles are too big at least the company was nice enough to issue me a refund,0
keeps me cool and in the shade,2
pretty cool,0
not a good fit,0
good product for the price but not really able to wear due to the mold of the plastic frame not being straight will try and heat up and slightly bend frame back ive bought other styles and everything is ok with those will buy in future,1
didnt like it at all material is cheap im a small it runs big and is boxy not flowy like in the picturebr i am returning it,0
product is cheaper feeling than what i expected for the price and designer it looks nice and goes with a lot only thing is the 34rose gold34 is transparent way more so than the product pictures feature,2
this jumpsuit looks great and is good quality it runs a little on the small side but i am going to exchange for a larger size because i love it it looks good on and very sexy the metallic design is made very well along with the stitching i recommend this bodysuit for anyone looking for a sexy outfit for a night out i received this item at a discounted price and this is my honest opinion,2
returned,0
very good quality just what i expected,2
if youre looking for a cute shirt to wear with leggings this is it i liked the shape even though i wish it was a tiny big smaller it is large and i ordered a small i returned the shirt though because i ordered a solid color based on the picture however when it came in the mail it was a heather purple,1
like the style but very poorly made front edge is not even hemmed it is the selvage edge and it shows with holes wish i had taken a look upon receiving this piece too late to return,0
i could not wear this comfortably it was super cute and just what i was looking for but the shoulder strap has no padding and the shoulder metal loops were uncomfortable and just laid on my shoulder in a funny way i had to return it,1
i bought 2 dresses in the same size in different patterns and one of them is a full 2 inches shorter than the other i really hope it doesnt shrink in the wash because its already almost too short to wear and im not that tall,1
too heavy to wear all day,0
love them super soft and comfy,2
i ordered this tee shirt and i absolutely love it its very high quality and the fit is perfect thank you for your prompt delivery of this item i will probably get more,2
total garbage quality wise no structure amazon has an increasing amount of inferior products that come from overseas mostly china 99 garbage will no longer buy they amazon,0
the most perfect seamless thong feels like second skin,2
i like it because it is a frog but its not what i really wanted,1
love it just hope it doesnt turn colors lol,2
i wearem to bed cool and keeps my junk together navy dudes may wear them in public but i have guy shorts for that,2
bought this for my boyfriend for snowboarding he loves it great product,2
love it going to get another one in a different color,2
the product fit true to size except length even our 6ft people had over a foot of extra leg left,1
not as nice looking as the picture,0
love the shoe but the size was too big makes it difficult for my daughter to walk with i will exchange it for a smaller size,1
been searching for largeladysized comfortable undies that stay in place these do the best so far of the many i have tried i have even ordered another set however after only about a month of wear one pair has already developed a hole at a seam in the crotch area i hope its a fluke and the other five pair will last longer,2
did not like fringe too big looks awful,0
tshirt not as heavy as i wanted and the pow screen printing seems cheap,1
its super soft on the inside but the sleeves starting pilling with less than 6 hours of me wearing it the first time,1
kind of big and dont fit all that great but very pretty to look at,1
they look goodfit goodand are comfortablei wear them as slippers,2
my fiancé never got the chance to even try on the dress because when i took it out the package it felt moist and smelled like mildew the red tag left a red stain on the back of dress im so discussed,0
way to small for her,0
merrell shoes are as comfortable as ever this is my 34goto34 brand when i need longlasting comfortable and stylish shoes or sandals,2
runs very small especially if you have bigger arms im losing weight so i kept it and the price couldnt be beat however i wonder why goodthreads has such weird sizing some of their items run too big and others run small you have to read the reviews before buying,1
this top is so cute but after washing about 3 times one of the snaps pulled right through the material and was not wearable after that pretty disappointed in the quality,0
well made but its mustard colour does not fit me i returned it,1
this was a very nice watch but unfortunately i have a small wrist and it was too big and i had to return it great easy return process thank you,1
great assortment of charms none were the same my kids loved it unfortunately the bracelets didnt come with the pieces although the discription stated bracelets with the charms recommend this product packaged in a plastic sealed bag,2
you get what you payed for,0
they were so soft and comfortable i would recommend and they are true to size,2
on the wood floor these arent very nonslip,1
it broke after wearing it for a few weeks i contacted the seller and they ghosted me,0
best part is that they have pockets,2
was way to firm and inflexible tried them on and wasnt comfortable at all,0
the glasses is good but the pack got thorn in a shot time of use,2
too big for my daughter,0
very comfy,2
5 stars except they sent the wrong one received the peacock pattern with shiney gold i ordered the peacock pattern without gold which i think i would have liked a tiny bit better since it is a flattering light weight duster that compliments a variety of colors i am glad i choose to add it to my wardrobe plus i have received some very nice compliments,2
loved the look but fit wierd,0
arrived smashed looked like the face melted the back is the sheerest most low quality fabric ive ever seen took a month to get here do not buy this,0
it says no blister but it is a lie i walk four miles every day after wearing these sucks i still have 4 or 5 big blisters false advertisement,0
love these shorts they are the perfect length not juniors short but not bermuda long they also do not ride up between my thighs thats always embarrassing,2
a little tight,1
this shirt is very thin and awfully tight for a large the arms are tight which means wearing it over a shirt with sleeves wont work definitely wouldnt work for wearing over scrubs and its so thin i can see my bra straps through the back even with another shirt on underneathbr br on the positive side its cut well and long in the arms the coral color i got is gorgeous ill keep it but it was lot thinner and tighter than id been expecting luckily its pretty stretchy,1
shiny heavy weight material looks very cheap skirt is not made well as the pleating is not consistent and there shorts to be too much material for the skirt this skirt was also much longer than expected i thought it would hit at the knee but it hits at my calves disappointing bc the pattern is lovely,0
very comfortable lightweight shoe,2
not true to size the manufacturing is inconsistent i bought several pairs and these were at least two sizes smaller,1
it has one flaw if you put your wallent in your front pocket its going to to keep poking your thighs,0
nice backpack only disappointing thing to this backpack on the bottom it does have a spot where you can put your shoes my sons are 13s and they do not fit in there he was very excited to get this backpack because of that and now hes gotta carry them in a different bag because they dont fit,1
disappointed again when will i learn to stop ordering from these chinese manufacturers it doesnt matter what the size chart says these companies whip up items that look cute in the pictures but never measure up i ordered this thinking ill give it one more try and even measured myself carefully went exactly by the chart given got the item and wouldnt you know it it measured 5 inches 5 inches smaller than the chart im done done done with this shoddy mess once and for all check the seller out before you order these types of clothes and youll start to recognize when its one of these vendors save yourself the trouble folks,0
cheap thin and arm patches not completely sewn on dont waste your money,0
yow either these run small or i somehow purchased a childs size i usually wear a 68 or a mens xs depending on the brand i cant even get my hands into these im guessing the xsmalls would probably fit a 6 year old if that helps you with sizing otherwise they really seem like theyre quality made with good materials no loose stitching etc id recommend but size up,1
ordered a large and it was tight,1
very comfortable warm and pretty,2
just dont like the cut on me may work for others i did find they looked washed out after on a couple washes i is cold water and hang dry,2
super cute dress and looks exactly as pictured and fit great i got a large im 53 175 lbs with big chest but after only a few hrs of wearing it it started to rip at the seams it cannot handle the slightest bit of stretch or pull very disappointing,0
i normally wear a medium and got this jumpsuit in a smallbr this is plenty big on mebr this is a jumpsuit that you really want to add a tucked look to the top dont pull it down all the way like you would most rompers youll have a seam at your kneesbr this jumpsuit is super comfortable and cute but casualbr sometimes i find that my jumpsuits tend to be too dressy lookingbr not this one you can throw on some sneakers or sandals and hit the doorbr on a cooler day grab a cardigan or jean jacketbr the jumpsuit is well made and the material has a good weight to it and lays nicelybr dont forget to order a size downbr br thank you so much for taking the time to read my reviewbr i hope the information that ive provided helps to make your decision a little easierbr if you found this review helpful please click the helpful button below,2
cute but runs a little small would size up 1 size,2
the color and material are nice but its awkwardly short and wide fine for tucking into things but wish it was more flattering untucked,2
interchangeable pieces in a puzzle drive me batty,1
this cloak is extremely cheaply made it looks nothing like the pictures it does not hang like the pictures no arm holes slits to help it stay in place while using your hands the double layered velvet inside and out in so thin you can see through both and i can hardly call it velvet or velour or velveteen the fur trim is small and matted down not elegant looking not even close to pretending to make it work or get by with very disappointed i have bought others and paid less that were true velvet lined fluffy fur and arm slits obviously i returned,0
i have a 9year old child with an average size head and the wig was very small,0
i like it i havent tried them yet but asics is always good i thought a little bit larger than usual not for asics but for mizzuno so if i order again i would order 05 smaller,2
i have a good collection of 2xits underwear and these are the funniest looking things ive worn by them the fabric is soft and smooth and looks like a very well made product but its sized smaller than 2xits other brands and it shoots out your package literally it sticks your package out in the air its to funny my wife laughed if you have a good size package this may not work well it pulls the fabric from the back giving you a wedgy feeling but if your on the small size this underwear may make you look big i love 2xits products but this one is not for me i do not recommend this product style to my family and friends,1
too big no zippers who ever makes big bags without zippers i really wanted to like this bag cause i was buying it for my mum,1
i purchased the 8mm hoops over a month ago and it has been a few weeks since i could put in my 8mm glass plugs they went in with no resistance whatsoever and are comfortable so i have been able to comfortably wear 8mm for two weeksbr br these however are not comfortable they snag have a rough surface texture and refuse to go through the slit cut in the hoop is much more narrow than the photos and even with plenty of jojoba oil after a hot shower and earlobe massage they dont go inbr br the cut edges are barely tapered at all and upon inspection the wood is 8mm in one direction and 9mm in another unless you have very elastic lobes and have been at 8mm for a while dont expect these to go in its a shame because i have waited more than a month and still cant wear thembr br update the rough wood grain made my ear bleed threw them out,0
this is a cute blouse the long sleeves are lace and i am cold most of the time and knew that the sleeves would make me cold,1
my sister is wearing these and they are comfy,2
the size runs smaller than expected order one size larger then normal,1
these sports bras are very cheaply constructed i also didnt care for the way they fit for me they arent really comfortable enough to wear around the house and they definitely arent sturdy enough for workouts,0
i was looking for an affordable water resistant watch for work i was instantly drawn to the simplistic chic style of this watch it looks great im more than happy with this product also excited to purchase different bands since theyre interchangeable,2
very cute but very small hoops are so tiny that its hard to put them on going to gift them to a child,1
this is not a normal large its very very large like extra extra large and if i return it the seller wil not pay for shipping it backbr never using this seller again,0
this is my first nursing bra im currently 25 weeks pregnant and needed new bras everything was getting too tight figured i would need nursing ones eventually so i started wearing them now they are super comfortable the bra extenders and clips are really usefulbr br im about a c cup and this bra gave adequate support i would imagine though if i was larger it might not be enoughbr br definitely would buy more if i need them,2
junk,0
bag ripped after a couple of weeks,0
love this and wear it often to lounge in,2
this shirt is super soft and comfortable however it sheds horribly even after several washes it leaves black fuzz everywhere i go,1
really small earring pictures are a bit misleading,1
i bought this earring display product for my 11 year old daughter it is lovely made well very sturdy its a good way to organize and display your inventory of earrings easily,2
its a beautiful soft orange i love it anf it looks amazing on my daughter,2
shipping was extremely long product does not match description,0
if you wear a large comfortably dont order a large here make sure you order at least one size up i wear a 1012 and this was much too tight,0
i love the length and the feel i would like it to be heavier,2
they arrived super fast and are as advertised largeawesome,2
bought this shirt and it came very wrinkled up so i decided to wash it the first wash the button came off,0
i originally ordered these to wear at the gym but they were a bit to thick and not form fitting at all the ankles and waist seemed to be stretched out compared to the rest of the pants there were tension marks starting at the waist going down mid thigh i ordered a small but the length still came up over my belly button im 5 9 a positive note they are very warm ill be using them as a base layer for hiking in cold weather,1
this is a nice and colorful back pack for kids im not sure it is strong enough to last the whole yearonly time will tell the straps are padded and there is a technology pocket that is padded on one side this is a decent pack but seems a bit pricey for a kids pack,2
cute cut flattering for any body type nice flowy fabric and not too sheer perfect for summer only issue was the neck didnt fit right too snug and caused bunching in the upper back of the dress,1
i ordered a size up the sleves run short and shrink when dried other wise they would be half up the forearm if i hadnt ordered a size up i do like the colors and flow of the mid section of sweater,1
thin and a little on the small size but very cute,1
these are super cute looks just as shown however they are way too large if i bend over they fall right off my head i dont have a weirdly small head by any means the 2 arms are just overly stretched out on these lenses otherwise i would love them,1
was really great until the whole right sleeve unraveled after only wearing it for an hour or 2,0
needed cotton for sensitive skin this is great,2
really cute great value and the color is so pretty comfortable and love that i can adjust the straps,2
its a nice top but i wouldnt call it a tunic its a cute t shirt with lace on the bottom neither long enough or swingy enough to be a tunic its really not like what they show in the photos,1
my 9yearold was looking for a high top sneaker and he picked this one but when he tried the shoe it was too bulky and not very comfortable in my opinion this shoe would be great for cold weather,0
the bottoms are a straight thong not as pictured the top is super cute but i have a b cup and a large is too tight and has me spilling over,1
i like some of the aspects of this jewelry box but im not happy with some of it too its a nice quality well made however there 8 little square compartments that are too deep to be practical i have to stand directly over this to even see down into those little divided compartments nothing really fits into them either there is way too much space for rings but not nearly enough space for earrings for as well made as the outside is the inside of the lid is just not great for necklaces i like that you can hang delicate necklaces there but the little pegs are cheap and flimsy and wont last long there is really no space for me to store my watches if you have mainly rings and necklaces this might work for you not for many earrings watches or bracelets,1
half of the button holes dont even exist will be returning ordered a medium and a large was sent might have still been cute and fit find but what the heck with the missing buttonholes do better be better,0
wont stay on overnight i have to find it in the bed every morning,0
the socks are really cute but they run very small,1
the fit around my waist and legs was pretty good but they are very long for someone who is usually a 29 30 additionally the material is rough making them not that comfortable even after using fabric softener the weight of the material is fine for indoors but i wouldnt wear them outside once the temperature starts dropping below the 60s,1
everything,0
this wig was ok not as good as the purple the red wasnt as red as depicted in the picture but still great product,1
the charms are alot smaller than they appear i dont see it lasting long but for 250 you cant expect much,1
the large fits like and extralarge but its so comfortable to me,2
my wife really likes this purse the only issue is that it is rather small i got her the matching wallet and that fits and maybe a lipgloss and small mirror but thats about it her phone might not even fit with the wallet inside but for a lunch date it works,2
broke within 10minutes of wearing it do not buy,0
super cushiony and soft love these very nice shade of heather gray toobr im gonna wash them in a few days and see how they hold up but so far im happy with these,2
very tiny not at all like pictured,0
these could be really great but they run very small and even if you order the right size half of them will be the wrong size i ordered 2 different sizes just to get 3 that fit i gave the rest to my 12 year old daughter they are good quality and very comfortable but the sizing is screwed up also if you want to contact customer service call amazon directly because the seller couldnt care less that you have a problem with theyre product,0
nicely made but the cross was too big for me to fit it on my ear,1
love these for running hold my shoes tight and i dont have to worry about them coming undone,2
i agree with the other review that says 8oz is way too heavy i think a true 6 or 7oz would be perfect alot of shirts are advertised as 6oz these days but are nowhere close to that the weight i could have dealt with because it would probably last a long time and definitely keep its shape the problem i had was that it fit really weird the whole mid section was loose the shoulders fit a bit tight and the waist was normal it might have been less noticeable if it was a bit lighter of a material this is one case where the heavier fabric highlighted those issues,1
good,1
bought two of these its a good productbr br however these can be bought for 4 somewhere else knockoffs sure but lets be real its not going to be very different looking at the constructionbr br i didnt buy it anywhere else because i honestly dont care enough but 1000 markup to support a us fabricated product is a little ridiculous these should be 15 max if you cant fabricate it at that price point youre doing something wrongbr br the product is fine so 3 stars removed one star for the absurd markup and 1 star for not even bothering with sending color matching key rings,1
like the double zipper and compartment for phone really satisfied with my purchase,2
the top is gorgeous and super soft however i should have sized down at least one size as i was swimming in the xl and usually wear an xl or even xxlbr the neck opening is very big enough so that it will drop off a shoulder easilybr the cuffs are elastic which isnt super comfortable either,2
this is a very soft light weight sweater the ribbed material is a brushed fabric im 54 and 130lbs i typically buy medium but i would prefer a large since this sweater is clingy and is highlighting my muffin top instead of hiding it at the same time the sleeves are slightly too long the light color of this sweater also means its slightly see through it also arrived with several holes near one of the buttons with all these problems im not sure ill be able to wear this comfortably,0
didnt fit on my large 5 year old daughter or my head correctly,0
awesome looking leathersuede italian made sneakers semi high top very soft and stitched well the fit is good and they are comfortable nice rubbery hard sole to prevent slipping i got the grey color and got the mens size 7 which was available i wear a size 9 in womens shoes,2
was great for halloween it was exactly what is described very pleased,2
it fits but its short its a weird material and personally i think the pockets lay weirdly i can wear it around the house or with leggings but i would never wear it without leggings out of the house when it hangs in my closet its closer to the length of some of my tunics,1
ok,2
its very good quality especially for the price my only complaint is that the pendant tends to turn around but thats just something that happens with any necklace so its not a big deal i am personally using this for cosplay purposes the character ritsu kasanoda aka bossa nova wears a necklace with a gold pendant i thought this would be perfect for it and it is d its also great to sport your ouran love,2
i bought it to help hold in a tummy pooch unfortunately this doesnt because you have to zip the zipper at the top which is impossible if you have a pooch so whats the point,1
im happy i tried these theyll be great pants for the park and other outdoor fun with my kids this summerbr br the fabric is thin as others noted but its very comfortable and doesnt get hot it also has a good amount of stretch yet retains its shape well lots of other stretch fabrics get looser and start to slump as the day goes onbr br i like the waist band here its soft but still can look a little more polished than a plain elastic band the pants have the look of slacks with a button and zip fly but they are soft and comfortable and can pull on like yoga pants they also have small cargo pocketsbr br i found that these fit quite consistently with their size i waver between an 8 and 10 and the 8 fit just barely im definitely pear shaped so the thighs are snug but its okay if you want them to fit loose then order up a size if you want them to fit close to your body go with your regular size,2
i had a range bag and the plastic buckle that came on it simply snapped one of the presstabs just broke off so i looked for an easytoinstall repair option and saw this sea to summit bucklebr br took off the old buckle and figured id try inserting the adjustment strap first to confirm that it would fit the 1534 width matched perfectly to the straps where i ran into a test of wills was threading the strap into the thinner upper slot of the bottom half of the buckle assembly the strap had the end folded over and sewn so the straps end was twice as thick as the rest of itbr br using a small screwdriver i was able to force a corner of the folded end through the buckle just enough to grabbed it with a pair of pliers using a bit of forced pulling wiggling i was finally able to pull the strap through and then it easily went through the other slot in the buckle bottom just for reference this strap is heavy duty and the foldedsewn end is just over 1834 thick so this may not be an issue for other applicationsbr br the upper half of the new buckle the half w the screw was a snap to installbr br the buckle is well made and the press tabs are pliant enough not to simply snap off now the range bag is set for hopefully many years of service,2
one of the better fakes i have seen very thin compared to an original but the logos all look pretty good,2
this slipper is almost 2 sizes too large i would not buy again,0
the sizing was incorrect,0
i like the inscription engraved on the bracelet but disliked that it was not assembled when it arrived giving me the feeling of something cheap,1
i love these shoes i have them in black also but i do wish they came in half sizes the 6 is a little too big for me but im hesitant to buy the 5 because that just seems too small that being said because of the material im still able to wear the 6 despite it being big because i can scoot my foot to the front the front of my foot sticks to the shoe so that my heel doesnt slip out but all in all you cant beat them for the price,2
made very small buy an extra size up,0
the skirt fit fine but not terribly flattering style it flares at the hips i returned it,0
there was a strong odor from these gloves i tried everything i could think of washing them letting them air out storing them in bags with dryer sheets the odor kept coming back it was weird they were also rough but i could have gotten over thatbr br ultimately the kids liked them on christmas day and they were cheap little gifts but i would have been better off getting little gloves from the dollor store,0
i have difficulty with my feet and getting shoes that dont aggravate my foot issues my search has ended these shoes have fulfilled and exceeded this need they are light weight great support easy on and off by inserts fit nicely and i can wear this shoe all day 10 to 12 hours with no issues or pain at night this includes days of walking and being active all day this show is so great i have purchased my third pair so i will have a pair to wear for a long time in a month or so i plan on purchasing a fourth pair to extend the time i can remain pain free while remaining active this shoe was great in airports when you had to remove your shoes easy on easy off,2
the material feels cheap almost plasticlike and is very itchy and uncomfortable it also runs quite small and was snug in the arms and clung to every imperfection it has a completely straight cut which is not particularly flattering on my pear shape its more suited to someone with an athletic build perhaps,0
good value for money reliability and durability not sure i use it as a show piece in parties,1
the straps are way to big with no adjustment for them,0
the kimono is beautiful and has so many lovely colors the material is rayon as described and it is lightweight but not chiffon like material the belt is not attached but would suffice when used as a coverup i will be wearing it as an outer layer the quality is excellent and i would highly recommend excellent buy,2
very pretty,2
im 510 ordered a size up and it fit as expected the green jungle print is very flattering on my figure quality material for the price its a bit cheeky but thats exactly what i wanted i wear it all the time and get compliments,2
they are pretty but two of them fell apart 2 days after wearing thembr the metal balls at the end came off disappointed was hoping for better quality,0
ty,2
this item was exactly as pictured fit great stood up to washing and provide all the star trek vibe i need for this price,2
excellent,2
im 5 feet110 lbsi order size smalli got it and only fitfor todlerpiece of crap dont waste your money buying this,0
awfully short if you are a tall woman the sizing was as expected except for the length of the dress was quite short on a 5 foot 10 inch woman,1
videoid41b06740aeba20db0e6bf73697b35c4e not as pictured the lens is all dark not light at the bottom as in the photo,0
did not keep the time i suspect some type of mechanical problem,0
this was awful i was so excited to get this shirt and i returned it immediately i ordereded an xl and it could be a medium at best very thin cheap fabric if you buy get 2 sizes bigger or just buy something else altogether,0
at first glance this skirt gives one an impression of elegance the color is nice and the velvet has a nice feel i think the waistband which is black elastic is a little loose my one complaint with this skirt is that the bottom edge is not hemmed not only is it not hemmed but the cut is not straight and has a bit of a rough look if examined closely now this could have been given a small zigzag stitch that would have covered this nicely i have done this before on fabric that wouldnt take turning well i gave the fabric a bit of between friction and the velvet does fray slightly so this might be an issue if you would be doing a bit of sliding into and out of cars or chairsbr br i received this skirt via amazons vine program with no expectations but that i provide my honest opinion all thoughts expressed are my own,1
product made well butterflies are made of a thick paper held up well for event and can still be used again worth the money one butterfly was creased where it shouldnt have been i the paper on a front butterfly so maybe transit packaging could be better but of all the butterflies the headband holds it didnt decrease the value for me and for my event,2
keeping their bellys nice and warm,2
i purchased while on a sale the legs were tight without any stretch for how wide the waist was somewhat awkward fit i do wear and for the price at that time ive got a fair amount of use,1
i was skeptical to order boots online because i am not sure of the calf circumference but the reviews were all positive so i ordered a pair i have more than one problem with the boots first i ordered for the black one and the seller shipped me the brown one the box indicates black but the actual color of the boots is brown second the calf circumference is too small particularly the right boot and i there is no space to stretch which is contrary to one of the reviews that there is a hidden stretch space on the side of the zipper third the material looks classy and expensive in the picture but was actually a cheap one for the price i paid and the right boot was so crinkly which looks like somebody has tried on it and forcibly tried to zip up the boots i worked in a footwear company for more than 10 years and know a good material from a cheap one i am thinking that this is a fast selling pair and this pair comes from repeatorder batches which sometimes does not have the same quality as the original batches this is surely a return item,0
i absolutely love this necklace however i had to give it three stars because when it came in the mail it was broken and i had to find pliers to fix it it only took a few minutes but it sucked because i dont like buying broken things anyways the necklace itself is awesome and looks super cool and is quite the conversation starter hooray,1
hugs the belly even when i bought a size up,1
this shirt has a loose fit but it is a very comfortable casual shirt this linen is not one of those light and transparent fabric it has a nice weight to itbr i bought two of these in different colors and will be wearing them a lot this summer,2
the dress is perfectbr hugs your body in all the right places,2
these did not stay on my feet i tried wearing them with different types of shoes with no luck i did like how they felt on but the sliding off was annoying i have wide feet so they may fit someone with average or slim feet the quality of the product is good,0
these seem just a tiny bit big but not really because thats how house shoesslippers should be the last thing you want is tight footware around the house they are comfortable and have a pretty definedrobust sole for house shoes but thats fine because some really cheap flatbottomed slippers tend to crack soon after purchase and leak stuffing all over the house until you finally replace them i expect these to last longer merely for thatbr br i only took off a star probably too arbitrarily because i dont love how they look i mean you can see the style in the pictures but they look even more decorativefroofy in real life im a guy that likes things masculine and simple,2
i ordered 2 sizes up im 5934 and normally wear a large i ordered a xxl and it fit perfectly it was a little on the short side when i sat down but i love this dress overall very flattering and i recieved lots of compliments on it,1
pants and top feelfit as two different sizes colors are vibrant material is a polyester type,1
material fraying at the sewed line on arrival and after washing still fits well and does what it says it will,1
otherwise comfortable jc,1
these glasses look cool and they seem wellmade unfortunately they dont fit me well the nose pieces arent adjustable and theyre spaced pretty wide which makes the glasses sit so low that the bottoms of the lens holders rest on my face if your nose is wide enough for the nose pieces to rest on it they should fit fine in my case id have to pack a bunch of pads onto the nose pieces to make the glasses sit up off my face,1
well made nice thick tights good brighter ballet pink color the holes are small for my 1011 foot child the crotch seams are really weird and are not hidden in the leo so you see the seams very prominently which is strange,2
i love this ring i lost my baby this past year and my husband bought it for me as a anniversary gift i would have given it 5 stars but it has a flaw the buckle part is sharp on the edges it will scratch you and pulls your hair if it gets caught while fixing it,2
nice but smaller than what i thought,1
returned next dat,0
was disappointed in the fake fur lining,1
for the money this is very cute i wear a lot of leopard unfortunately the first time i wore one of the bracelets the magnet fell out i never found the magnet so the bracelet is useless otherwise its a cute set but just know that its very cheaply made,2
bought for use as a work shirt for volunteer work not bad for the price but the large size is more like a medium the sleeves are also too short for a large and are very tight around the wrist when you button it and i have small wrists order a size up,1
my daughter has become obsessed with all things japanese so she wanted to add these clogs to her collection you cant walk very far or for very long in theseits very awkward but they are cute for completing a japanese outfit kimono etc,2
it is to big,0
pleasantly surprised at the quality although i think it ran a bit on the snug side the legs are a little more narrow that i prefer great for the price i will keep these but i dont think i would purchase again,1
warm quality and comfortable,2
exactly what i was expecting,2
cute style and great size however the glasses broke within two days,1
broke before i could wear,0
carhartt quality is great it should last a long long time i have another style in an xl that fits me fine but went with the xll for this model the fit seems accurate for me it is comfortable and warm,2
killed my suede jackets sheen nap and color i should have been more carefull maybe this is only for shoes,0
fit like a charm,2
i got this for my son so he wouldnt do the real thing but one on it would not staybr dont wast ur money on this,0
everyone loves this shirt including me,2
i ordered these two pair of pantyhose that i thought would be great for winter they are great tights and well made of nylon and spandex so plenty of stretch being a senior citizen one seems to forget that your body changes this happened to me as the large size would not cover the parts of me that changed they looked and felt so nice and loved the maroon colored one i did get my feet in them but for senior citizens this can also be a struggle excellent panty hose as they will keep you warm on the coming cold winter days,1
literally just a black bandana,1
i just received these lovely peep toe boots and i must say that i am very surprised at bcbg and disappointed with the quality of the leather they look more like pleatherso not worth 9000 bucks,0
all i heard was so much praise for this brand of shoe sorry i am not at all impressed heel slips all of the time and they make my feet sweat,1
i bought the white sweater and loved it so i bought a second immediately in tan unfortunately i should have washed it before spending money on a second even though the my were the same size the sweaters were different lengths and sleeves were very different the tan one was much smaller after the first wash the white one was covered in pills and the tan shrunk i washed in cool water and hung dry,1
material is stiff and shoulders would not relax also too big and ties are very long for reference im 51 110 lbs 32d thinhourglass buildbr br if you liked my review and found it helpful let me know by clicking yes and giving me a helpful vote if you have any suggestions on how i can provide a more helpful review please let me knowbr honest unpaid review by an amazon prime addict,1
my girlfriend needed tops with long sleeves for work we wanted to find some that fit well and look good while being pretty inexpensive since her job tends to be rough on clothingbr this top fits those requirements the price is good it fits her she likes the feel of the fabric and we both like the way it looks on her it has a sexy look when she leaves some of the buttons undone,2
first up the honesty i bought this passport holder on a whim because it could be delivered with prime shipping in two days and i was about to leave on an international trip i had forgotten to get a passport holderwallet thing i used to never travel with one but i decided to give it a trybr br i expected i wouldnt really like it and would replace it with somethingbetter nicer prettier more usefulonce i had the time and foresight to do sobr br that was many many trips ago and im still using my yellow passport holderwalletbr br things i lovebr br 1 space for your passport plus space for other things you want to keep boarding pass visa slip lounge access card everything stays nice and secure but is easy to pull out whenif you need tobr 2 the zipper pouch is great for holding your sim card if youve popped in a local sim wherever you arebr 3 pen holder means you never have to worry about having a pen to fill out those pesky immigration cards unless you forget your pen thats on you thenbr 4 yellow color is easy to see in your bag and hard to accidentally leave behind someplacebr br i have no idea if the rfid really works id like to think it does but ive never tested it who knowsbr br for the price i dont think you can go wrong with this one,2
made well and my grandson loved it,2
you get what you pay for the material was flimsy my torso did not fit the bathing suit i think even if it did fit length wise i wouldnt feel secure with my boobs in it,0
im not rough with jewelryjust washing my hands a loti looked down and my ring lost a stone ive had this ring for a month and its my wedding ring its out of the return window so dont know is it worth trying to buy another one,1
ive purchased all kinds from many vendors i use them on motorcycle rides mowing the yard and yes even through the corona debacle these are the best ive had so far they are looped and sewn on each end they are just tight enough to stay in place but not choke me speedy delivery no complaints here,2
my wife bought 5 units in jan for herself and other family members from the sirensong website apparently there is a box that needs to be unchecked when purchasing or else you you are subscribing for a monthly subscription charge apparently this charge is for a new unit each month because my wife ordered 5 units her monthly subscription charge was 3995 posted against her credit card 2 days ago this practice is most unsavory,0
super cute love the design the red is not red like the pictures people posted its way more pinkish but still cute i got black and red comes in a box for safe delivery,2
bought this as a gift for my teenage niece she liked it but then purple is her favorite color,2
dislike the size and the way it fits i was thinking it was an aline skirt but its more straight than flared out fabric is very thin perfect for summer but definitely cheap,0
love it,2
love it 534334 and its not to long its lite and airy too i would recommend this cover,2
they are nice looking key chains but the metal used for the key ring part of the chain is flimsy and bent out of shape as soon as a put my keys on it i had to go buy a replacement ring at lowes i would not buy another one if and when this inevitably breaks,0
this review is from my wife my expectations before receiving the product was that it would be a bit more comfortable the good is that it holds everything in the bad is that its itchy and uncomfortable the fabric doesnt feel natural to the skin the bra is however very sexy overall it might be good for layering,1
the mask was cute and comfortable im glad it came with two because the first one broke within minutes of putting it on,0
this is super cute and i love it it is a bit smaller than i expected it isnt worth returning and i am currently working to get back into pre baby shape so it will fit better in the future but it isnt something i would wear right now which is sad because out of the three different styles i purchased different brands all same size this is the only one that didnt fit and i expected it to be my favorite,1
nice thick tough and good looking not like other thin little bracelets,2
very flattering just like the photo great color khaki my new favorite shirt,2
i have an iphone xs max and i have to put it in this diagonally and then it will fit a lipgloss and id it is not large in size it is comfortable and looks really nice however i wasnt a fan of how it laid down it sticks out quite a bit and because of the flap it takes on a very top heavy appearance it does adjust quite a bit i wear a 28size 4 and didnt have an issue with it fitting around my waist it does let out quite a bit though if needed i found that if i wore it across my body that it laid a bit better but to wear across the hip it just didnt lay quite right,1
i was looking forward to letting my daughter wear this then i noticed right away a small hole in the fabric right in the front,0
the leather which is only kept on by staples ripped after the first use and also scuffed up my boots terrible product dont buy it,0
the recipient loved the earrings but the backs do come off quite easily so she lost one earring the first week she wore them i recommend switching the backs out with noslip silicone earring backings,1
nice,2
best bra ever invented,2
love it super comfy,2
most comfortable capri leggings that i own i wore them for the first time today and they are smooth and soft and not too tight i have very wide hips and a smaller waist and they fit great without riding down the pockets fit my iphone 11 i would consider the compressionsupport to be medium or around a 7 on a scale of 110 i also purchased the longer version cheetah print leggings and the comfort is definitely stable across the different productsbr one improvement i would love to see would be more support in the tummy area i feel that my stomach looks better in low rise leggings with some support vs high waisted leggings with little support but for the price i think that the value is in line ive purchased similar leggings for twice the price i will update if anything changes but for now these are my new favorites,2
the pants look better online they did not fit they were too small,1
love these type of belt very disappointed when the mechanism just broke out of no where pretty thin metal,0
very pretty solid feel to it,2
runs smaller than other vionic shoes not as attractive as images returned,0
graphitti makes the best shirts sean murphy is one of the modern masters of comics great shirt,2
this items runs smallb i bought a large but there no way it fit the quality of the skirt was awesome but they run small,0
really like the bag for the price the color and material is nice too smaller than i thought it would be which is the only downfall the size in the picture is slightly deceiving otherwise seems to be a good product nicely wrapped up with sent as well,1
these boots are an amazing value they are durable and my husband uses them all the time theyre easy to slip on and off and easy to clean if you need boots to muck around in these are the ones to buy they are a really great value for the price,2
great info if you have superb eyesight even if it is a bit clunky to operate,2
comfy slides look great on feet and its a little bit shiny,2
to small,0
it fits as expected but feels rough,1
i needed a new bag to replace a tumi gym bagsatchel that ive had for a few years the old bag measured about 24l and this matte black vooray xl 32l looked to be ideal for upgrading the size and providing additional features like separate shoe storagebr br the size of the vooray xl was perfect for my needs for either the gym or weekend travel even with my size 13 mens shoes in the separate storage area i was able to easily fit my shaving kit hair dryer and plenty of clothes for a weekend trip the stitching and lining of the bag was fine and the zippers of good quality and worked smoothlybr br however i ended up returning this bag and heres why the coated 600d canvas polyester fabric used in the construction of this bag felt cheap to me like the bags you get for free when you purchase an expensive mens cologne it even had that chemical smell of those cheaper bags as a reminder i also didnt like that the bottom of the bag was not reinforced and sagged in the middle when filled although the bottom exterior shell was made of a heavier 1500d polyester canvas there was no protective plasticnylon discs to protect the cloth from abrasionbr br overall the size and features of this bag would have been perfect if different materials had been used and the bottom reinforced for the price point of 70 i dont think this is asking too much,1
i ordered this in plumpurple what i got was dark red brick color it was all in separate dust covered bags the shoulder straps to the lg tote was wrapped in a plastic covering the hardware was covered in a thin clear plastic to keep them from being scratched the packaging to ship to me was greatbr needless to say the color was wrong all 3 pieces are stife as a rock it does appear from a distance to be leather but once you get closer you can see its vinyl plasticbr i wasnt expecting much for 3 pc at 4100 i didnt do my homework very well before ordering the reviews suck on this product i thought i would use all 3 pc the clutch bag as my tissues band aids tampon bag the shoulder bag as for holding my wallet the lg tote to put these 2 pc inside and still have room for an ink pen chapstick gum small change purse what was i thinkingbr my small hobo bag held more than all 3 of these put together i will carry this bag till it falls apart which shouldnt be but a month if you read the other reviews i will do a much better job reading all the reviews before putting something in my cart,0
im a short dude 5 foot 1 inch and ordered a small size it fits perfectly around the waist with no belt adjustment but the legs are way too long i cut the bottoms with a scissor since im a dude and dont know how to hem pants it looks a little ugly but you really cant tell love the material though great for running and working from home for 15 bucks its not really worth the headache of returning if i just wear em around the house and running around the block i hang dry my clothes but we will see how these pants hold up with washing now that i cut them we will see if the leg bottoms stay intact if not whatever life goes on,1
purchased for wedding true to size and very flattering great fabric,2
these boots were so cute in the picsbut in reality they are very cheaply made the materials are so cheap the structure feels like flimsy cardboard i cant imagine them lasting for more than a few wearings they have no arch support whatsoever i am returning them immediately,0
great,2
a little too big but looks ok,1
really cute but it felt cheap kind of like a necklace from a gumball machine you get what i pay for i guess,0
these are super cool and easy to install they look awesome i only wish the elastic material was a bit more refined,2
fabric is very light and thin super soft but to wear everyday will be tricky with undergarments lines not showing its comfortable and stretchy and will be great for hot days at home but for work or going out i wish the fabric was thicker other than that it handled my larger bust and is a pretty color solid midgrade summer dress,1
i really love this tunic top it fits well and is very comfortable i like the sleeves and neck also comfortable even as im writing this im making arguments in my head to get another one or maybe a couple more,2
the good this costume works great it is creepy and terrifying to small children this is going to be the best easter everbr br the bad the eye holes are difficult to see through and the mask is a little tight on the head,2
good,2
its just two sided fleece not sherpa cotton so its warm but not as warm as if it had the lining,0
the bras were very pretty and fit well but they didnt wash well at all,0
i saw a review on instagram of these shorts and was excited to try them the review on instagram talked about them not getting eaten by your thighs they were way too big for my waist and too tight around my butthips particularly the brief part around my legs they seem like really nice shorts and the girl on instagram liked them but unfortunately they didnt fit me,1
videoid7dea9b56856bc40f30ba3a3773d0db08 this off the should dress runs a little big i ordered a m and could have gotten away with a s just due to the middle section not being flattering as it looks big i was able to tuck it a little to compliment frame better just size down however great thick material nice for elegant date night or evening,1
these are the most comfortable flip flops i have ever owned i have 3 pairs and will buy more,2
i love it a little big on the surrounding of my feet but other then that i love them,2
these are very attractive on the outside and on the foot but they were just too small ended up returning them,0
a beautiful piece of jewelry absolutely love it the only downfall is that the chain is too thin for my liking i feel like its going to snap off if i do any quick movements the jewel itself has some weight to it not too much though the clasp that connects the chain is very small but is very strong had a hard time putting it on if you are a lord of the rings fan this is a must buy you will not be disappointed,2
mom loved it,2
its super cute but it shrinks tremendously in the wash and one of the buttons popped off within the first week or two i would definitely buy from a different brand its not worth the hassle,0
super cute and exactly as pictured i got rave reviews while on vacation they are really comfortable i rather large head and there was no stretching,2
pretty awesome bag,2
lovely soft fabric way to small for me xl fit my very slim 12 year old nieces,0
the pants fit perfect material is light and comfortable however the button is very cheap and broke when i unfastened it and the side pocket is small about 34 deep i was hoping for a larger pocket to fit something other than a survival bracelet in if those two things were fixed they would have got 5 stars,1
the dress is beautiful however the flowers fell off after the second wash,1
got these as a gift for my young niece so i havent used them but they are cheaper looking than i had hoped,1
i did not like the way it looked when i received it but i bought it for my daughter and what she put them on she said it would be great for around the pool and they look really cute on her feet,2
i love these shirts fit well wash and dry well the only problem is that it keeps me too hot i still gave them a 5 star because being hot is my problem not the quality of the shirt,2
so far so good band is good i expect it to wear as any wouldve liked a bit larger face to see and to help keep the face on top of my wrist i like it wear it to work carpenter every day easy to read i like it a lot simple,2
seems to be good quality just feel the stones should be a little smaller not 34gaudy34 looking but any bigger and it would be,1
exterior leather is nice but the lining and inner pocket is made of thin flimsy cheap fabric that will tear if you put a lot of items in it,0
super cute and looks exactly like the picture,2
you get what you pay for i will buy again just to save a few dollars on clothesi guess im cheap,1
decent quality for the price note the bottom is not seamed but loose thread for more of a rugged look,1
this souke cycling jersey looks different than the photos it has a banded bottom and pockets on the back yes the back they arent even closed and anything u put in them will probably fallout right out while your riding and you wont even know its gone terrible designbr the material is 100 polyester lightweight and has a little stretchbr also it says reflective but there is one tiny little reflective symbol on the back really small hard to seebr we got the xxl this runs alittle small but fits him 64 230 my husband was an avid cyclist before he got hurt and i think you can do betterbr i wish i could post pics but amazon is not allowing them at the moment,1
updatesome panty has come unstitchedjust wash 23 timespoor qualitybr br just choose your regular sizeim 53130lbbr size 6 will fit perfect,1
very difficult on and off more so than other brands ive had and this was taunted to be easy pull one,0
big face i can see comfy wrist band im allergic to gold silver this is perfect,2
nice comfortable watch would give 5stars but my time seems to run slow possibly bad battery may be looking at sending it back,1
i like it very much its pretty easy to set but there are a few flaws 1 its not waterproof this is my 2nd time purchasing this item i went in for a brief shower and it absolutely killed my 1st one 2 it shows the time high in small numbers low in large numbers where it should show the date highsmall and the time lowlarge 3 the watch is a little on the heavy side and the band tends to either be too tight on one setting or too loose on the immediate next setting other than that its a great little watch for the price i enjoy having it,2
velcro is already falling off and they have no grip so unless your house has carpet i wouldnt get them but my 17 month old loves them,1
i love the feel and quality of the fabric its very softbr but i didnt like the neckline i had to stitch it so it would stay the hemline of thebr area isnt stitched so it doesnt stay even once you put it on,1
not really what i needed to cover swim suit,0
poorly sewn was already coming apart at the seams when i took it out of the packaging,0
i give this 4 stars only bc it is quality for just 22 its beautifully made with quality fabric however it runs suuuuuper small i usually wear a 10 and got an xl based on other reviews couldnt even get it over the booty much less zip itbr i would say this was more like a s or even xs so unless youre actually a size 26 this is not going to fit,2
i gave these to a girl friend and she wouldnt take them off for days they look absolutely sturdy and are made so well for chirstmas i bought 5 pairs of different kinds for various people these were by far the highest quality very high quality and she says they are the most comfortable shoes in the world i would very much recommend these,2
not pleased with them so far they roll up very badly on the edges and are difficult to unroll once you have placed it on your head i will continue to practice with them but so far nahhh not liking them at all if it is operator error i will update my review,1
was not true to size order up at least one size not very flexible material is pretty snug cute shirt though,0
this baggallini bag has many zippered compartments and would be great to take for everyday trips the colors are relatively bright and clear i did return it however because i felt it was not dressy enough for my taste,1
perfect for my halloween costume if you give a mouse a cookiebr comfortable stayed on my head all day at school,2
you get what you pay for its a cute top for layering purposes i have had it for around 5 months now and am seeing fuzz balls,1
great little black dress for a fancy evening out the back of the dress has a little train that flows in the wind as i walk adding to the feel of elegance i would not wear to go dancinglots of activities though as the shoulders might not stay in place but for a nice dinner this is perfect,2
good boots need to find the right cushion inserts to make em perfect,2
i have these in a red color and they fit well the grey however are very large i returned them for a medium they are warm and fit well if you find the size that fits right they do not work on my touch screens though that is disappointing,1
a bit small,1
these are very small and will not fit you unless you are around 8 years old,0
excellent,2
i was looking for a minimal shoe as i walk a lot in flip flops andor barefoot i also have weak ankles so i like the fact that these shoes make it very easy to feel the ground and any uneven surfaces thank being said you can feel everything you are walking on i personally like that in a shoe so i do like this shoe i took a star off because im a bit worried how the tongue of the shoe is going to fare its an all woven shoe so well see if it gets frayed easily,2
this was the perfect dress for my granddaughters first time being a flower girl at a wedding i love how you can just adjust the ties in the back to fit she even looked prettier than the bride yikes did i say that,2
different than on the picture,0
we purchased two small and two large 34it luggage world34 suitcases to replace older worn out luggage the items are lightweight indeed and came wa ten year limited warranty which was reassuring we were taking a transatlantic cruise from miami to rome and then flying back to miami the lightweight pieces were perfect for helping us meet alitalias weight limits for carryon and checked baggage all four pieces survived intact which included the gentle ministrations of baggage handlers at the port of miami the two airports and an 11 hour flight we are very pleased with this product the only reason i havent given 5 stars is that this was only one tripwe shall see how the bags fare as we add on miles,2
decent quality great to use as a wrap scarfshawl etc,2
i kept watching her instas and i finally caved they really are as good as she says,2
i am a size 12 so thats what i ordered the chest area is too big i sewed it and it helped the straps are a little uncomfortable around the armpit area very cute other than those things,1
so its way short to be a dress unless you want to get arrested im 57 and my booty just barley hangs out but it makes an adorable top runs small ordered size up and still a touch tight,2
fell apart after 5 months first the piece that holds the strap down slowly tore apart and the the connection to the watch broke,0
the heel is loose or maybe to wide,2
much too small,0
didnt like the sparkle also the slit was too high,1
the flare in the pants is to big,0
very ugly like cardboard nit velvet as described no way can i use these with clients no way returned,0
i ordered a size 10 too small fit like a size 9 the shoe is beautiful,1
too costly plus my grandson hates them so they ended up worthless to me,0
i have bought a lot of cardigan jackets from amazon and i love them all but this one was not what i saw in the picture and i dont know what material that was but it was not like all my other ones i would not buy this particular one again but definitely will get all y cardigans from amazon,0
this was super small this sizing chart is way off,0
my husband doesnt like these socks its uncomfortable for his feet and his feet stink after wearing these socks,0
14th arrived unsown unusable,0
super soft material and fits to size,2
they were cute as first after moving around with them for two hours they became very loose and baggy,0
es un excelente producto,2
great,2
the material is thinner and not nearly as soft as when ive ordered in the past still a decent pair for the price but the quality has suffered,1
i bought these socks for my husband since he loves knee socks versus crew or sport the socks are very nice and especially love that the navy blue ones have a light blue stripe around the toe are which helps tell them apart from the black socks the only reason i didnt give 5 stars is that the wear and tear on the socks after a month is a little disappointing the elastic thread in the top of the sock is already breaking leaving elastic type thread hanging from the top of the sock my husband does have athletic muscled calves that are large so that may be the issue with the socks breaking down so fast,2
even a large is too tight i have small calves,0
dont get me wrong its pretty it really is but for the price i just dont think its worth it 1 its smaller than i expected 2 i thought by looking at the pictures that it was a deep blue colored stone but in reality it looks more black to me and 3 for aset thats over 100 the chain looks very cheap to me its a very pretty set but i think the same thing could be gotten at a department store for a fraction of the price,1
it tells you the time it difficult to set however because the stem is not very easy to manipulate,1
small but it looks great on my uniform i recommend all law enforcement or supporters of le to buy this pin its cheap and its great god bless my fallen brothers and sisters in blue,2
love the quality of these glass frames but the lenses are just too orange and color distorting for me to use on a computer under most circumstances,1
socks for pretty tight but i think they are supposed ro,2
this band seems well made but its too short for a mans wrist its more for a boy or a womans wrist,1
this is not a cardigan its super thin,0
too small clingy had to return the shirt disappointed as it felt soft i loved the look of it,1
these are a lot smaller than i would have liked but still a fun gift,1
bought these dresses for bridesmaids everyone loved them super comfy and super cute a really nice dress especially for the price seem to fit as expected,2
too bulky,0
these glove s fit well and should be warm enough for this winter season i especially appreciate that i dont have to take one off to use my cell phone,2
i wanted to love this dress so much but i just cant get over the ruffles on the sleeve they sit straight up i dont even believe ironing them will keep them down the material is great not sheer or see through at all and is good quality if you love ruffles at the sleeve this dress is perfect for you i have very narrow shoulders and this one just looked funny on me,1
very itchy material child would not wear it,0
it arrived quickly in s nice box i guess i didnt read the description i did not realize part of the jewelry was fabric the color of gold in the fabric and on the chains is different other that it was a nice enhancement to plain dress,1
sparkles wiped off immediately and after less than 5 mins of my daughter wearing them they were trash,0
great thermals are true to fit,2
seethrough but i like the style and have two more in other colors,1
the information was misleading as usual but once i unboxed them i knew immediately where they came from its a hugh misrepresentation of the rayban brand i returned them immediately very poor quality product out of china,0
its soft and comfortable but thats about it if you need something super lightweight then its good but definitely not a winter jacket i wash everything before i wear it everything there are no wash instructions on it this was washed on a light cleaning cycle basically general cycle and its already falling apart and the fuzzy stuff keeps getting stuck in the zipper i wouldnt recommend buying this at all,1
too tight compared to their other tops i purchased,0
its hard to breathe,0
its amazing what an inch or two of extender can do to make a bra more comfortable,2
fabric is nice and style is very nice but didnt like the slits on the sides and i am 5934 and it was a little short for me it should be fine for a shorter women,1
i fit a medium or even small in everything and these were super tight theyre not particularly stretchy and i dont think they realize that women have breasts the sleeves dont go to the wrists but theyre not 34 sleeves just too small really uncomfortable to move because so snug,1
these socks feel nice and have not stretched out at the top as many do,2
super cute,2
my girl was able to feel the roughness of the plastic of these rings the more expensive version like enso ring feels much different and softerbr br i didnt want to give it any lower rating because everyone has different level of sensitivity so it might be okay for you in case your girl works in construction or somewhere similar,1
these earrings were a gift and are just beautiful,2
fits well keeps feet warm,2
was too small,0
beautiful watch for very good price,2
it felt awkward on my purse probably for a younger crowd,1
i wanted to love the pants but they dont quite fit my rectangular body,0
gift for hubbyhe loves it,2
very soft and thin great for summer do not size up its very big and very long as is im usually a 1x but got 3x for comfort and shouldnt have i still like it enough to keep though and maybe get another in smaller size too,2
trim around neck doesnt look nice,0
im 53 straps are short as they go dress drags on the floor other than that its ok,2
i got the ring i loved the ring i wore it for 5 minutes before the stone fell off lost the stone in a parking lot should have known it was glued ever hear of a drill what a cheap piece of crap i bought this blue calcite ring to help alleviate anxiety guess the jokes on mebr carol levitt,0
love it,2
they should glue or secure the rubber protectors they come off easily without knowing it and scratch your lens,1
comfortable,2
it doesnt fit snugly and material is the type that kind of stretches out and hangs so she has droop ok texture im hoping with a wash they fit a little better or perhaps i needed to size down,1
good size and i prefer the id section on the outside wish there was a way to separate bills from change but it serves me well,2
a little too tall for my taste so i ended up gifting them the size runs on the large side i wear a 9 and my backs were constantly slipping out,2
product was slim cut and too clingy,1
i purchased these shoes specifically to use on the rubberized fitness floor and the hardwood floor of the gymnasium because my old shoes designed for running slipped too much unfortunately these also slip i would guess that basketball shoes would solve this problem but i needed more arch support than the they provide other than that i like these shoes for their breathability and light weight i will report back should they prove to be less durable than i expect,1
not widebr enough my mother is 90 yrs old and small she usually wears a 89 size but these were way too narrow at the front of the shoe she gave them to a niece,1
too small,1
so stinkin cute,2
oh come on this isnt even square garbage goes in the trash,0
if you are a 1x like me dont try to buy a lxl like me it doesnt work ill give it to my daughter,1
this top is nice but too large and loose and not flattering,1
itseems a christmas gift for my granddaughter so i dont know yet but they look nice,1
color wrong,0
legs were uneven,0
cute fashion bag its not a sturdy as it looks in the photo i suggest carrying less to prevent popping the straps due to weight,1
as i said the chain is perfect and shiny the spring ring is another story it is small but the connector is terrible in the picture itbr shows a flat link the goes into the spring ring my necklace didnt have one so it connects right into a ring it barely fits in and is very hard to get ini tried several times to put it on and got frustrated this morning i got it oni may have to leave it on for a couple ofbr daysnever know when i will be able to get it on again i may look for a connector link and that should make it betterbr this could have just been a fluke but i dont honestly know if i will but from them again whic is sad because it is a nice piece,1
perfect size i have one handing on each door at home,2
great dress but if your hippy its gonna ride up in the back i loved it but my rear would be showing even though i went up a size,1
pockets everywhere except where you want them hand pockets somewhere up around your chest no interior security pocket but pockets all over the arms and in the back what conventional purpose does a left wrist pocket have zipper on the opposite side from where you expect it likely a british trait and mildly annoying speaking of britain it takes forever to get here and mailing back would likely cost as much as the product but good construction and heavy an item best not purchased online due to personal preference bite the bullet and up for patagonia or columbia at local outdoor store or really geek it up and go for north face,1
i really wanted to like these after reading all of the great reviews i was so excited to get thesebr have worn them twice and i wish i could return thembr for me they fit very strange good through the hips and thighs but the waist waistband creates the most unflattering muffin top it hits in a weird place and it seems like the waist band is the only part of the upper part that holds you in so its creates a bulging unattractive look i have to keep yanking them up to try to make the waist higher and its tight and uncomfortable i carry some weight in my middle but not so much that ive had issues with other jeansbr i wouldnt buy again,0
fits even the steam controller been great for testing project xcloud,2
this hat came smelling absolutely terrible almost like really bad fish food i have washed it four times and doused it with febreze i think we finally have the smell gone but as expected it did shrink a little bit with the washing it does fit my daughters head but she has a smaller than normal head and i dont think it would fit her if she didnt run on the smaller side i probably should have just returned it but she really loves the look of it i think itll work great now but buy another brand or you will find yourself throwing it in the laundry multiple times because of the smell i included a pic so you could see how it looks after multiple washes not quite crisp like a new hat but it will work,0
the pendant itself is only an inch long the details in each circle are neat just disappointed in the size just like everything else in life,2
it tends to roll up,2
dont buy this the clasp is only glued in place not stitched so the first time you put it on your wrist the clasp pulls out from the band making the watch band inoperable,0
not cute on very matronly smells funny sizing is true to us sizing though buy your regular size,0
perfect beautiful walking shoe can walk for hours in them they are soft and feminine so it is a good way to wear a dress with a walking shoe,2
the fabric isnt what i expected but it is a comfortable dress,1
nice material but way longer than expected it almost went to my ankles and im 52,0
fit nicely not too tight,2
i received an older generation kit and after reaching out to custom oaks vendor via email they sent me the correct one right away great customer service the kit quality is also great including the screws and screwdrivers to easy install it,2
im happy with these and the price is reasonable theyre soft and lightweight and are a nice fit for wearing under a sleep sack my son is 3 months 13 lbs 25 and these fit a little loose so he can wear them for a bit but not too loose so they dont keep him warm overall im satisfied,2
these have become my faves i run in them,2
it barely fit my 9yo daughter did its job,1
missing 6 of the 10 pieces of the upper circle for the netting,0
the bra is not comfortable not the best shape fit and fits small the material is not soft and it has sharp edges didnt work for me,0
the locks function and tsa were able to have access to my rifle without having me present for inspection if need be not that i want that other than that the only issue is that the locks themselves are tiny i have trump handshuge bigly hands and im over there struggling with these tiny little locks if you dnt mind that these locks just work for traveling with your firearm,1
its beautiful but the inside lining rips right out,1
love the material but both rings did not fit,2
its not what the pictures and description is completely different face masks,0
i just love these jeans ive bought these since my grandsons could fit into a 12 month size theyre adorable,2
the necklace gets tangled very easily,0
very nice quality,2
fell apart the 2nd day i wore it,0
love this dress my second purchase from this company the fit is perfect the fabric is flexible yet sturdy not seethrough wish it had pocket but you cant win them all,2
my teenage daughter bought this hat but it was too small it seems more sized for children the material was thin also she returned it,1
these are decent briefs ive worn the adidas climalite and climacool and the exofficio giveandgo and i think the champions are my least favorite of the bunch they arent bad and for some may be better in colder weather but the material is a little thicker and a little heavier and a little less soft than the others and the fit a little less forgiving in terms of snugness around the thighs still much better than cotton to be sure but id recommend one of the others instead of these,1
ive had a wenger classic field for about 8 years and the only issue has been with the date adjustment in the last year when the leather band wore out i replaced it with a stainless steel band and it looks great i love the black face and the luminous hand and numbers glow bright and clear the crystal has really resisted scratches despite wearing this for camping fishing and farm work as well as for going out,2
not soft the quality of hanes products have diminished considerably through the years the fit is fine the comfort is average,0
colors were off teal was more green burgundy was more redthose were the two colors i was buying the product for quite disappointed,1
good quality i bought it for my son my boy uses it very well,2
decent material but i ordered the set with one standard camo and one digital camo and this is what i got,1
for 12 you cant go wrong,2
way tooo small for a size medium stated for a womens size would better for a child to young teen,0
love this workout top so comfortable perfect fit and really cute to even wear as a regular top as soon as i got it in the mail and tried it on i ordered two more colors its amazing love it so much get one for yourself you wont regret it,2
not a bad buy for the price,2
the sneakers were too small and narrow in a 75 wide so i exchanged for an 8 ww and now they are too wide so i dont know what to tell you an 8 wide might work my normal size of 7 has gone up in the past year or so so i went with the 75 wide it seemed smaller than i would expect a 7 wide to be again i dont know make your best guess i like the sneakers if they would fit right i can wear them just need to wear thick socks my one foot has been swollen so it works for that,1
way too pink looking through them for my taste will try a different color,1
great fit a little sparkly which she lovedbr perfect for beginners gymnastics,2
cheap pixelated printing looks like a cheap chinese product not very durable or easy to clean,0
these are not compression shirts they are just under shirts,0
dont waste your money it showed up with a rip already in it pockets are either inconvenient or fake not the least bit warm lining in hood does not extend throughout body,0
with has hard as it is to find replacements to hold my misfit shine because i guess theyre just old tech now i was excited to find this band however it doesnt have the back that the original band had that prevents movement from popping it out of place thus i have almost lost it twice our dog found it so now its a little more scratched up than before and im sure ill eventually lose it jogging or playing tennis and my dog wont be there to find itbr br bummer it doesnt hold it better i think it will eventually lead to one more forced upgrade and i bought 2 so i would have a backup dumb,0
its pretty but completely dysfunctional it constantly slides and is much too long,0
these shoes are okay i dont think id buy them again if i had a choice theyre good for cycling but not for walking around it was probably my fault for not doing enough research before buying if this is the type of shoe youre looking for then they are high quality and have held up well,1
not thick at all,0
these are lovely but as other reviewers mentioned the posts are very long also there is nothing about them being stainless steel on the actual packaging if posts pressing into your skin is an irritation for you skip these,0
we had to return this item i wanted to like this but the arms were way too short and the overall sizing was off,1
very soft and cute color i got pink but the sleeves on the top is way too tight and the buttons keep popping open im a small for the most part esp with stretchy clothing items however there is little to no stretch in these pjs so i would size up 1 to ensure youll be comfortable im 49ish 120lbs 34c 26 waist 38 hips for reference length is not too long for me and im short so taller women should definitely size up for length as well,2
i ordered this for halloween and unfortunately it was too small for my head i had another male try it on and it was also too small for him as well quality shape and color were accurate and what was expected just too small for my use the kit includes a pack of various style stickon mustaches as well,1
cute shirt but runs a lot bigger than the size chart says will be returning,1
poor quality and two sizes smaller than normal,0
already had a pair so i knew what i was getting companies change styles often so got a extra pair while i could,2
dress was beautiful wouldve ordered a larger size but had a weird discoloring in the front so i had to send back didnt want to take a chance waiting for another one to come needed to start shopping for a dress for a wedding sooner,0
i usually wear an 85 or a 9 but the 9 was huge on me so if you go between two sizes go with the smaller onebr br the black leather flats were pretty comfy but this leopard one tore the back of my heal up in the two minutes i wore them around the house,1
chain broke immediately and because of how its made you cant attach your own chain so now its useless,0
durable and perfect for fall have worn them a few times and theyre stunning and havent fallen apart,2
i had originally bought these boots for hiking then i decide to wear them to work i work on concrete and go up and down ladders all day i wore them all day and had no problems yes my feet were tired but they didnt hurtbr they are very light weight and fit nicely on my heel and across the top they fit nicely even with a thicker sock,2
bought 2 of these and loved them so bought another 2 sizing is wildly unpredictable both of these are supposedly sized 0 to 3 months but the second set that i received are huge,1
didnt like the material,0
i am 6 ft 165 lbs 31 inch waist with a trim buildbr br consbr i found the crotch to be a little low and baggy on these i prefer my joggers to be slightly more form fitting but everyones shape is different so it may not be an issue for thicker built menbr there was some pink stains on the white stripe running down the leg i was able to get it off with stain removerbr br prosbr perfect length for 6ft they didnt shrink after an initial wash on warm and air drybr i appreciate the zippered pockets so that my keys stay secure as i am moving aroundbr not too thin not too thick i could wear them for a workout but prefer to just wear them for casual apparel,1
strap in comfortable but the sole is not thick enough to absorb running and long walks,1
love this top flattering and the fabric is so comfortable and breathable,2
this review is for the black mask the mask if pretty tight on an average adult head and the eyes are really high up the mask which necessitates pulling the mask down constantly so the eye holes dont end up on your forehead the mesh is also pretty dense and very difficult to see through i dont recommend this mask,1
these are nice a comfortable when i order these again i plan to get a smaller size and i think they will work much better i bought the bright blue pair very pretty,1
kinda heavy and length is short,1
bought a blk one i got xxl because chinese sizes always run two to three sizes smaller fits like a long shirt nothing like in pics,1
love the look of these dislike that the bail will not fit my 15 mm chains without the removal of the clasps very small bail inconvenient,1
classic shorts fit me perfectly as most of their models the fabric is thicker than i had expected but for the price this was a good deal,2
i love the vest but is off white,1
never fit me even close to correctly gave it to charity,0
bought these for a gift they loved them,2
my husband loves these shorts he lives in them and theyre stylish too many thanks,2
i dont love how the sesvenna half zip midlayer fits on me i wasnt sure of the sizing odlo is a swissbased brand so their size chart is centimeters converted to inches i have the shirt in size large and the chest measurement is approximately 40 inches thats actually closer to the xlarge on their size chartbr br the fit is supposed to be athletic aka slightly tailored its roomy in the chest and loose overallbr br the back of the shirt is slightly longer than the front which i like the half zip has a slim zipper stop the zipper pull is slim elastic cord with rubbery ends the ends pick up hair and dust which is unfortunate for a womens topbr br performancewise the shirt is a light layer midlayer is something of a misnomer i think as its made from lightweight fleece i used it outside when it was 50 and was comfortable but any colder outside and i wouldnt have been warm enough,1
buy cloth online 99 time have to return it this one exceed my expectation i have to write a review the material is soft and comfortable picture taken after i wear it for 2 hour private dance lessons you dont have to put back zipper all the way up you could just use a ribbon to tie at back of your neck like me i used safety pin to secured bottom of dress on my leggings so wont pull up when walking or dancingbr i like the price as well i will get another color,2
the necklace was broken but repairable and one earring was missing but still a lovely piece,1
i dont recommend these they are very very yellow in person which doesnt complement other gold jewelry,0
i was ultra snug but it felt just right kept me warm,2
good fi comfy,2
this came bent in a couple of areas where the belt had permanent wrinkles from ans knowing its 100 pu you can definitely smell it the hardware is very sturdy but also had some rough cuts ready for an injury ultimately im returning because its much too large i am 110lbs 5 and wear a size 0 jean and the small was for a 34medium34 this belt is fine if you can deal with the smell too,1
this are nice shoes keen makes a pretty durable show all around this fit true to size theyre pretty heavy in weight theyre well made and decently comfortable,2
great graphic tee for halloween colors look great shirt is very fitted just be aware for sizing,2
i got a 38d but the cups are a bit too big it cuts into the front of my arms just above the armpits so i should get a 38c in this case the bra feels soft and comfortable and supports well the first bra that i dont feel like i cant wait to rip it from my body when i get home from work,1
runs about 2 sizes too small and fabric is itchy otherwise its great,1
they turn green and they are very small i could not even screw the bottoms on the piercings,0
to start the belt at a distance looks fine but its not accurate at all for one all the pieces seem to be just glued to their respective plates and there was a lot of scratches chips and dents on mine its not great but if your just cosplaying or something its fine but not good as a display piece or as a replica,0
these are very tiny i expected them to be small but i was a little surprised by just how small they were that works fine for my purposes just keep in mind they are about the size of a womans thumbnail a short stubby nail,2
i think i have a normal size head but these hung off my face and are super large in size recommend if you have a large head or like big glasses wide across eyes,0
it was really hard to tell what this would be like in hand based on the one terrible picture provided in the listing it appeared to be a short scarf that had a hole in it to slip one end through to help it stay in place please keep in mind that sellers can update listings includechange photos at the time of this review at the time of ordering only one photo has been providedbr what arrived was a very long scarf in a very pretty very light pastel pink color while i like the color i dont like the look it looks much too much like the belt to my pink bathrobe granted this is much wider than my bathrobes belt but seriously aside from the width its darn near the same thing it is also rather bulky under my coat i dont know about you but i like to keep my scarfs under my outerwear to block the wind that enters through where i either button or zipper my various winter coats this absolutely keeps those drafts out but its so bulky that it puffs out the front of my coat so the air gets up under my coatbr i dont hate this scarf but if id actually had been able to hold it see it i wouldnt have purchased it,1
nothing at all like the pic,0
great product,2
we order these shirts for our family vacation we got 14 shirts in all for a baby to a grandpa everyone loved them and they fit nicely they also arrived very quickly,2
the dress is very pretty but completely see through i personally would not wear this without a slip of some sort however i cant imagine wearing a slip during the hot summer months so i returned it would buy in a heartbeat if the material was not see through,1
work on dummy but not a real person,1
not real sterling silver,0
was not expecting a piece of plastic with a chain the size a dog couldnt even wear,0
the chain turned brown instantly really poor quality,0
it is very thin more like a t shirt i hoped it would be thicker like a sweatshirt the green is pretty and ill keep it but still need a fluffy winter robe,1
great shirt vibrant colors i love it,2
great product has held up to my son taking it to school every day with his pe shoes in it and still looks brand new,2
it is a very pretty purse but the zipper is not all the way attached so it will not stay closed sometimes,0
the product was purchased for use as a purse however it was too large for me i did decide to use it for carrying my important paper and it is perfect for that i may try the smaller size to see if that will work i love that my papers are in one place neat and dry it is a mini file case,2
the sizes run larger then expected,1
it fits smaller than usual,0
reading the reviews i ordered a small because people said they ran big the top is fine but the bottoms are so tiny they would fit a 6 year old its ridiculous,0
i have ordered 3 of these the first was a medium and fit perfectly the second different pattern fits quite tight so the last one i ordered was a large and fits too big all are very comfortable and im wearing them allnot sure why the same pajamas in different patterns varies so much,1
ok product,2
fits about a 12 size too small i gave them away for the price i paid it wasnt worth the return i bought the sanuk brand which is much more expensive but a nicer quality and fit over all for the record the person i gave them too wears a size 75 and these fit her fine size 8 i wear a size 8 12 and usually an 8 in a sandal and these were a bit too small,1
it is not made for a strapless dress the way its made it dont really work well at all its flimsy,1
looks kinda cheap but my mom loved them so thats all that matters,1
i thought the earrings were larger they appear to be larger on line,1
this robe is perfect for mei get overheated very easy and this is thin enough that i dont get hot but yet thick enough to keep the chills at bay,2
very thin and too small,0
i was thinking this hoodie was an loose hoodie but its kinda tight around the waist area everything else bout the hoodie is cool even feels good but this hoodie is more like a shirt trying to be a hoodie,1
i spent a lot of time reviewing the product description looking for compression socks that did not contain latex i have a broken leg and had a severe latex reaction to ace bandages when this product was received there was no labeling showing latex freebr i cant recommend a product that might produce a severe skin reaction and where the manufacturer doesnt disclose the materials,0
bought as a gift and the fit was spot on and very soft,2
great,2
the inside was broken and tilted and so was the glass i sent it back very disappointed,0
was as expected but it came with a huge stain so i will be returning i am not even going to try it on,1
,2
it doesnt show in the picture but the dress is transparent and the inner layer is way too short could not wear it,0
very itchy and the crotch went down to my knees not going to buy this again it was so cute but i wish it would have fit definitely built for a boy,0
there decent leggings,1
very short waisted,0
it does not have a formed cup so all the weight of your breast hangs on your shoulders,0
goodthreads is quickly becoming one of my favorite brands honestly i feel like many of the sweaters are genderneutral and i actually ordered this one for myself this particular sweater is lightweight and very comfortable a mens medium is loose but not overly large for me 52 size 4 ive worn it casually with jeans as well as to work with a dress shirt underneath i havent had any issues with this sweater shrinking in the laundry i wash it on delicate and dry it on air fluff though,2
the soles are very comfy but something on the strap rubs so i cant walk for a long time in them,1
broke when took out of packing,0
returned them not comfortable,0
definitely run small i bought the mediums which said 78 since i wear a 7 i thought id be okay they fit but barely the top is tight and my toes almost touch the end id definitely go a size larger even if you are on the smaller end of the spectrum,1
i already have a lighter heated jacket that has an outer layer of fleece but with the snow and rain i wanted something that i could wear out in that and still be heated i ordered the xl size because i hover between large and xl one thing i like about this jacket is the fasters especially on the sleeves can shrink it up a bit for a great fit it comes with a 10000mah power bank that takes normal usb and usb c in and has the traditional usb plug out it charged fast enough and when i did my test of heating it worked great even on the high setting for the material i ran my arm under the faucet and the water just beaded right off this jacket will be great for the rainy and snowy months ahead,2
purchased for a baby shower gift great quality great price,2
wearing it right now i am 57 got the large i usually wear an 810 could be a tad longer overall looks really good my best advice is it runs a little smaller very comfortable and it has pockets,2
wife loves it the wrist 34bracelets34 are bit loose though,2
i love it easy to assemble and just right for my boutique,2
the sunglasses seem ok but i hate to see this happen the only reviewer with more than 1 review written stated that the sunglasses were sent to them buyer beware,0
feels cheap,1
nice fitting shirt always had good luck with this company fitting true to size and quality products,2
love the dress but strap broke as soon as i put it onluckily i can easily sew it to fix but shouldnt have to for a brand new dress im going to keep it because it is cute and comfy,1
it looks a lot better in these pictures than it actually is cover for watch screen is very flimsy and does not fit snug the band is very skinny for the 44mm screen very light and cheap feeling looks like it came out of a quarter machine,0
shirt was square not fitted or long enough the material was cheap and the lace was sown unevenbr print was nothing like the photo,0
very cloudy go into store in person i do not recommend buying these from amazon,0
i would have liked a smaller size butit will work,1
much smaller than expected,1
the bag is very useful and is pretty spacious inside to put necessities it has a back zippered pocket where keys can be safely kept also two front pockets enclosed with a snap closure which are pretty roomy to put small stuff its a very lightweight and sturdy bag,2
feet are always damp in the sweaty socks and water still gets in on wet trails i dont find them to be water proof,0
cute love it,2
great quality just fits a little big,2
very pretty ring looks great,2
i was medusa for halloween and this was a nice accessory it is cheap metal but it worked perfectly and i bet i wear again for short periods of time,2
i bought these shoes for the unique buckle with a hook for ease of use mine had a regular style buckle instead also the description said a non slip rubber sole nope its slick although is does have some grooves on the ball of the sole that being said the shoes are very sparkly and pretty with a decent fit,1
good for halloween costume,2
thin and bleeds even after vinegar rinse,1
nice boots,2
very comfortable washes well waistband does not roll well made i highly recommend and would purchase again,2
i loved it i just ordered two more shirts from this company,2
great shoesfast delivery son loves them would reorder,2
the shirt size fits as expected the only issue was the material it felt cheap and not well made i did send this back,0
i was not really pleased with the clasp the lug width is a tight 20mm and when attached to the watch it looks decent enough but its kinda cheap looking and feelingbr br also any attached band doesnt look as nifty as a band which is built for this type of deployment claspbr br overall it was a nice idea but its better to just buy a band built with this deployment already its a poor aftermarket substitute but it got the job done,1
my husband has not worn these to dance class yet but they fit perfect feel great,2
runs very small for someone short and petite picture speaks louder than words nice jumpsuits if it comes in your size,0
cheap looking in person,0
shirt is paper thin small and tight around the shoulders and sleeves shirt is very long and loose at the bottom looks like an illfitting night gown did not wash well wore it once and threw it away it would probably be ok for a very short person with small upper arms and small bust to wear as a dress with a slip since its see through,0
im going to cut to the chasebr i was angry livid and disappointed all in one when i opened the packagebr what i thought i ordered a pretty stylish blouse that could be paired with jeans or a skirt or dress slacksbr what i gotbr lace sleeves sewed onto a freakin long john shirtbr i cant believe that someone actually sent that product out br its waffle weave br aka long john materialso needless to say i cant wear it anywherebr pissed and i am glad that i didnt order both colorsbr wasted money,0
tag states xl but they sent me a small average quality wouldnt buy again,0
i bought six of these locks i would have rated them higher but 2 were defective and im returning them the other 4 locks were fine ive had these locks before and never had a problem with them so think it was just a fluke,1
before i even took it out of the package i knew it was going back its thin i expected it to be more like a sweatshirt and its like a nice tshirt with that said it seems to be a quality just not what i expected the color is good i ordered green but it does run a little small but i am a bit heavier i like the button and the hood but its not warm enough for me and too tight to wear additional layers it will have to be returned i think for a shirt the cost is a bit high,1
comfortable my feet dont sweat terribly with these and the thickness is perfect for any size of shoes they arent too thick or thin the stretchy fabric does not make my feet itch and breakout like some others stretch fabric,2
husband likes it but the buckle disengages from the belt part too easily,1
will order it again at some point,2
clingy material i ordered a size up and its skin tight returning,0
this bra is terrible it has way too much give fits like an old stretched out sports bra i ordered my size and deeply regret removing the tag before i put it on i can stretch the back clasp from my bra line down to my waist moves around and does not hold in place absolutely terrible the point is to hold everything in place i wouldve been better with just a regular bra,0
these which i bought said was a size 13 to 14 it could not have been any bigger than a size 10 there was no stretch to them at all i could barely get them halfway over my foot what a waste of moneydo not buy,0
great design correct fit great shirt,2
the quality is poor and the earrings are much larger than i expected,1
these were approximately one size smaller than the product states,1
this dress is beautiful it is well made and the design doesnt fold in on itself like a lot of similar ones do with the cut out parts it fits beautifully and every time i wear t i get a dozen compliments on it,2
they are pretty but sadly some of them came broken,0
it is very smal,0
this is a good quality sports bra that is relatively comfortable and durable but it runs small i ordered an s which i normally am and it is way too tight so recommend you order a size up,1
these are not well made they have multiple leather strands that just end and have a loosely wrapped tie holding them together which does not hold up well at all if you want to wear these for a couple of days at the beach or going somewhere but that is it i would guess these are ok but they will not hold together for any time longer than a week max,0
my husband is a heavy diesel mechanic when hes not working on his work stuff hes working on things in our garage i bought these to try out as all of his other rings are thicker and he complained about the comfort these are thinner than all of the other brands hes tried and he hardly notices that its even there and he absolutely loves the color changes we will be purchasing these in the future,2
i really like these they fit my face perfectly and are super cute i am thrilled with the quality for the price will definitly buy them again,2
very cute very popular with my coworkers who have told me they find him relatable especially during covid i work at a vet hospital so the pandemic has been a treat to work through this little piggy hangs from my book bag and apparently makes people laugh and feel better im sure some get offended by him which is fair but im surrounded by people with a dark sense of humor and he makes everyone around me smile,2
ordered 3 of these and returned all 3 every one had black marks like it was dragged against a tire,0
i never lose my earrings and i lost this pairone earring while swimming and one earring in the shower its got faulty posts the rubber backs it comes with are terrible i almost lost one while showering and so i changed it to a regular silver one i had and i ended up losing it so whatever posts i put on it the original ones it came with or the ones i already had didnt work total waste of money,0
large fits like a medium the fabric is not as thick as i thought it would be,1
this would have been so cute but it was too big and doesnt come in an extra small if youre not a size 4 or above dont order the small it wont fit,1
one of the clips consistently slips off i would like a replacement set,1
it is perfect fit well so very pretty,2
i love extra tuffs they are super comfortabledurable and look good and they last very long,2
this wallet is child sturdy and allows me to carry all my cards in one place and is small enough to fit in my pocket i especially love the vibrant dark green,2
im normally a size 7 in womens so i bought a 7 unfortunately the 7 was too big so i purchased a 65 fits perfectly,2
great shirt and fit true to size,2
nada ser pierde la piel,1
fits all my cards in a slim solution,2
supper cute,2
did not care for the color u ordered pink also these do not fit very well,1
they are adorable ty so much beautiful quality great price,2
fantastic coat very light and yet warm i found it tight across my chest and reaching forward was a struggle i tried a xl it should have fit,2
cheap price for cheap quality the metal is easily bendable and would break as easy as eggshells i would not recommend to buy,0
earrings are larger than expected and one of the earrings has a large hump of glue or sealant where the actual flower is attached to the post making the flower tip and not sit straightcentered,1
such a beautiful and nice feeling itembr i deducted 2 star for the mere fact as so many that claim us sizes wrongbr i ordered us xl which is impossible to fit into for a 61 male 200 lbsbr packaging was good average for chinese delivery timebr annoying smell despite sealed airtight plastic bag it smells like the blanket from an overseas containerbr pretty sure it would smell better after wash but i am heartbroken not to be able to wear this,1
excellent ballcapbr sharp and cool lookingbr this sailor think its a great gift for any navy vet or active great colors and logosbr one of my favorite covers or hatbr i bought 2 more for my navy brothersbr both thought it was awesome,2
the collar is weird not big enough for a tie and absolutely no collar roll,1
this top was disappointing as it is quite atight fit and very thin fabric it is very well priced but not a free size as expected,0
the shoe is cute but runs small,1
beautiful jacket however runs on the large size order one size smaller,1
the leggings material is comfy but the band is not and they come up super high,1
came apart after few weeks no response after sending message to spediel,0
great design but poor qualitythey did not look like sterling silver they looked like old tarnish metal and they are not worth 605 maybe,0
bought this as a christmas gift for my 50 year old son and he loves it,2
speck of white on an red area however overall nice look,1
very comfortable,2
the straps were sewn in backwards,0
description states 80 mohair however the tag on the actual garment states 20 mohair 80 acrylic more than likely i will be returning this item,0
love these shirts sized as expected soft and looks really good,2
i am so in love with this fitted cardigan the style is slimming with a soft shawl collar that travels down to a shiny pewter buckle to click you in or not cute open or closed the sleeves are on the narrow side so a fitted sleeved or sleeveless tee goes best underneath the color is that pure eggplant shade that is hard to find not grape and not royal purple a much subtler shade more sophisticated and neutral i think it looks great on every complection from ivory to deep chocolate and great on a range of body types too including fuller figures like mine once you get a glimpse of how this sweater smooths and flatters front to back youll be hooked i just cannot imagine anyone not keeping it that is how confident i am in this garment purchased late in the season so outside of the occasional chill of a late spring night itll have to wait in the closet for colder days and nights looking forward,2
potential to be a good shoe but the front cuts across my foot,1
this is a very cheap looking purse the lining and zipper closure did not lay right,0
clear solid lettering great for uniforms,2
i purchased these to match the kate spade watch was very excited until i wore them they are just too heavy on the ears had to return them,1
beautiful dress and style didnt fit my body well but i wished it had loved the material and design,2
cute dress thin material but comfortable completely see through youll def need something to go under definitely not good quality,1
they work perfectly with my studs and are a great replacement for the lost backs that originally came with the earrings,2
after just a few hours of wearing lost one of the black rings other then that product seems ok,1
i bought this product awhile ago probably beginning of 2018 and wore them for awhile and liked them however they got a hole in the butt so i ordered a new pair this new pair lasted a month before it got a hole in the crotch i was surprised they wore out so early but thought maybe i got a defective pair so i ordered another pair and they also got a hole in the crotch within 3 weeks dont waste your money on cheap clothes spend more money and buy higher quality leggings that will last you much longer,0
the socks are comfy but they are dog hair magnets the sock in the picture just came out of the washerdryer i have to take a lint roller to them every time i do laundry to get about 60 of the dog hair out the other 40 is logged into the fibers of the socks maybe thats the price you pay for having a pet but this certainly doesnt happen to our other socks so go figure,1
amazing,2
these shoes are sooo cute but unfortunately they run a full size too small sadly i had to send them back,1
i have ordered many pairs of sunglasses from amazon as i live in fl and you can never be without a pair these happen to have the reader magnification on the outside of the lenses which means it is very visible to anyone looking at you that you have readers on i didnt really think it was a big deal until i started seeing them in pictures that were being taken i personally would not purchase these again because of that reason,1
wear them wash them saves on the jeans around the house,2
these are super i get so many compliments they are different colors depending on how the light catches the earring and depending on which angle you see it from i love the little dogs on them too the post is sterling silver,2
very good,2
not a bad water shoe for the low price perfect if youre only going to use them a couple times a year the bottoms started peeling off the second summer i used them,1
i bought these aug 2018 and im still wearing them a year later in sept 2019 i mostly wear them to the office but theyve done 10ish beach trips and 20 sits in the 185 degree sauna i got these in navy and based on other reviews it looks like theyve held up better than some other colors im ordering a new pair now because these just started looking shabby the foot bed is super comfortable for me i hope they keep making these forever i might just have to buy multiple pairs,2
the best thing to buy for pennsylvania weather my wife is very happy with the fit and comfort of this hoody,2
the directions werent good at all could not figure out how to set the time let alone one alarm,0
cute but broke after 2 weeks,1
the collar is very cute although very high on the chest nearly to my neck i recommend wearing this with high necked sweaters and dresses unfortunately i only have mid chest length tops very comfortable though would look very cute with high neckline shirts,1
this dress material is terrible on top of that i bought it 3 sizes bigger than what i am and it still didnt fit well it runs short and the dress isnt anything like what it looks like in the picture it falls flat on your body and doesnt expand with your curves,0
very nice black leather compact mens wallet the outside of this wallet is very nice 100 leather appears to be well stitched inside and out 34filgate34 is stamped into the leather on the front open the wallet you will find 4 credit card holders this may be the open downfall of this wallet i usually have 2 or 3 credit cards my dl a wholesale card and medical card in my wallet thats 6 cards in 4 slots might work there are 2 additional 34hidden34 areas under the credit card slots the bill slot is rather deep at about 434 deep the wallet measures 42534 tall by 375 wide when it is bifolded opened the wallet is 7 wide this would make a very nice wallet for me or as a gift,2
the material its made of,1
i bought these for a halloween party and they just didnt impress me they look amazing once out of the box but after one night of wear they have some film peeling off of them as if they were made really cheaply for paying as much as i did over 100 at the time i was not very happy,0
i got these in a 3x because the reviews seemed iffy on how true to size they would be i usually wear a short inseam size 2022 the material feels really thin not like itll rip easily thin but its not a thick or high quality fabric think like fake jean material not jegging i dont think its breathable either so if youre in a hot environment or sweat this may be a bit stinky by end of day i tried them on and immediately knew i needed to return im 5 feet 2 inches and the pants not only went up to my midsection but they were awkwardly loose and going past my heel cuffing wont work since the print is only on the outside i think going down a size to my true size would help some aspects but then i fear it would still be too long and would fit too snug to hide the fact im wearing pants so high up so im going to probably pass on these,1
impossible to get the end to screw in i tried for so long that my hand cramped up and my husband tried forever as well if the screw was a bit longer it would be immensely helpful,0
this is a gift for a baby due in july i ordered 3 months and its so small i doubt the baby will be able to wear it more than twice this summer the design is super cute though,1
great hat and great quality,2
this dress is an epic failthe flowers on the train are sticky for some reason so when unfolding this dress for the first time the pink flowers started peeling and not to mention that all the other flowers on the top part of this dress are put on this dress with a hot glue gun so the majority of them came off before my daughter even attended her princess party waste of moneydo not buy this dress,0
wife loves it and is perfect fit she bought a small,2
in general good quality and fabric is a bit stretchy too but the waist is very very tight id recommend ordering a size up for the size i bought i already did order a size up myself the waist should have been much wider and more comfortable also top part of dress is tight and hard to fit the blouse in so if you are very busty order 2 sizes up,1
love it,2
the fabric is way too stretchy for larger women i wanted to use it for a post mastectomy breast form but yikes they ended up horribly uneven,0
trash metal not stainless,0
not what i want when im camping in subzero weather but i dont need high tech high dollar long johns for every day around town use these are cheap and durable and just enough of a layer to help when the temps get down to around freezing,2
the design and color of the shirt are beautiful but this runs waaaaaaay too small i was looking for that loose flowy fit as show in the photo not what i got i normally wear an xl so i ordered an xxxl and it was still tight on me if you want a tighter fitting shirt then its great but if you want a flowy fit order about 4 sizes up,1
although theyre thicker than what i expected i used them a few days ago for the first time and they performed well living in fl i will probably get some lighter ones as well but overall satisfied with the gloves especially for the price,1
the material is cheap but it fits and is kinda cute not exactly what i expected but ill wear it,1
my hippie sister loved it,2
good basic nice weight well made t shirt,2
meh they are ok but not great kind of wish i had waited a little longer to take tags off could have gone down a size but i dont think that would solve the biggest issue i have with these the rise is super high they sit well above my navel and because they are not snug fitting there is a little strange foldingpooch at the crotch ill be altering the leg width as i do with many pants just cant seem to win finding a good fitting jean anymore these are pretty much mom jeans,1
the insoles tend to move around easily which means you have to readjust every time you put the shoes on this gets really annoying really fast,1
so far ive only worn this dress once not sure why this dress is not flattering on me it looks boxy,1
i replaced the band on my vivoactive with this band and am quite pleased i have small wrists but it is still very comfortable even tho it is heavier than the plastic band i replaced the only down side is that my roadid plate doesnt fit on it due to the thickness other than that i like it a lot the tools included were quite handy as well,2
comfortable easy wearing many compliments,2
it broke my nose out,0
theyre definitely oversize as the product name warns but really nice especially considering the price they look way more expensive than they are i receive compliments every time i wear them,2
if it says expected but it shrinks really easily do not put in dryer,1
ordered two of these in 3xl tall one fits perfectly one is strangely way too tight even though both say 3xl tall on the outside packaging the label on the inside of the shirt that fits too tight says xl tall im sure that after washing it it will be delegated to the rag pile or given away im giving it three stars because the one shirt fits fine and seems of decent quality but twenty two bucks for one thermal underwear shirt and a rag seems a little pricey lol,1
received today wore it fell to sleep it stopped,0
super cute last s really long time ive received many compliments when i wear these but they definitely run smallbr i give them 3 stars because ive rolled my ankle several times in these,1
i have ordered this cute top multiple times trying to find one that fits up size or down did not work,0
i have been using these socks by adidas for years when my current socks were worn out i clicked the previous order and reordered 12 pair to my surprise when i put the socks on the first thing i noticed was that i could see my foot through them they are not the comfortable cotton socks they used to be looking at the description online i now realize they are now made of polyester no cotton at all im so disappointed theyre going back right away,0
in addition to being very small a number of the socks were inconsistent sizes i have a couple large pairs which actually fit better than the other 8 pairs and one mismatched pair that is useless,1
i wear jeans w size 33 but this belt did not fit me even after i put it to the maximum length it might fit size 30 but for sure wont fit size 32 neither,0
very comfortable the gray black color scheme goes with my wardrobe,2
i didnt buy this shirt because the area code is 707 not 415,0
nice hat embroidery is professionally done,2
nice bracelet but size is for a man this will fit very few women it was returned,0
i love a very good quality thank you,2
dislike these shortsbr they pretty see thrubr barely made out of anything,1
these pencils do not sharpen they crack and fall apart i was very excited for them but am now disappointed i still use them but only until it needs to be sharpened you probably dont want to waste your money,0
they felt good at first but they are just too big if you like a baggy fit in the butt and thighs you might like these i dont like that feel or look unfortunately i forgot to return them in time,0
i bought a large because i regularly wear medium but in this case i bought a large and it was way too small on me for beiung a size large and the material is so thin and cheap now i have to return it im disappointed,0
1,2
i kept the silver because the front strap was full enough for my bunion but now i bought the same sandal in gold and its cut narrower on the front strap strange,2
i like the materialeasy to breathe even though layers it covers the whole of an adults face filters ok too so far sturdy with good stitchingbr not so great is the thickness of the earloops they can be uncomfortable also there is no nose clip,1
the quality not very good expected moreits very light weight,1
ill never buy from them again worst watch ever,0
these are way too big the sizing chart was obviously no help for me,1
cute shoes fun colors but only wore them about 5 times and they already started coming apart near the heel the foot bed is coming off of the corkbr br would not recommend for the price,0
when i pulled off the cap to open the bottle the sponges came off with it and about half the bottle spilled all over my floor what a mess needless to say i couldnt use it,0
i was looking for platform shoes for work and ran across these these shoes are adorable so far they are comfortable although it lacks in arch support just a tad i still enjoy them they are stylish and a solution to my problem of my scrubs dragging on the ground,2
fit great and look great,2
this is cute for a quick out fit it does not make you skin turn colors,2
its missing a band at the top of the waistband making it heady to roll down the price is great for what you get but it makes a difference if leggings are all you really wear,1
was what i needed for the amusement water park great quality moveable stretchable comfortable,2
this is perfect for everyday carry,2
very comfortable,2
good,1
i am 56 and weigh 152 lbs and pretty busty if i were to order this item i would order it in an extra large it shrinks a little and its not very big on top material is comfy,1
didnt fit it was too big,2
the earrings are very pretty but are made of soft malleable wire i had to reshape one of them and fix the clasp,1
disappointing dress fabric was a nice weight but theres where any positive feedback ends picture suggests that floral bottom is part of fabric but it was another piece of fabric sewn on looked like a big black trash bag,0
this dress is beautiful classy and elegant the deep purple color is so awesome i work in a law office and this is one of my favorite dresses for work paired up with a good pair of heels this dress makes me feel like really good i highly recommend it i also recommend going a size up from what you normally wear i typically wear a medium but i ordered a large after reading other reviews and from previous experience with this brand of dress and its great i also bought a shortsleeve verson see photos and i love it again buy one size up you wont regret it these dresses fit like a glove look classy and are comfortable,2
when i first got these socks i thought i got ripped off they where stiff did not seem to stretch and were tagged for light hiking well i took them backpacking in the rockies and wore them for 5 straight days of hiking and aired them out at night i never needed to change them out these socks actually surprised me with their comfort ability to stay dry fit and fresh smell too i am glad i did not return them as these are now my goto socks for backpacking if i did not try them i would have never thought they were this great i strongly recommend them but just make sure you get the right size,2
a small wrist man as myself finds it a tad large in the latter past month it started readjusting itself and i would have to pull the strings to get it backbr i prefer the adjustment to work for a size 7 7 34 betterbr it only lasted 4 months before it brokebr for the cost in consequential,0
this is my 2nd pair of merrils very tough and they last best thing about them is the sole they last a very long time,2
too tight on the calfs but that could be my calfs feet feel great,1
well made but a little heavy and large for me,2
lenses are plastic which doesnt provide a crisp view,0
tunnels looked cut up and beat up my son also developed an ear lobe rash this product is not worth the money,0
fit tts holds up well in water dries quickly comfy to wear,2
i have many new balance sneakers i usually buy a 7d as they are comfortable and roomy i purchased a 75d thinking they would be comfy a little bigger my toes hit the end are more narrow then my others i am disappointed because they are well made and love the color,1
really cute but a little too big especially in the arms also there is no lining in the chest which i dont feel comfortable with it did look super cute on other than that,1
i like wearing oversized tshirts so i order xxl even though xl is more my sizebr the xxl size is tiny my wife wears s or m usually and if barely fits herbr even if the size was good the design is blurry,0
not the intensity of red color i was expecting,1
ive always worn a big kid size 6 and these were too big too wide very comfortable but had to send back,1
fits 2 sizes smaller than the tag reads disappointed,0
this dress is very voluminous it bubbles out much more than it appears from the photo and the way the pleats are attached to the top make it very puffy it looks better with a ribbon tied below the bust to make it an empire waist i would think youd always want something on under it as it billows out enough to see everything i intended to use this as a maternity dress but even in my third trimester it overwhelms my figure i give it three stars because i do think some people would like wearing it with a ribbon and leggings,1
these glasses are soooo small for my facethey are smaller than regular shadesi wouldnt recommend anyone to buy this junk a waste of money,0
this was not what i thought material is good but zi wanted more closing on top either drawstring or zipper i feel its not safe when you put items in someone could be behind me taking items out without me knowing it,1
good style but too heavy and long skirt to me,1
fits small after the first wash is even smaller if you buy this buy it 2 sizes bigger,0
i really like this stackable very pretty,2
great for small kids ie those 56 and under the designs were cute but they did not for my 8 year olds,1
bought this for a trip to ny in the winter and it was perfect i didnt have to carry my purse as there are so many pockets that i could put everything i needed in them and be purse free i ordered this in black because the green was sold out at the time and it worked out well i was worried about the sizing but went with a medium and it was the right choice i am 5634 and 136 lbs the side pockets were great for when i had to sit down or wanted a looser fit the lining in the hood is so soft and cozy i wore this in the snow and i never got wet and definitely stayed warm i most likely will be getting the green one too,2
gave as a gift washes up fine dad loves em,2
a very beautiful ring,2
black peeled right off the nose hoops and looked horrible do not buy these,0
this dress is cute and simple for just relaxing or going to a friends house they run super small i bought it a 3x and im an xl and it was just the right fit but if you want it tight i suggest you get just one size up,2
this is a really nice hat for hot summer weather the mesh panels allow air to flow over sweaty hairhead and keep you cool the hat did have a smell pretty reminiscent of clothing dye and definitely holds onto the sweat odor but is easy to wash and dries super quicklybr br i did notice a few loose threads and seams that werent absolutely perfect however for the price i would definitely recommend to a friend,2
just buy it you wont regret it i bought this as a gift for my mom but my son has been taking it so its pretty much his at this point very plush and comfortable i bought the 3x size and it touches the floor on him his height is 58 and 199 lbs,2
a bold and wonderfully strong ring design that speaks of strength and charm i love this,2
it was tight in the chest 36d i wanted to love it but it just didnt work i kept it but probably wont wear i think i got size medium and large would have been too low cut i also didnt like that you had to tuck it in as i like to leave my tops untucked,1
ive ordered 3 pairs at different times the first pair was excellent and did not have a logo written on one of the lenses the second needed some manipulation to fit properly and did have a logo on the lens the third pair did not fit well at with minor manipulation one of the earpieces broke at some point an earpiece from the second order will likely fix it it also has a logo on the lense i will not order another pair as i find the logo in the corner of the lens distracting,1
the sandals were very lightweight which was great the top straps of the sandals were elastic bands that stretched to fit your foot i found the elastic bands tight and left indentation on the top of my feet i have a small bunion on my right foot the stretch bands covered the bunion and caused pain i have had other sandals such as sketchers with stretch bands that were comfortable on top of my feet the sole on the sandals was very soft and comfortable as a reference i am 55 tall and weigh 165 lbs i returned the sandals,1
looks great online looks horrible in person shirt came dirty as well not pleased with this purchase sending it back,0
the only similarity of what i ordered and what i received was that both were dresses black and at least claimed to be tommy hilfiger brands besides that it looked nothing like the picture provided suspected that it was a knockoff dress that had a tommy hilfiger tag added to it,0
from the image i knew it was a higher slit but the slit of this dress is so high it shows everything i have a small chest and small waist with a larger butt and it fit perfectly on top but i was completely exposed on the bottom portion the material is super thin borderline sheer where it is only single lined with a little more fabric on the skirt portion i think this could be a great dress,0
horrible quality super angry i spent an money on this,0
i liked these and think they could serve their purpose nicely however on my neck i found they come undone easily off one collar or the other found it hard to keep it in place without making my collar feel too snug,1
im plus size with lumps and bumps this is not for a women will curves that dont want to be super noticeable i wish it came in a larger size runs small,1
i read all the reviews and when i got these i thought they were better than the reviews however after wearing them a couple of times i noticed that the waist has less stretch but the rest of thenshorts didnt hold their shape as well as i expected they quickly got a little stretched out in the leg they can still be worn but they are not my preferred shorts,1
i loved this boots so confortable unfortunately i wear them only about 15 to 20 times since i got them a year ago and they are good for garbage now both shoes split in same place,0
it did not fit plus was thin false advertising do not buy i order 3x dang how big of a size do you have to order gave to my daughter in law fit her perfect even though she wear a junior size,0
its ok,1
not the most comfortable but nice,1
the hearts are kind of wide and out of shape not my favorite heart sunglasses,1
super pretty i washed in the washer and the elastic twisted up,1
wouldnt recommend no support and very wide,0
did not like how the elastic in the waistband turns and bunches up,1
not gel not only were these very poor quality too big low stretch they are foam not gel,0
they fit prefect very comfortable and they keep my hands warm i can play on my phone with no problems great buy,2
while i love the product i decided it was a bit too large for my needs sometimes its hard to visualize the actual dimensions however when i went to return the bag the seller wanted me to pay a 20 restocking fee which i did not know about previously and which i consider exorbitant so no im not happy,0
purchased s 5 334 tall 130 lbs 32b bra i didnt love it so am returning fit was good though it wasnt as flattering or 34drapey34 as i hoped seemed like it just kind of hung shapelessly in the front not a pretty drape but more like a sack and yet the back feltlooked a little snug around the shoulders like it was pulling around my shoulders a bit i definitely dont think i have wide shoulders for my size the main thing was that the shirt just looked sort of tacky cheap to me and the floral print on the front was a bit boldlooking for my petite size i was looking for a dressier option than a tshirt and felt this wasnt much of an improvement over a tshirt after all,1
look i adore this sweater the size and style are perfect but the first time i wore it it shed little pills all over me i washed it thinking that would help nope its not annoying enough for me to stop wearing it but i do have to make sure i only wear it with other garments which are lighter colors so that i dont look like i own a sheep that sheds its significantly bad,2
definitely love my socks,2
much smaller than they look i was expecting something longer too small for what i was looking for,0
they are awesome sunglasses theyre just alot bigger than i thought theyd be lol,1
the toe strap as others have written is i for table between ones big toe and second toe fine for gym use but wouldnt want to walk a mile in them,1
not skinny,1
my son loves his hat so much great buy,2
very thin and see through almost like panty hose but i bought for her to wear under her dresses,1
very pretty but i had to send back my daughter is 5234 the space between the top of the dress and her shoulder was just to short if they did not have the beadingchains off the shoulders just a single strap to the back they would have been fine otherwise need to have a longer torso,1
it is difficult to find socks that last more than one year these socks have added arch support so the arch does not wear out that quickly it also provides more cushioning these are the most durable sock you will find with this cotton content,2
shorts fit well but ive worn them twice now and the one cap fell off of the drawstring,1
this showed up broken,0
gave to my son for christmas size is as advertised he really likes these shirts they seem heavy to me but he likes them because he can wear them during really hot days,2
my grand thinks these are amazing and deemed them best shoe ever,2
returned this was just too synthetic for my preference went with an all wool alternative,1
i got compliments on them right after i put them in so cute and exactly what i thought they would be,2
i ordered 3 of these floaty casual waterfall cardigans the fit was as expected but the material on the wine color and the rose color was completely different from the khaki color the khaki color was a soft flowy jersey type of material the wine and rose colors were a heavier totally different type of fabric both are nice but not what was expected as they all fit fine order two sizes up i gave 3 stars for the unexpected surprise i dont think i will order from this company again i dont know what i would get certainly from this order i didnt get what was expected and the return is far to expensive to bad the companys not able to honestly describe their products,1
i put them on and the glasses did not hug around my face maybe they are designed for men with big heads i am returning them i bought the cheaper version of these glasses and those cheaper ones fit great,1
i picked these pants up for my teenage daughter and we both like them a lot the fabric is on the thinner side when compared to traditional sweatpants but my daughter says they are still warm and cozy the inside of the fabric is incredibly soft too so that is nice i wouldnt call the fabric too thin either i cant see her underwear lines through thembr these also seem to be true to size they look great on her and fit her perfectly and the natural fabric drawstring detail is just too cute these were an excellent find,2
worn these before and sold them in retail stores i am glad they are in wide,2
my husband loves it,2
bought this for my husband he wears size 13 shoe and has muscular calves this is made very small im an a average size woman and they are even snug on me would only fit really thin guy with small feet,0
its a very pretty print but i wish colors were a bit more vibrant for the price im paying but its ok,1
i can not review this item it was given as a gift,1
lovely lovely dress but i had ordered an xxl and received an xl which the bust was too small on it and i could not fully zip up the dressbr br i am planing on returning the item and get a xxl,1
the necklace is pretty but the hook that hold it in place turned black in 2 days while the necklace is still gold also the necklace pictured is not the one i received still a nice piece i think i might buy a leather necklace to go with it instead,1
maybe i didnt read the description closely enough but we needed mittens for a specific reason snd these have individual finger dividers inside,0
quality was ok but if youre curvy you will have a huge gap a the waist i ordered 10 petite and they fit everywhere but the waist and length im 54 and these were way too long,1
im only giving this 3 stars and may change it after using this however it seems extremely cheaply made nylon zippers that already split open upon unzipping for the first time ive purchased other brands with a better quality all around that have much better zippers,1
initially ordered it with the intention of wearing to worknope too casual but super comfy and cute its perfect for fall weather and perfect to put over a fitting shirt and cover those extra belly fat that you want to hide the material is light but not thin not recommended for cold weather,2
i bought for my girls they loved it its beautiful and comes with earrings,2
not as big as picture makes it look,0
excellent quality fast shipping,2
perfect pin for my oktoberfest hat,2
cheap quality,1
i loved it on the web but it was not for me it fit differently and not right,1
exactly what i was looking for,2
tottaly different color in real life compared to the pic onlineand extremely largely fitted,0
da bears,2
the bottom fall done in the first wash,1
this item was very cute for my newborns first thanksgiving but the decal started peeling off before the end of the day it was also very big for him ive put it away in hope he can use it next year overall it was poor quality but you get what you put into it i guess,0
thinnest fabric ive ever seen in a tank top keeping because i really need a white tank now would not buy again,1
they run small and are always too short in the crotch legs too long,0
these fit perfect really thought they be too small and or tight but i love them the only problem i had was there wasnt a hole for the button so had to make one but that was just a small fix nothing to get mad about,2
not cheap flimsy feeling sturdy,2
im not really doing this dress justice i chose the wrong size so theres too much fabric around the waist the fabric is lightweight and has no stretch theres a lining for opacity the sleeves are the best part of the dress it works well for video calls where youll only be seen from the waist up theres a hook closure at the split neckline you can choose to wear it open or closed you can choose your normal size for fit reference im 56 153lbs and a 34g bra size my normal size 10 would have been idealbr br thanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier,2
a small is huge should have xtra small option not enough time to return since it was a gift i bought in january for february birthday,0
the xl was for a long torso,2
this item is extremely small i wear a large so i ordered a xxl it is way too small if you wear a small make sure you order an xl,0
love how it feels and the quality of the product looks great on my llv keys,2
i had to return this item it fit good from the top area the bottom was just way too loose,0
this hoodie definitely keeps me warm ive had it for over 2 years but ive only worn it a few times it holds up well in the washer but i do wash it on the hand wash cycle on cold i dried it the 1st time regretted it it definitely shrunk i purchased several other hoodies just like this that never shrink i would wear it more but its not my favorite because falls short at my waist wasnt that way when i initially tried it on the hood itself didnt cover my head from the beginning im 56 160lbs got a large all my other hoodies like this are large fit nothing like this the one thing i dont like is the length of the sleeves i dont have long arms but the sleeves end short at my wrist id say from my personal experience size up definitely dont dry it hang it to dry its a bummer because it is so warm this season as i bring out my winter clothing it will be time for me to probably donate this one to the goodwill i own several others i wear this one takes up space i would have returned way back when i purchased this but i had already washed it threw out the bag it was in my 2 star reflects the warm the nice color pattern otherwise i wasnt happy with this purchase i would have never thought to order an extra large most of my weight is below my waist i personally dont recommend,0
they were not as cute as they picture they had a bad fit to them which is why i did not keep them,0
i love these boots i have tried several pairs of boots and sent several back i love these boots as they are roomy enough very study but also feel very light i love the color as well i would definitely recommend these boots we hike almost everyday so they are getting lots of use and i had no breaking in period i wear a size 11 womens,2
liked the sturdy construction and good fit,2
it might have only cost 01 cent but the shipping charges are 7 it was so not worth it as it looks and has the appearance of plastic it is cheap made and wont last long stay away from this one,0
these pants are simply just not good id pay maybe 5br they look like they would fit and feel great but its quite the oppositebr cheap feel and rough liningbr br do not recommend,0
ordered as gift for boyfriends birthday and he really liked this shirt glad i read the reviews before i bought it because he can wear either an xl or xxl and i ordered the xl based on other reviews and it fit him great will order more when the price drops again,2
i wear a 3x in womens and went 2 sizes up as suggested because of reviews when i received it today to try it on i noticed that it was inside out like someone had tried it on and didnt think much of it until i saw this nasty stain they sent me something that was used and tried to pass it off as new expecting me to pay for their problem anyway i went ahead and tried it on to see if it would even fit in the first place and it was way too small and i even checked the measurements before i received the item it is misrepresented in size by a long shot my husband is even way smaller than i am and he could not even put his arms in the sleeves i have 2x shirts that i can fit my arms in and this outfit would not even fit i am disappointed and tired of these chinese products and they should have american standards never again,0
i ordered a medium size adult it barely fit my 10 year old other then that quality of the material and design was good,1
pretty good nose rings a few are a lil crooked but overall nice not too long not too short the picture makes it look like there are more than there is when you open package there arent any rings behind the front label,2
i ordered the medium and it was super fitted but still looked nice my huge problem is the print i bought the shirt got it in yesterday and the letters are already peeling offbr br super unhappy because for almost 18 i couldve bought letters from walmart which is what the letters look like and made the same shirt the saying is cute the material is nice but im terrified that once i wash it that ill be left with half my letters and pissed,0
nice discrete lego design on the face its an attractive watch the band is really easy to adjust to any size,2
smelled awful very see throughbr too clingy and wrinklesbr wouldnt recommend returned,0
a bit small for my noggin,0
wrong sizes package said 12 but actual item couldnt have been more than 14 impossible to use as it is way too small,0
ordered a 27 waste for my girlfriend who always gets the same size we needed a 28 or 29 inch waste to fit her but the product is still since christmas out of stock in those sizes so we had to settle for a refund not sure the delay in their manufacturing and we couldnt get a hold of tge company as to when the larger sizes would be available runs very tight order atleast 1 2 sizes larger buyer beware i wished we could have gotten the right size as they are nice looking jeans and i wish someone would reach out and say when the 28 waste would be available that would be nice bad customer service,0
yikes when i bought this product i thought the earring were ceramic or something like that but they are actually silver with a white paint coating that started chipping by the third day by day five it was so bad i actually had to stop wearing them,0
i love the color and great length of the earrings l,2
i like t6he fact that its a cotton stretched which the additional 34flexibility34 to the product but its weird i am not used to having 34free34 ends it feels like it goes up all the time it does not really bother me though it just doesnt have a time for it,2
the pants are well made with lots of pockets which is what i wanted but the pants were too big for the usual size i wear so i had to return them also they had a button and button hole inside by the zipper i dont know why,1
i did not like this fabric it felt like plasticky cotton and had an odd shinebr br one of the least nice items ive received from yesno,0
i have worn these bras for years but the quality of these i ordered was beyond junk the fabric was thin warped uneven seams and stitching my god compared to my 3 year old bra same company same bra i was more than disappointed what is the problem here a knock off has to be,0
fabric and color is nice but the uniform runs a size small,1
was about 23 sizes too small for me i couldnt even get my arms in because of my shoulder width it warns you that they run small but they dont even have a size that would fit me the quality seemed fine but it certainly was not designed for a 6 235lbs firefighter if you wear a medium a large or xl would fit you fine anything bigger and you might have some trouble,1
very nice fits my 8yo as expected,2
the post that goes through the ear are weak and super easy to bend i returned them and they a junk piece of jewelry,0
pretty but too wide really i feel like they stretched out after a couple of wears,1
a bit of a boxy cut material is nice,2
my husband loves them,2
im a 2xl bought a 3xl couldnt even get into it was super tiny while advertised as a winter hoodie it is very thin it is a light pullover at best,0
3x too small for 48b with one postop shoulder and other arm awaiting repair of cuff repairs was too sore for pulling up probably would have needed 5x or 6x if even made in that size appears well made will pass it along to someone who can use it,0
i ordered these based on size of an old pair of keds always love having new pair of white keds these were too small for me and rubbed blisters on my heels will order half size bigger next time,1
its ok a little heavy and tons of strapsdoes hold a lot,1
putting on this shirt left me speechless doesnt hang like the photo at all i cant even begin to describe how unflattering this was and in such a strange way i cannot recommend it 2stars instead of 1 because the material wasnt horrendous,0
i was very disappointed as the color is not what is picturedit is a more muted pale pink,0
looks great it did get slightly bent on the rims when it arrived otherwise i would have left 5 stars,2
the necklace is fragile i ordered 3 set and 1 came damaged,1
hole in it first day,0
perfect fit true to size cute addition to summer skirt hole falls a little short on leg by the pocket other than that good,2
at first i started off saying i like the dress but it arrived with little holes in the back of it,0
fit like garbage some fingers too tight some too long i greased a pair up to see if theyd softenthey did not i guess i have 2 pairs of i do t care if i lose them gloves,0
perfect i am an adult female size 6 and these wings fit the straps are a little snug and the wings do not stand out above my shoulders they are perfect for my butterfly costume to disneyland however if youre a large adult andor want big and bold wings these are not for you,2
i wear a 12 or l in womens sizes i am 5 5 and have 42 30 41 measurementsbr br i purchased the xl in this dress and it was very disappointing the material was thick but the patterning seemed to be cut as a tube versus a fitted dress so it stretched in the bust and hips white riding up and wrinkling in the mid section it was short on me and came 4 off the floorbr br returned after trying on,1
this looks reasonably nice but is made with the cheapest polyester plastic blend that i have ever felt i cant imagine it lasting more than a couple wears but functioned well as a cover up,1
used for workbr product has changed have had to replace 3 times in a year,0
when i first tried these on i didnt think they were going to fit but they work very well they stretch to fit your foot i like these but boy are they slippery inside the shoe super comfortable stay in place the heel doesnt slip in every shoe ive worn them in so far but while walking your foot slips around inside the shoe due to the material being silkyish i like them but wish they were more grippy somehow,1
was looking for a dress with this type of pattern as part of my halloween costume other options i saw were about twice the price so this was great fit was good for me im usually wearing a medium or just bordering on large material is stretchy so it has some give i did get a lot of compliments when i wore it already started seeing a loose thread or two after a couple washes so i wouldnt expect this to be overly sturdy or long lasting but decent for what it is and the price i had 2 options to order direct from china or 1 option to order with amazon fulfillment needed it faster so i payed the extra dollar for amazon fulfillment and had it in less than a week satisfied with my purchase,2
lightweight and completed my mardi gras outfit i even tripped and fell and it stayed on my face i like the tie string that comes on it its so much better than elastic elastic usually hurts my head,2
when wearing the garment an visiting the ladies room it is difficult to unlatch and latch the hooks they are like bra hooks it would be better if the hooks were easier to reach however the garment is quite comfortable and easy to slip into with good tummy control,1
poor quality of linen very rough not worth buying,0
too hard material,0
didnt really shape anything absolutely no way to use it as shapewear theres no opening or clasp on the bottom so in order to use the bathroom be prepared to have to take your whole outfit off first,0
its not truly black it is a grayish black that does not match any black colored nike apparel by the time i wore this cap for the first time it was too late to return it i very much dislike hate this cap its the worse everyday item i really wanted to wear a lot,0
terrible terrible couldnt get it off after it was snapped on struggled for 15 minutes with different ways to undo the buckle finally had to cut the belt in half money wasted what a trauma,0
not really a medium more like a small,0
they are very long if you are under 5ft 5 inches they are way to long for you,1
it is okay it is shorter than the other taxi wallets i have doesnt hold cards as well,1
i liked the quality how ever it had some small lint on it and it made my nose itch so that was uncomfortable i had to wash several times before it con comfortable update the material did not last the sewing started to loose and they are no longer good,0
little thin not so warm,1
watch just wouldnt work stem fell out and wouldnt keep time waste of time and money,0
datas okay datas quite tired of falling and datas tired of skeletons use the stairs stairs the stupid guys tell me to use the stairs when datas falling if datas hurt nobody cares anymore then some guy tells me i have stupid inventions ive been spending months and months studying on them and inventing them god,2
great sunglasses for my six month old granddaughter,2
i was between ordering a medium and large i ordered the large and it was too short hit just above my ankle bone im about 55 so i generally dont have an issue with length,0
extremely comfortable and baggy love the large hoodie fits loosely but shapes to my body fun home outfit material is soft and very stretchy i ordered a large blue and it fits just like i wanted it to i probly could have bought a medium but i have a long torso so the large worked out,1
yes these fit great loved em,2
pretty colors ty,2
true to size minimal shrinkage,1
nice glasses like the polarized lenses too good cause,1
it was too small for my 4 year old nephew size wasnt mentioned on the description,1
this trifold wallet doesnt hold very much i had to really try to wedge dollar bills into the long pockets even when i am able it fits at the most 5 paper bills per pocket i do like the vertical display of the slots there are a total of 13 slots for cardsid etc creditdebit cards fit easily in each slot but if you fill every one of the 13 slots the wallet cant be snapped closed its also a little difficult to take a card out there is a zippered change pocket on the outside but it doesnt hold very many us coinsbr br the material is a polyesterpu material not slippery my opinion is that its a decent wallet but it doesnt hold much it would be best used as a travel wallet where you dont have that many bills or credit cards in it anyway,1
my nieces husband is very happy with this wallet,2
pretty but too small and too deep plunge,1
they dont look completely awful but theyre not particularly good looking either the clipping mechanism is pretty large and ungainly so from a lot angles its pretty visible i actually accidentally returned them when i mixed up the box with another one i was returning but i dont miss having them around,0
too loose for my ankle i will have to cut and sew it so it will fit,0
fitted very well i am happy about this,2
this is not one size fits most and material is so cheap lesson learned wont buy again,0
the straps on these sandals were far too tight otherwise it is a cute sandal the cushion seemed to be good but since the straps are not adjustable they had to be returned i found hush puppies blithe to be the perfect mix of cuteness and comfort be sure to check those out returned these and purchase 2 pairs of the hush puppies blithes,0
i ordered a large based on the recommendation but it is too large and lays funny in the back makes the straps look droopy and lord knows we women dont want something that makes us look droopy cute too but order 1 size down and i believe it will fit just like the photo,1
it feels like paper and it doesnt look cute on at all,0
not sure what i expected they are very thick but do keep feet dry,1
does not keep perfect time runs slow my son has to fix once a week,0
i got this because the price is right however i was hoping for something more durable or at least better crafting this plate frame just had stickers applied i sprayed it with several coats of clear spray paint in an effort to make the stickers last a little longer buy an embossed frame it will almost certainly last longer than this will,1
these shoes look a bit clunkier than other fisherman sandals i have they do have good supportcushion in both the heel and forefoot and are comfortable for walking there is not a molded arch support in the insole however the shoes are a bit long for the stated size and while the adjustable heel strap helps compensate for this it is not possible to get the shoes on and off without undoing the heel strap this means the heel strap has to be adjusted every time i put on the shoes additionally the tongue of the shoe is attached to all of the straps which limits adjustability using the elastic lace as well as contributing to the need to undo the heel strap to get the shoes on off,0
i have received both my first and second paid of compression foot sleeves the first ones seemed so promising for my foot pain i decided i better have a back up pair as well i developed plantar fasciitis after wearing too many flip flops over summer no i didnt heed the warnings i had a great deal of pain and decided based upon reviews given to try the sleeves i am cautiously optimistic as after wearing them for only about a week i have already noticed some improvement i am no longer in excruciating pain when i stand or walk i know there is a long way to go however i feel the sleeves are definitely having some impact and i hope to continue to improve,2
while the fit is good its pretty much a waste of money ladies i wore a tampon with the panties on a regular flow day and bled through the panties i got these to prevent an embarrassing event fail,0
i really do love this ring the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the center stone is not as clear as the images on the listing it is slightly yellow in some light i cant say if they are all that way or only the one i purchased its not yellow enough for me to return it or feel uncomfortable wearing it the cut is beautiful it feels like a quality ring the band is very narrow which i love the setting is perfect the diamonds around the center stone and on the band are very small and create a great halo i am going to add some photos so you can see the color it also arrived in a very pretty light blue box along with a card indicating its authenticity i took a photo of the side angle too so you can see how high it stands off your finger,2
i liked this shirt and my husband liked it too i worn this shirt on sunday people at church told me that i looked like a movie star,2
look cute but extremely easy to break broke the moment taking it off,0
i tried these because i couldnt find my usual sandals online still prefer the others but these are a great alternative,1
this shirt is a little scratchy thought that might be resolved after washing i wear a 3x plus sized shirt and bought this in a 4x overall it was a bit too tight and short and i was concerned that washing would shrink the shirt even more if i hadnt found an alternative that i liked better i would have kept and worn this but only because there are so few alternate options available in plus size not because i really liked the item if youre in a pickle and youre petite this may work for you but ill be returning,1
its crap not warm at all im a real person who works in a real factory wouldnt waste my money on it again,0
my daughter loves her new swim suit the color is true and it is made well the underarmor brand name isnt in your face which is also very nice shes not a walking advertisement,2
bright colors fabric is heavy enough to wear at winter season too,2
made well packaging was nice gave tools and instructions would definitely order from them again,2
awful dress even for the price the material that the bottom portion is made of even looks cheap i would never wear this dress i thought the photo was cute tho i guess im just going to use this dress as scrape fabric minus the bottom shirt like portion which went in the trash,0
the band is cool the only thing is that the leather is not good quality,1
thick silicone sticks well no slide works in apple watch,2
i got bigger because i heard they run small the slightly larger size is perfect for me,2
comfortable great for my workout,2
not good very sketchy manufacturing do not buy,0
i was pretty excited when i took this sweater out of the package and felt how thick and soft and cottony it was then i tried it on br br it says its boxy but on me its really boxy i usually wear a medium but this medium is big on me the neck is fine but the body of the sweater is really wide and the sleeves are longthey almost cover my hands completely a size small would have probably worked better for me im hoping it will shrink when i wash it,1
i liked how this ring looked but i didnt realize the flower actually sits on top of the ring so it isnt just a band like i hoped i dont know what size feet you have to habe but this ring was huge on me no matter how tight i made it it didnt feel tight enough the ring actually broke after only wearing it two days definitely would not recommend this product,0
good quality and really cute outfit fits as a 2t should i recommend it,2
bought this for my husband in a medium his normal size but had to exchange it for a large the large just gave extra comfort and length my husband loves it i also bought a camel color for my son he had the same size issue too short once we got it one size up it was a perfect fit i gave four stars due to length my guys arent giants one is 58 and the other 510 the sweaters were just too short and a little narrow however well worth just ordering a size up sweaters are gorgeous and comfortable,2
very pretty,0
pajamajeans are the greatest i broke my arm and i am onehanded i have to wear clothes that can pull onoff and i desperately wanted a pair of jeans that didnt have to be buttoned and zipped all i had was sweat pants my husband found pajamajeans on amazon so he ordered me one pair i assumed they would be ok jeans that i would give away once my arm was healed not so not only are they comfortable they look great on me and people constantly ask if i have lost weight i now own 4 pairs of pajamajeans and thats another thing they are affordable i love pajamajeans and plan to wear them now and long after my broken arm is healed,2
this was a good deal on mens undershirts by the old favorite fruit of the loom the fit was correct the material was soft and very comfortable to wear,2
this ring does not fit any of my fingers at all no size thing yall should get one you will get more money if u do,1
received this as a christmas gift from my boyfriend i love it its my new accessory,2
first i ordered based on reviews the top was way tight through the bustim a 36d also was a lot shorter on me than what the model indicatesim 510 finally the material is justrough i thought it would be smooth no stretch at all made me look like a grumpy old lady,0
husband loves his shirt good quality material and fits just right,2
this is very nice product very comfortable does pretty good job at holding all the christmas junk in should do the till i get started at the gym,1
when i got this i realized my mistake i had not read the description online if i had i could have avoided the spaghetti straps my daughter and i have similar taste in nightwear but this sleepdress didnt work for us,0
not worth the money sent back and did not even get the shipping back not satisfied at all,0
the white color is not white as shown it is defiantly a cream i bought this set because i needed a navy and white pair of mittens very disappointed,0
i like this shirt i just wish the pocket was sewn folded on top of the pocket because it lays open other than that i like the shirt,1
so apparently this is not silk as described but polyester the only reason for my purchase was because in the description this item is being sold as silk not silk blend or other blended materials but silk this is not silkbr br that being said i do love the color,1
a very hefty goodlooking watch excellent timekeeper with the miyota toughasnails jeweled movement the motherofpearl dial is a real eye catcher and the appliqued 34tiles34 that make up the divers helmet are a work of art in themselves i bought this one for a friend who had been admiring mine he doesnt take it off and for both of us the date window magnifier is an eyesaver no need to get out those reading glasses the price didnt break the bank either as other watches in this category easily sell for two to three times what i paidbr this watch is easy to read an attractive timepiece and accurate hoping for a 34gunmetal gray34 version someday,2
i love these my only issue is that some of them arrived bent at the top which is fine and easily fixable my main issue is that i received 1 less than i was supposed to get which doesnt seem like that big of a deal however i have a certain number i need to make for my order and it is super inconvenient i need the proper amount but i dont want to have to literally return them and wait for a replacement to be shippedi have a deadline to create my project i also ordered more than one from the same exact seller and for some reason they were shipped at different timesthe initial one arrived last friday oct 29th and the 2nd one should be arriving today according to amazon so im hoping they added the missing one to this order but well see if they even noticed for refence my order was placed october 26th so the 1st batch came 3 days later and the next one will be 6 days later if it does arrive today so just because you order it together does not mean you will receive it today if you have a deadline other than missing one the slightly bent tops of about 5 of them and them arriving at different times i am in love with them and cannot wait to use them once my missing one issue is solved i really hope i wont have to ship it back just to get one,2
ok first the pink color is the same pink as an onbrand highlighter its that bright so prettybr br next the bra in this suit rivals the high end suits sold at plus size lingerie storesbr br it has a clasp in the back to tighten the bust for additional supportbr br the straps are fully removable for strap free tanning they are about 1 wide so definitely comfortablebr br the pink fabric is a tad thinner than id like and really the only indicator that this is a 304000 suit and not a 15000 plus size suit,2
extremely comfortable fit is accurate as described will order again,2
i returned this top the fabric is thin and clingy not what i expected,0
a bit longer than needed due to its strachiness could have gone one size if this was known,1
you can see right through the material they run a little smaller in size but not much and then tend to slip down off the butt the soft material makes them slip down often,0
horrible broke as soon as i got it,0
good quality good comfort,2
i honestly wish i could review the ears separately i absolutely love these ears they are lace they are super comfortable and super elegant looking i usually cant wear headbands because they hurt my head but this doesnt dig into my head i wore this to a masquerade themed concert back in may i had planned on wearing the mask but honestly the mask is terrifying i had bought it some time in advance so i could make sure it was here in time and it ended up being past the return time so i just threw it away,1
these are one color there is no bleach distressing as shown in photo disappointed,1
these were extremely short size medium not at all what the measurements say on the size chart had to return,0
i like the fit nice design pattern pretty comfy good quality fabric,2
this was too small and there was no stretch as advertised,0
color is way off nice fit though,0
condensation on the inside and phone was wet,1
its cute just buy 2 sizes up doesnt fit to size,1
loved the style but returned it because the sleeves were incredibly itchy,0
the material has no body and i know if i wear it wash it i will never wear again,1
it came missing a few gems but other than that its ok,0
wear good,2
this arrived broken,0
somewhat small but very comfortable i will buy 1 size bigger if i were in your shoes,2
it brake down when i was trying this on the first time no further writting is neededit doesnt worth a single penny,0
works perfectly for what i needed it for,2
well i love the tshirt but its not a womens cut shirt even though its advertised as womens if youre looking for the womens cut move on this isnt for you,0
videoid349f2f2f3dee9c768c107c06ec24438d,0
cheap flimsy and really small i would not recommend this to anyone i wouldnt even pay a 1 for it,0
size no good,1
if you love dogs this is for you,2
they dont fit,0
nice quality fits well i bought the size 5 for my two granddaughters both are 4 years old one is thin and one is medium build and looks cute on both,2
bought this with the necklace for an 11 yr old gymnast she was thrilled with the necklace i decided to wait on these earrings as they are the same size as the one on the necklace and seem a little big and bulky on her tiny profile however the produce is well made and sparkles with pink crystals,1
better than expected,2
to thin and light weight,1
these socks are very comfortable for outdoor activities they go over the calf and stay up throughout the day even with rigorous usebr br they are warm enough for winter fun and they look pretty nice and sporty as wellbr br i waited to write this review until i had worn and washed them several times and unlike other similar pairs of socks ive used in the past these show no immediate signs of wearing out theyre tough and durable and i would certainly order more,2
it isnt what i thought itll be but its ok,1
helps keep moms clothes clean from spills and food drops covers her chest and some of her lap velcro closure works well,2
runs very small i sent it back,0
received knock offs from china not labeled in any way and foul smelling,0
first off you probably dont need to size up it warned that a medium tended to be small but jmo it was a typical medium second i see all sorts of reviews about how the pockets make you look wide they do because i think they are sewn in backwards and when you shift it to put your hands in them they poof out and lastly the material looks like a bath mat or bath robe still deciding whether to return or not but it was disappointing soft and comfy is the best i can say,1
item was listed as organic cotton it is not it is a plain gildan cotton tshirt fine shirt but not what i ordered i bought eight of these and had to return them all separately,0
fairly small and thin received a defective watch which is accurate for 60 seconds per minute but the second hand doesnt fall on the second indicator therefore it falls variously between the second indicators and makes it difficult to track exactly 153045 second intervals i will probably be returning this and buying a different watch since i need this for a nursing class and a second can be the difference in 24 bpm or rpm for heart rate and respirations,0
top of the dress color doesnt match the bottom very well cute though,1
i didnt like anything about these shoes,0
they are very cute shoes and fit her great,1
straps are a little weird but i still love it great fit and adorable,2
these shoes came from china and shipping took a long time when they arrived there was a very strong chemical smell from the shoes i couldnt smell the leather because this chemical smell overpowered everything i figured this was because shipping took so long and the shoes were sealed in a cardboard box within a sealed plastic bag so i had to air them out a few days afterwards the leather appears to be a bonded type of leather so not a solid piece of leather the sizing was way off being too big nothing in the package nor on the shoes could indicate that they possibly sent the wrong size because all words were not in english and there were no numbers that i could see so my son could not wear them at this time i will say that the foot bed was very well cushioned and appeared that they would be comfortable for long wear the soles are a grooved thick rubber thats very flexible the style of the shoe is attractive and appears to be well constructed my tip sizing is problematic so measure your childs foot and question the seller before ordering these i will donate because i dont know any other children who could fit them i wont send them back because it took so long to get here im afraid that summer and fall would be over before i got a replacement pair i received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review,1
absolutely love these tshirts comfortable and they dont shrink when washed this is the second pair that i have gotten,2
its good and looks nice,1
lousy product,0
i really like it as it is very soft and comfortable i personally bought it to avoid chaffing on my thighs i use it right on the waistline because if i bringing it any higher it rolls down and its extremely annoying as this is the part that i hate on most shapewear,1
most did not work,0
color said pink more like salmom,1
super cute and inexpensive but i just found out from the company these contain bpa kids put glasses in their mouth and bpa is readily absorbed through the skin not worth the risk i found roshambo glasses for babies and kids and they are free of bpa phthalate lead and latex and made in italy i originally purchased knockarounds because they had made a nontoxic version for the honest company but i guess the same cant be said for their usual glasses,0
lost its shape in a weeknot the right kind of shoes to wear at home for kids,0
i gave 3 stars because the socks are nice enough i ordered a 3 pack of gray heathercharcoalblackbr i received 2 pair of charcoaland one pair of navy i bought these as a gift for my 86 yr old fatherinlaw he has not been able to find gray socks in the stores nor have i i was willing to pay a little more just to make him happy he wanted different shades of gray and loves fluffies this fathers day will be the wrong kind of suprise,1
this was such a cute suit but the ruffle was too tight around the arms and the bodice was too long also the fabric was thin and belly button showed through,1
love the design and maybe its the difference in the types of fabric but it doesnt quite work the fit of the bottom with the black fabric is good but the upper part and sleeves are a bit tight im keeping it mainly because i ordered from overseas and its so difficult to return but otherwise i would return i would purchase from this brand again as ive had success with it before,1
nice shades,2
beautiful website picture but when i opened the package i was so disappointed this fabric is awful not appropriate for a summer dress,1
these socks are the best for that matter the entire darn tough socks are the best they have a lifetime warranty and are built sooo comfortably i catch myself wearing them around the house for no reason and dont care because if i wear them out ill just get another pair amazing cozy socks from a trustworthy brand,2
im sure these are great for shoes with very thick cushioned tongues but for any modern training shoe with thin material and light weight they are super uncomfortable the elastic is very thick so when it wraps between each shoelace eyehole the elastic makes a hard bend that digs into the top of your foot again probably not an issue if you have think tongues for your shoes but if theyre thin avoid these,0
way to small and dont have any stretch in them at all,0
lumpy and a cheesy go to hats in the bellfry and get the bellamy youll be very happy for ten bucks more plus shippingbr the return was easy and the hat is okay for a cheap hat thats why it gets three stars but you have to pay for return shipping even though its crushed when you get it and the corners dont pop out,1
i measure at a 34 band but would have needed a 36 in this bra the cups were a total nogo as well i even ordered up a size just in case knowing this was a s tight garment there is no way i can wear this so its going back i might consider getting another but id have no idea where to start with size,0
the colors were nice they seemed well made,0
returned,0
my daughter loves it she will grow into it,1
im large breasted double d and ordered an xl item is still a little small for my liking would have liked more room material is sheer and soft,1
to big and had a smell to it,0
not at all what was expected per sales description or picture horrible,0
i think its a cute dress just didnt like it on me i ordered a small but it seemed a little big fabric was nice though would recommend for others,1
it doesnt match the picture at all it arrived flattened and is flimsy,1
the pants are comfortable but very very loud walking around in thempeople can hear you coming from far off,1
arrived dirty like it had be worn,1
matte black finish is nice except when they attempt to cover up scratches with a big brush with glossy black paint looks like a child tried to repair it fits well otherwise would be a decent mask if it showed up in 34new34 condition,0
the lenses did not fit my glasses i have a pair of costa fantails and will be returning the lenses not sure if its my glasses or the lenses but the lenses were just slightly to big the lenses and cleaning solutions are a nice touch though,1
ok ring for the price paid the quality isnt as good as i would like,1
like the style and color the fit is a little snug i wear size 7 shoe also the toe part is rather small compared to other toe covers i have bought if it wasnt for the elastic band they would fall off very easily still okay for the money,1
too small,0
too large,1
i went online today to set up my return for this product and have found the return window closed this is unfortunate but when you dont receive any paperwork with it i simply forgot which is a bummer because i have no use for this now i wanted it for a couple of quick vacations and now that im home im super bummed i missed it by 5 days,1
love the tops but the weave on the foot is too loose,0
color and material as pictured true to size,2
i wanted to like it but it was way too big and looked more like a mans shirt not flattering at all had to return,0
very rugged and nasty do not buy,0
perfect and quick delivery,2
loved this top initially when i tried it on i actually wore it today for the first time its kind of tight on my boobs but fit is otherwise good i bent over to grab something off the bottom shelf of the fridge and the button in the back snapped off instantly had it on less than 5min dont wear if youre going to be moving around a lot im 54 120lbs and 34d fits my body really well but not enough room for my boobs hence the snapping definitely not for girls with larger chests,1
shirt is very cheap and the wig was a mess but it did the job for halloween,1
always a great shoe from new balance just wish that they would last longer,1
the jacket is a little thinner than i expected but really cute on my husband loved it on me with my 34biker boots34 he loves me n,2
good socks,1
the pants fit and they are comfortable but they dont look like jeggings at all they are leggings the pockets and stitching is printed on the leggings not what i expected smh,0
material is very stiff like plastic zipper has very large teeth that make it look cheap not a fan of this product its already in the donate pile,0
i have what i think are gold toe branded socks in the sock drawer but these im not sure are the right brandbr br first the socks received do not match the current product description pictures as of todays writingbr br second the reason for 2 stars is that the reinforced toe part is only reinforced for the first 3 toes please see the picture i uploaded my pinky and ring toe are quotloosequot and not in the reinforced toe part that orthese were simply manufactured wrong and the gold part of the reinforced toe was sewn incorrectly and only stretches the width of 3 toesbr br i have other socks with reinforced toes that are a different color and the reinforced part stretches the full width of all of my toesbr br the reason i didnt give 1 star is thata lot of my socks dont even have a reinforced toe at all so all toes are quotloosequot so at least this does have some partial reinforcement for the longestbiggest toesbr br overall not happy with these socks but they are still wearable and please note they do not match the product pictures at all,0
i really like this tank top,2
these run huge you will need to size down maybe twice ill update when i get a smaller size im normally a mediumsmall size 4br i went with a medium it fit like an xl,1
to be fair i am double lining nylon straps which broke one of the buckle but then i noticed another also broke on a normal strapbr br easy way to unnecessarily cut yourself,0
this akewei womens rain jacket lightweight hooded waterproof active outdoor quick dry running jacket definitely works as a rain jacket its longer than i expected and provides okay rain protection the jacket is hooded so i can keep my hair dry as well the problem with the hood is that there is no drawstring so it tends to fly off in windy conditions the elastic waistband gives the jacket a more tailored look than standard raincoats which is a positive but it also makes it more difficult if im wearing a thick sweater underneath or trying to layer im not sure why they also called this a running jacket because it would be too restrictive to run in if the zipper up the material also would not breathe well the jacket is lightweight though so i mostly keep it rolled up in my car for unexpected downpours the zipper works well and i like the contrast between the dark zipper and the rest of the jacket all in all this rain jacket is decent but flawed in some areas,1
they stretch out pretty quick with the hard use of a 4 year old but still worth the cost,2
nothing special i did not notice much difference,1
doesnt glow at all br but i like it,1
didnt like how it fit i was hoping for longer the front is really short and the back longer,1
the arms of the dress just wouldnt fit also after cutting them off i tried wearing the dress 1ce and it wouldnt stop sliding up ma bum had to go back home and take it off,1
perfect,2
absolutely not worth the money its just two flat rubber pieces the chest piece and the crotch piece that you tie around what is essentially a black wetsuit but every piece has something wrong with itbr br the arms and bottom part of the torso on the chest piece have no ties or velcro so they stay flopped out and look saggybaggy the top of the chest piece has velcro but theyre very small strips and im sure wouldnt hold up to too much movementbr br the mask is gigantic and floppy and i have a huge head so if it didnt fit me thats saying a lot it also has a piece of small velcro that holds it together but only in one spot and does nothing for the floppiness inside the mask it looks like a nightmare there was a spikey piece of rubber in mine that was right where your throat goes so not the most comfortable thing everbr br the boot tops are laughable theyre huge and have no way to adhere to your feet or legs so they flop around uncontrollably as you walkbr br the gloves are also huge dopey and floppy to make matters worse a couple of the fingers were melted togetherbr br the belt and cape i have no comment on because they were both missing from the costumebr br needless to say i returned the costume im 511 and 200lbs and i ordered the medium and it was still a giant mess they mustve molded this to fit one massive person and everyone else will just have to look like a blown out tire,0
this product is not true to size as stated its about 2 sizes smaller then actual size,0
no choice in bottom size,1
ehhhh i wouldnt buy these again,1
giftable,2
ok,1
the fabric is very thin and the pattern stretches and fades over your curves not worth the price,0
the leather is very soft and began showing wear almost immediately the tan backside leather split and came apart after a very short while definitely not worth the 36 i paid im sorry i bought it it did not match the more durable leather band that originally came with my wenger swiss military watch,0
my daughter loves her sunglasses,2
the outfit is cute but it had a pen mark on the bodice of it i wasnt pleased that it didnt come perfectly clean it was a gift,1
although i kept because it fit unlike others ordered in the same size this does not hold you in enough to exercise in good for lounging,1
im 57 and a half 165 pounds and these jeggings are perfect absolutely perfectbr and im very very picky about how things fit around my stomach these pants hug me perfect and they are true to your size i got the large the length is great as well i got zero complaints,2
roof,1
i bought these as a joke for my son who even as an adult plays too many video games in my opinion i thought it was hilarious and the whole family got a laugh out of the message on them they fit him perfectly and are a nice cotton material they seem to be well made and so far have been durable these are a very affordable gift for the gamer in your life and something to give everyone a laugh,2
stiff as wood sitting in the closet collecting dust,1
the elastic band at the top either needs to be taken out or it needs to be twice as wide and run through the whole waist band as is it creates the illusion of love handles or if you already have love handles im sure it would accentuate them if the elastic band was not the huge issue that it is i would give these pants 5 stars they are well made and the material is thick and comfortable but i cannot emphasize how horribly designed the waist band is,0
these are cute but very long almost too long to wear with many outfits,1
when i open the package and got my tie out i saw that it was cut other than that it was a really nice looking tie,0
still nice shirts but the fabric seems thinner and lighter than in the past,1
too small and cheap material,0
very tight im a 10 mens and heavy,0
slides off my head i go to sleep with it on and wake up with it off the head,0
soft wicks well no imposing seams fits perfectly cushioned footpad vibrant colors that does not fade after cold water wash fun conversation piece patternsfrench fries beer fried eggs hamburgers,2
the information says relaxed fit but nothing with or on these pants was labeled as relaxed fit,1
very cute and i get lots of compliments but i do have a bit of a reaction to it thats what i get for buying cheap jewelry i guess,1
this was the perfect tote for me in weight and size in my efforts to remove weight from my shoulder this accomplished that effort,2
these socks are very very thin,1
i loved the look and feel of these but the stitching came loose on the top of the shoe the 3rd time wearing them i would spend the extra money and buy a more reputable brand these are cheaply made,0
this sweater is nice enough its not oversized and its not chunky i ordered one size up xl and it just fits the sleeves do not hang like the picture and the sweater does have little bumps like the picture this is a fitted longish nondiscript sweater with little holes to ensure you will not be warm,0
too small,0
doesnt look like the picture but since i bought it to wear underneath a jacket i kept it its also see through,1
super wrinkly inexpensive looking you get what you pay for with this one,1
nice sturdy slipper can be worn outside to get the paper which is my sons chore the bottoms are thick but still pliable they do seem to run a little bit on the small size i had bought a size larger than he actually wears and these fit just right,2
definitely not the quality of the barton silicone straps but sells for much less it will fit me but is really too long for my 6 12 wrist so will be a problem for even smaller wrists buckle is a cheapo but might be ok for a cheap backup watch for your everyday watch life is short so spend more money and get the barton elite which also comes with an extra strap section for better fit options,1
nice shoues but runs small half size up,1
these earrings have become my new favorite they are well worth the price and are of a pretty good quality the advertising photo doesnt do them justice,2
this item arrived defective the snaps dont stay fastened,0
there is zero padding or built in bra so it is uncomfortable i wouldnt recommend for anyone over a small b in the chest,0
i like these they seemed thinner than i thought but they look delicate yet made well,2
im really impressed with this bag it fits a surprising amount of stuff and was durable enough to survive me dragging outside it all over osaka and kyoto for two weeks where it took quite a bit of abuse as far as the size goes i think it will fit in most overhead bins if it isnt filled all the way when stuffed it fits on larger planes,2
a good belt,2
the sweater was fine until i washed it lots and lots of fuzzballs that now must be trimmed off of the sweater,0
didnt like the pooch as a pocket and fades,0
these boxes are fine on the outside and feel pretty sturdy too they look all right and would have been giftable except for one huge problem the filler inside isnt cut to fit them perfectly in fact some filler was almost half the correct size also the material and appearance of the filler is extemely cheap and crappy looking its unfortunate they couldnt invest in better quality filler and cutting it to size properly i would never buy these again and cannot use them to gift jewelry i do not recommend buying these,0
i love earrings,2
the fit is wonderful and a absolutely the most comfortable lounging outfit ever,2
it could be due to my body shape i have small breasts and relatively bigger hips and buttso its a bit tight in that area even though i ordered my usual size its a nice dress and i received compliments but if i had thought it over sooner i wouldve exchanged it for one size larger,2
i gave 5 stars for the product itself but i received the wrong color birthstone i ordered this as a gift and was out of town when it arrived and had no choice but to give it with the wrong stone,2
love these they were exactly what i expected them to be super comfy i followed all the sizing recommendations that other reviewers wrote and it worked for me,2
these are huge not sized right not very comfortable either,0
these are very cute our lo seems really comfortable in them i did not give them five stars because there have been quality issues that should not come along with the price we have two pair of them this pair had a hole in the crotch seam after a few hours wearing them for the first time and the other pair arrived with an extremely stretched out waist band as compared to this pair they are really cute but have quality issues for the price,1
actually it was better than i expected,2
cheap fabric but what do you expect it was perfect for a night out,1
update 10202020br br ive discovered one of my cards is being damaged by taking it out of the wallet there are three card slots on the back side cards being taken out of the second center slot are being damaged over time the laminate of my bank card is starting to come up from removing the card over and over this is at the very edge of the card where you use your fingers to pull at the card its causing the strip you swipe to come off the plasticbr br i think part of the problem is that the card sits to far into the slot the top of the card rests almost on top of the slot this needs to be addressed i love the wallet but i cannot continue to use it i cant have it damaging my cardsbr br original reviewbr br i really love this wallet its so slim and holds money and cards perfectly i cant speak to the rfid blocking as i have no way to verify that it works and how well it works but this wallet is great and i would recommend it to everyone interested in getting a slim walletbr br you can put several cards into each slot if you need too and ive currently got quite a few 20s in the wallet and my drivers license and ccw in their along with business cards as well it can actually hold a lot more than it says and it has held up well,0
product was exactly as advertised,2
my husband is on the hunt for the most comfortable underwear these are good but not for him he found them to be slightly too short they are light and comfortable otherwise,1
its a bit small i should have gotten a size up but its cute,1
these are my favorite pjs they are soft stretchy and lightweight the only downside is that the inside of the material pills after some wear but even with that i still plan on purchasing more of these due to their comfort and style,2
the fabric is a bit scratchy and somewhat see through,1
the material was not breathable at all i threw the whole pack away because of how uncomfortable it was,0
it arrived wellpackaged it is the size i ordered the sleeves are so small i cant get my arms in and i measured correctly,0
fits perfectly,2
these flip flops have bumps on the inner sole of the shoe which dig into your feet otherwise they fit well,1
fits a little tight,1
i got two dresses for my twins in two different sizes an 8 and a 10 both fit smaller than expected but we made do i ordered the cream color and it was seethrough on the chest so they had to wear training bras and those created lines so it wasnt smooth and as pretty as i wanted another down side was the pleating on one dress was completely sewn wrong and all the steaming and pressing i tried couldnt correct the issue also they snag easily the baskets they carried caused snags across both dresses theyre pretty but now i know why theyre so inexpensive its cheap material i would recommend trying something different and i would certainly refrain from buying any light color,0
great colors soft and so kool,2
i have a 10yr old daughter who is very thin but longlegged i bought these thinking at least they would be long enough i was surprised how good they look on her i purchased more in other colors they are a little silkyfeeling very stretchy and fit her perfectly even after several washings they still look and feel brand new i love these,2
the tag says there is 20 cotton in the blend but it doesnt feel like it thin itchy material that i dont expect to last through too many washings,0
great product,2
i like the flannel lining i think fleece would have been to warm,2
after reading other reviews to size up and given the fact that i was on short time frame needed for a wedding i ordered 2 sizes up figuring i could take it in as needed it was still too small i dont know if it was mismarked or what but i could not wear it and packaging was accidently thrown away so now i a cannot even returnlove the dress but save your return slips,1
so comfy,2
pattyboutik is my favourite shop this jumper is fitted and perfect for curves the sleeves are very long with red and white stripes it is very smart and classy and comfortable to wear i am a uk 1416 and the l fits well,2
they are all rubber i wear a size 95 or 10 shoe reading the reviews i ordered an 11 sandal this is very close to being to small i kept it but if i had ordered the 10 it would be going back order a whole size largerbr comfortable i have very sensitive feet and worried that the 34nubbins34 would bother them no it actually feels goodbr ive worn these throughout the house and they are solid secure do not slip on tile or wood floors and do not gather static electricity on carpetbr im happy with them,2
eh its cute but it was kinda too large for me but then again im kinda a petite asian woman,1
these socks are cute and very comfy and so far have held up well through washing washed maybe 6 times since purchasing however theyre really big and floppy and the socks dont stay up well around my calves i wear a size 6 shoe womens and these socks are extremely roomy around the footportion especially around the toe to the extent that theyre a little dangerous to walk around in frankly the gripperdots on the bottom definitely help but i still have to be somewhat careful not to trip over all the extra fabric flopping around these are definitely slippersocks not regular socks they dont cling to your feet at all at least if you have smallish feet and i cant imagine trying to shove these in shoes,1
nice color but were way too long not capri pants went past my grandmas shoes,0
love these socks the fit is perfect i wear a size 75 the arch support is nice and snug,2
its too much work to return it and i wont wear it its too hot for miami feels very uncomfortable and its very tight and long for my size so i didnt score with this thank you,0
wasnt a huge fan of the fabric,1
looks like barbie hair also the head size is too small,0
they bent too easily the tags didnt make one flight before looking bent up,0
such a cute dress perfect for the office or going out,2
like the looks couldnt get it to go on i tried for over an hour to put it on,1
i ordered these shoes in black and fell in love with them they are beautiful and sexy but they hurt my feet so bad the straps by the toes starting cutting into my feet almost immediately i realize that this might not be the case for every person but if you have wider feet i would not recommend,0
years ago i had a northface beenie that i really loved and that fit my head nicely so i was really hoping that this one would finally be the replacement ive been looking for this one was really think like three times thicker than the one i had lost it was a little too long and the seams were very prominent and hard to make it look good on me i tried it on my kids and partner as well but none of us looked nice in it kinda bummed so have to return this one and keep searching,0
not what i was ordering doesnt look anything like what is advertised,0
came way too small in canadian size not us size,0
meh i wouldnt really call them luxury not in the least that being said we did keep them leather is kind of stiff and they are on the narrow side dont buy these expecting much support from the bottoms i would have returned them but my husband decided he wanted them anyway,1
great travel raincoat i wore it every day in europe i never got to test it in a hard downpour but during lightmedium rains it was fine looks good goes with anything black and i got large so it would never be tight and i could fit a packable down jacket under it really pleased with this great product,2
i disliked everything about these they are itchy the colors are not pretty i would not buy again they still sit in the package should have returned them,0
love the color a little small but still gorg,1
i dont get how this goes,0
its a lovely cross perfect size,2
i was going over some disturbing peta information taiwan is a country which has a rather nasty reputation when it comes to animal cruelty this is a place where dogs are rounded up and skinned alive i have seen a video a video of this taking place one reviewer says how amazingly soft the leather is and how can it be from a cow he might be wearing someones pet,0
i bought no 10 for my 15 monthold babyboy positives 1 wonderful quality 2 comfortable 3 very good price 25 these boots are a great value highly recommended,2
i am in love with these sandals very comfortable it was so nice to be able to find them in my size they are very stylish and look great with multiple outfits,2
these shoes are not leather as described my son put them on and wore them and theyre ok but they are some kind of smooth material feel plasticlike not leather at all,0
nice mittens and i love that theyre on a string but wasnt expecting that the shell was just cotton so they do get wet will probably only use these until the snow flies and then we will have to get some with a more waterproof shell to keep the cold out,1
and worse is that these are ugly i would not wear these even just in my home they are that yucky i dont like the style the fit or the material i am sure others will love it but they arent going to get any love from me,1
this hat is boxy in the front and does not fit like my other costa hats do,0
way to small,0
i bought this to match my daughters necklace of a baby elephant but no sooner had i put it on the chain broke,0
great fit,2
the gloves seem to be of excellent build quality but they are way too tight i tried both the 12oz and 14oz gloves the 12s i could barely get my hand into the glove the 14s i could but once my hand was in it was cutting off circulation i am 60 and 185lbs normal sized hands i have noticed that a few other people have mentioned the same issuebr br bottom line just be aware that these are very tight,1
sharp jacket so far so good read reviews about zipper issues i have been careful with mine and havent had any issues the zipper does work rather stiffly so i have been gentle with it,2
i am trying to down size from a mega purse it has presented some challenges however i love this bag it has a lot of pockets for organization and a back opening so you dont always have to open the magnetic asymmetrical side i dig the thought that went into this,2
girlfriend loved it nuff said,2
adorable bought in bright pink love it,2
its too loose and the slit is very big,1
i was really excited about this it was too big toobr heavy and just too much,0
while they work great they fit my shoe but not a mens 10 shoe,1
great shoes my son is delighted with its,2
i bought this sherpa coat for a trip to alaska and it is definitely not warm enough for my trip but it is very cute so u kept it,1
nice dress but pockets add bulk to hip area im curvy in the booty and hips and did not think this fit was flattering on me,1
amazing improvement over the 30 model i had for years these bend in every which way giving you an almost barefoot feeling stride,2
bought this for myself and absolutely love it well made and beautiful,2
the dress would have been really cute had the pockets been sewn in the same place on the sides of the dress one pocket was sewn so low it was only a couple of inches from the bottom hem i am so mad because i needed it for a sunday brunch tomorrow,0
i sent this item back it did not look live sterling silver it looked like stainless steel i was very disappointed,0
videoid29c18cf19cd2ccacbba5cae762ddcec3 should have just bought name brand thought these looked like they were sturdy but fell apart first time i washed them,0
i purchase a pair of these sketchers every couple years its more of a clog than a slipper great for wearing out of the house to run errands the sole is thick and has deep treads they are wide enough to wear with socks,2
this belt is really pretty and should hold up well but it doesnt fasten so tends to fall off while being worn,1
nice,2
it fits as expected my daughters love the color,2
this dress is very nicely made and the cut and styling is very flattering but it runs almost ridiculously small i ordered it in a size xxl which should have fit me fine if not a bit loosely but when i pulled this from the packaging it was clear that at best this is a largebr br very disappointing because this is a really cute dress and would look great in the workplace without being frumpy if only the sizing were accurate,1
earrings were much smaller than anticipated but very good looking nonetheless will look great in my second hole or great for a child,1
these are ivorycream like the picture not true white,1
these are only good for one wear they are so sheer that they snagged when i put them on do not buy this particular hose,0
poor quality,1
nice cushion only the size is larger that expected,1
way too small im 54br 125 lbs ordered large and it doesnt fit me how insulting hard to contact seller you need to buy return stamp and it cost 27 dont waste your hard earned money for piece of crap,0
my coat was extremely small and took about a month to get to me i normally wear a size 10 medium so i ordered 3xl the fabric was thin and wrinkled i contacted the seller to return it and they dont except returns they only offered me 30 of my money back not happy will never purchase anything without the prime logo,0
some reviews stated that they ran small so i sized up as im very tall way to big order your own size,1
great shoes,2
i ordered 2 of these one in white and one in black and they are different the rib is thicker on the white than the black the black ended up being more comfortable,1
not thrilled with it but its ok decent hangout outfit,1
really cute and fit perfectly,2
i used this wallet for a week the flag is already off of it and the wallet has ripped in several places the id slots was not big enough for my id or debit cards or anything else also when the flag was on there it was crooked,0
i am usually a smallmedium in tops and got the size regular f and it fit perfectly i did end up having to take out the padding but thats no big deal to me its literally exactly as pictured and so soft,2
perfect,2
did not fit my samsung phone,1
brown,1
glue was dried could not use at event disappointed kids,0
ordered a extra large when i got it i could not pull the jacket over my head very disapointed,0
fit is good and they seem sturdy enough but the fabric is very prone to wrinkles,1
they did not match one was longer than the other,0
i found them to tight for comfort around my knee,0
the most uncomfortable boot ever it runs big and slips on your heel but with a heel insert theyre bearable if thats all you afford for this style,0
best boot i have found for use on concrete floors this is my 3rd pair toe cap keep boots looking new,2
works as expected 2ds charges fast,2
ive had these boots for 8 months now almost daily use though not rough or hard use by any means the waterproofing was awesome and the boots were really nice until they werent i started noticing that my right heel was getting damp and cold upon closer inspection i discovered that my boot had split 23 of the way up the rear very disappointed i had hoped to get at least a year out of these oh well i guess that i wont be buying these bates again,0
im fairly disappointed with this mainly because it does not look nearly as nice as it does in the picture in the image it appears to sturdy and well made in reality its flimsy costume material and appears cheaply made this looks like the kind of thing i expect to find at a local costume shop during halloween the emblems are screen printed and not embroidered as they are in the image and for some reason despite ordering a medium i received a large but this proved beneficial since the large is barely big enough for me a large has never been less than too big for me i range between smalls and mediums generally so when i saw the label for large i expected it to be hugebr overall this jacket is not horrible but not as nice as the pictures of it led me to believe,1
if you want a shirt that works as a snug layer this is it i use it under my work shirt and vest kind of snug to wear by itself for me to wear just by itself though ill keep it for a layer it is soft and stretchy,1
i had to return they were just too small for me i wanted them for working outside and they just werent a good fit,1
feels cheap and the pockets for the credit cards are either too tight where you cannot get the cards in and out or they are too loose where everything freely slides out overall not a well made or designed product,0
these are cute comfortable shoes i really loved them at first but ive been wearing them for about two months and they are falling apart the bottom sole is coming unglued the fabric is wearing through in places im not that rough in shoes,1
ordersed womens xxl appears to be about a typical small the only tag is a unmarked label that says 4 if that means its a womens 4 thatd be a small,0
great quality size was smaller than expected requested return and have not heard from the seller,1
the quality of the sweater isnt great but good for seasonal wear im not sure how it would hold up in the wash probably hand wash and air dry however it fits as expected and is fun,2
difficult to open and close,0
i bought at least 5 items to hang earrings and this was by far my favoritebr the holes are spaced enough to allow large earrings next to each other you can put post earrings or hook earrings it is sturdy for its plastic material and hasnt fallen over even though i have moved it many times i like that you can put it in 3 different positions i may even take the frame off and just attach it to the wall,2
zipper pull is sewn into side seam obviously little to no quality control,0
nice bracelet but the goldish clasp looks very cheap,0
my son loves these sooo much they are so cute and comfy and it makes him wear indoor shoes when its cold and drafty on the hardwood floors,2
they dont fill like 95 cotton,1
box was ripped up how can you give it as a gift disappointed,1
i bought these for my boyfriend as a christmas present and he loved them when he opened them but they were a lot smaller than i anticipated they looked tiny on his ear lobes i almost returned them because i found out the posts bend really really easily on them i just bent it back with a needle nose pliers and they were good as new just dont bend them back too many times they feel like they could snap easily too,1
this shirt run small for xxl this wasnt for me at all,1
shipping was fast and i like the stylelook of the product my main complaint is it was so damn difficult to get open the snaps were clasped together soooo tightly it took my boyfriend and i both to pry it apart to even get the thing on me and then we almost didnt get it off its a good product for a very good price but make sure you really like it because the only way youre getting it off is ripping it or cutting it,1
cute dress but ours arrived with a hole at the top look it over before you decide to keep it,1
i ordered an extra large which is my size and it was way too loose and baggy had to return and order a large which for my taste was still a tad bit too baggy,1
not quite what i expected im 56 130 lbs 34b i ordered the medium and guess it fits okay tight wise but the armpits seem too big and the sleeves are too short however looking at the product photo that does seem in line with it i guess i just didnt realize that before also the fabric is soft like fleece on the inside and shiny like spandex on the outside which makes it pretty warm i ordered it as a dance top so the warmth is a little impractical for that but maybe others would like it overall not quite what i was expecting,1
i ordered the medium but it is still too big fingers too long the touch screen feature is virtually nonexistent looks good though,1
i really like this purse it is more of a gold than what i view as kachi it holds all my misc stuff but i wish the outside rather than the inside zipper opening had the inside zipper pocket,2
a little too old lady looking for me snug at the opening i wouldnt want to struggle getting them on if i was older strap is longer than necessary and i just dont need it maybe if you wear them all day theyd be okay soft material,1
this is a nice summer top my one complaint is that the fabric crossover on the breasts gaps a bit so you need to either pin it or have a bra that doesnt exacerbate the gapping i tried doublesided fabric tape and that didnt keep the gap closedi solved the problem by wearing a thin bra with no padding,1
i love this hoodie but after only 4 months the zipper slider broke,1
fits great and the color was just as i ordered,2
not lightweight enough to be worn tucked in without going up a pants size no heavy enough to be worn outside pants because tail of shirt curls when you sit on it looks ridiculous from behind all curling up,1
this was one of 2 pandora items i purchased for my mrs for xmas of course i caved and gave it to her early the look of surprise on her face said it all,2
cheap plastic really wasnt worth what i paid for it,0
returned because it was bigger than i had realized but its a super bag returning it was very easy,2
very long smmed im 54 calf size 1213 they where 34 above my knees they are soft and comfortable,1
item looked in real life exactly as advertised bought for my mils birthday and she loved it so cute would buy again,2
great hats and very warm,2
box was empty no keychain,0
this is one of my favorite dresses i purchased off amazon im 53 128 ilbs size 46 and purchased a smallbr br prosbr true to sizebr lightweight materialbr twirlsbr didnt come wrinkledbr consbr sleeves move up a bit when moving,2
the cheapest brittle frames i have ever encountered in a so called sport sunglass product the right temple arm broke during normal use,0
do not buy thisbr i loved the idea but the medical alert symbols fell off about the time the return period closed i emailed the seller but hear nothing back from them probably because they knew i couldnt do anything about it,0
if you are looking for a very light weight sock this is the one for you i was looking for a bit more material there they are not super warm in the cold weather they are likely going to be better for hotter temps the design is cute though,1
goes well with my costume but hope to see better bastet masks in the future,1
nice mediun jacket,2
nice but i prefer something with a little more going on in terms of design and the sleeves were very long,1
the band is so cute but it is too small for my wrist maybe i should have paid closer attention to size but ive bought halloween christmas and winter themed bands from different sellers and they all fit,0
it was a bit to small but as it was for a kentucky derby party it worked fine,2
not a fan of the fit,2
build quality is really cheap,0
my son was so excited about getting this mask when he opened the package the mask was cracked and bent it was shipped in a polymailer envelope its a super thin plastic mask it should have been sent in a box to prevent it from breaking,0
good for de manny,2
not true to the size i got the exact shoe size and it was way loose and the material is so thin,0
the ruched bust wasnt very attractive the fit wasnt the same as other dresses ive bought from this brand it felt tight and restrictive overall i did not like the fit of the dress and sent it back,0
i didnt order order the size amazon recommended and i wish i would have they are a little too big but they are are the softest most comfortable slippers i have ever owned socks help from keeping them from sliding on my feet i bought these because i have heel pain and they have a thick sole i will buy these again but in a smaller size,2
fit nicely but absolutely no moisture wicking wouldnt recommend being very active while wearing them,1
they fit really loose wide i have to curl my toes to keep them on my feet if i walk with them but i love the memory foam souls,1
the color is nice very soft lining but the fit is too large i ordered the 7 8 size and i wear a size 7 12 unfortunately these are not comfortable at all there is no plush or cushion at all i can feel the hardness of the bottom of the slippers these feel like shoes not at all like slippers i had to add several insoles to help give these some cushion these will only be temporary slippers till i get others to replace these not worth the money,0
the dress arrived broken several holes in the entire seam definitely something that does not work and can not be used i feel that my money was stolen,0
excelente,2
im familiar with 34no show34 socks but these did not cover the top of my feet its like a weird liner and it made me uncomfortable inside almost creeped me out what of shoes are they expecting me to wear with these,0
i had ordered another brand of wool socks for winter time over seas but after a few wearings i couldnt wear them anymore i have small feet 55 shoe size an the other socks had started bunching up every time i walked very annoying most places didnt offer a smaller sock so i took a chance when i found these theyre not super heavy but they fit and i find them warm and comfortable great for people who dont want a super heavy sock and who have a smaller foot size id get these again,2
so comfy love love love,2
nice quality cotton shirt clear image and good colors all for a fair price,2
very cheaply made,0
great fit breathable i teach dance full time and it works great,2
broke early on not worth it,0
i bought this for a gift my friend loves it it was a great price and came in a timely manor,2
been waiting for a watch like this for a long time and im 82 finally a digital with big numbers that show up in just about any light looks great too comfortable everything works as advertised well dome casiobr semper fibr mike,2

wish i had searched more,0
i have had my bag a few days over a month the strap snapped,0
it is pretty good but not very comfortable the collar rubs the chin and nothing can be done about it i kept it to wear around the house but it is too expensive for what it is i should have paid extra and bought the real thing also the real thing is longer this one is much shorter,1
i ordered a small and would of liked it a little more fitted but great easy to wear dress,2
i am an xl in shirt size i read that this shirt ran small so i ordered a 3x but it its tiny so small it looks like childrens size it does not fit me at allbr do not order 3x unless you wear a womens small,0
tha necklace chain is extremely unattractive the stone is too large to wear,0
i need it to use with my ugg cleaner,2
not good for under dresses and play totally see through even without bending over,0
received item on time except some of the gauges were broken,1
these bras are not to true size run small,0
all the stones were either loose or broken out of the gauntlets returned,0
kinda cheap looking,1
too small,0
does not look like picture and material cheap no shape to it way to big for medium,0
the straps break off the mask with even just a gentle handling so many masks wasted with not even being used,1
this is very small it barely fits over my head i love the overall idea and i think it is functional but i really wish it was bigger,1
good for kids costume but looks ridiculous for an adult costume very small,1
so i definitely ordered a medium in this set and the outfit that arrived is what im guessing is an xl when i went to review my order it didnt show a size and now it seems like they only have one size the pattern is super cute and the material is nice enough im just bummed it doesnt fit,0
my husband and i like fullzip hoodies because we can use them every day unfortunately this one arrives with many issues while the double layered fleece is a soft quality and not pilled there are still multiple issues this is a supposed to be a mens hoodie but the zipper is lined up like a womens i bought a medium my husband is an average height 59 but the length is a little short when he stretches with it zipped it rises above his waist the waistband is sort of lumpy now he just keeps it in the back of the car in case he forgets his other onebr prosbr soft materialbr no pillingbr consbr zipper pull on womens sidebr runs short rises above waist linebr lumpy waist bandbr over pricedbr br i purchased this product at a discounted price discount for my honest review and they are 100 my own opinions i obviously received no compensation for this review or associated with the seller in any way,0
my 3 year old son loves these sneakers hes in 105w right now but figured since he loves them so much and theyre at a great price id buy him his next size up,2
you get what you paid for buyer be ware if you have any boobs whatsoever this is not the dress for you,0
used them for a misty costume for halloween the clips seem flimsy they arent very strong at all which is fine for a costume but if i was slightly taller than i am i think they wouldve kept snapping off all night i only needed them once though so it was fine for me just seem very weak,1
i bought it to wear for my brothers graduation ceremony but returned it due to ill fitbr br prosbr nice material and patternbr br consbr breast area was too stretched out when i wore it,0
too small,0
love these,2
very thin more of an early fall coat runs small,0
i love everything about these except that they make a mark on my nose ive nebet had sunglasses do that,1
too small on top have to return bought a small pattern wasnt as pretty in person,0
looks great 56 140 bought large love it washes well,2
they are a bit bulkier than i would prefer but they do the trick and look pretty cool too,1
the picture looks more expensive than the real thing it changed color after the second wear waste of money,0
do not waste your time buying this shoes first i ordered my size 85 and was so big for me and material are 99 cents never ever,0
good gloves good brand,2
the cuffs frayed pretty quickly but it is very nice looking,1
its pretty and looks expensive i wear it as a mini crawler and as a drop down as well and it look good great for office wear i did change the backing to my own as it comes with curled backing thing sorry not sure what the correct term for that is,2
if you buy an item and they are asking for a tip at the selection page be warned,0
real nice watch you cant go wrong kick in the a japanese movement along with crystal no brainer for me but im polish lol the band was some work to thank on links so the band would fitbr 5 stars for a well good looking chinese watchbr,2
theyre a good quality cotton knit fabric the construction is done wellbr i ordered these for my husband he was used to wearing regular boxers and thought he couldnt get used to them thats the only reason for a 3 star rating,1
im really happy with this blouse it fits as expected and the material has a little give for a larger chest also it washes really well i wish the color were a little brighter but overall very happy with this purchase,2
length is good neck opening is a tad small very lightweight material but has no stretch to it whatsoever my only issue is that this was advertised as being true to size im 64 345 lbs with a 58 inch chest and the chest is almost snug a typical us 4xl is a 5860 chest so measure your chest if your a 60 inch it wont fit abdomen fits normally though,2
i liked this when i put it on but after swimming in the suit it stretched out and is to big,0
smaller size fit perfectly,2
wanted a loose fit this was too firm fitting great material and well made but i wont be wearing it until i lose some weight which i am not big at all more just curvy but i dont like a form fitted sweater dress,1
terrible quality,0
this crisp looking jacket gives a professional appearance while providing plenty of comfort the material is light and features a usable left utility pocket the buttons are white and it is true to size there is no binding or tightness and it provides a full range of motion it launders beautifully and seems well made it is an easy way to look sharp in a hot kitchen,2
love only complaint is when they get dirty with mud for example its very hard to wash from the material its like it gets stuck in the grains on the materialbr otherwise its a comfy fit and they look good,2
the fit is okay a bit tight in the thighs i ordered a large and wear a 3634x3034 jeans and have big legs its also really long need to roll it up to keep it from dragging on the floorbr br its cotton which is good but its a bit thinner than i expected and the fake drawstring lack of pockets and elastic band are not good the crotch also does not open from the front which is good or bad depending on what you wantbr br really though how hard is it to make a decent sleeplounge pant,0
this panty was made out of very nice light thin silky fabric unfortunately the way the pantry is cut at the hip area creates two lines that are not flattering under form fitting clothesbr i recommend jockeys french cut cotton comfies panties they are seam free soft breathable and super comfortableand last for years,1
underdress quite small for the size of overdress but customer service was excellent,1
love these pants feels and look good easy to maintain and goes with any sneakers,2
this shirt is very soft and fits great but this is what happened on the second time i wished it its got a very grungy look to it anyway so ill continue to wear it but nowhere in the car instructions did it say how to avoid this the rainbow is basically melted to the other side and i had to rip it to get it a part leaving residue on the rainbow,1
most times i buy a large this brand was way too big not too flattering because it will looked boxy on me i did not repurchase in a medium but a medium might be a better choice size down,1
these look a lot better than i had expected theyre a bit long for me but this is easily fixed they are incredibly comfortable too,2
i get so many compliments on this ring its so cute and so easy to fit any hand people think i paid so much and then i say its from amazon and they stare in wonder get it just dont think about it,2
i bought these sloggers for my husband to use during yard work big mistake the soles hold every bit of dirt and soil from the yard they cannot be stomped clean or banged against the floorthe clumps of dirt however are readily seen all over my front porch and doormat the pressureforce needed to hose them off causes the insole of the shoe to get soaked as well also it was recommended to buy 12 size largerthat i believe is because they are trying to sell an insole to tighten them up as if the dirt and poor sizing were not discouraging enough they make walking on grassy or bumpy terrain an ankle breaking accident waiting to happen bottom linesave your money and buy rubber shoes from walmart for under 500,0
the shirt is ok its a bit shorter than i was expecting and the neck is wider and hangs off of the shoulder a little more than the picture shows not terrible but also not the look the picture portrays,1
i always get people noticing this shirt and laughing,2
when i first opened the package i thought it was defective because of the strapping only one side has a strap and the other side has two loose ends would prefer straps on both sides i just tie a small knot in the front to connect the loose ends and then tuck them away inside my bra,1
color not as bright as shown fabric rough and cheap looking horse print faded looking i will return this item,0
ordered these to use for work during the summer comfortable and lightweight arrived damaged though initially thought it was just a scratch on the top of the shoe which wasnt a big deal to me but then realized if it was actually sliced through the shoe,0
took like months to arrive and i dont like that its shiny but otherwise its what i expected,1
the fabric is thinlightweight its summer so i am fine with that the dress patterndesign is pretty but it runs small in order for the dress to have fit me i would have needed to order a size larger,1
these do not do what you expect them to do the butt area is not sewed correctly to lift the butt the one star is because they are comfortable and not see through at all i will wear these only in my home gym because they look like a worm hole and i do have a butt and these pants make me look like i dont,0
looks better in the pictures,1
very cute shirt i usually wear a medium in shirts like this but based on other reviews i did order a small i found the small to be slightly big on me but not too large that i would return,2
the sheerer pairs are too delicate for trouser socks these are more like kneehis,1
this product arrived on time and in perfect condition packaging was perfect but unfortunately i have decided to return this product due to the following reasonsbr quality good but the fabric definitely not of sweater type this is more like a long loose full sleeved tshirtbr im 52 120 lbs us size 24 petite overall this shirt fit me horribly the chest was of just the right fit but that is the only good point about this shirtbr this shirt is definitely too long for my taste comes up to my knee i assumed that pairing this with leggings might work but it still looked very awkwardbr i tried using a shirt belt and wearing this as a dress but this shirt doesnt have a good shape overall so again this gave me a very awkward lookbr the sleeves extended a inch longer than expected also the sleeves were too loose for mebr hence ive decided to return this shirtbr but that being said i must stress that this shirt is still of a good quality not sweater but definitely a good tshirt the color is very close to what was given in the product description also the buttons are of good quality so my opinion is that in case you are more than 55 tall this shirt might work for you,0
i wish i would of read the reviews first because the wrist band doesnt fit the frame not even with my original band the part where the pins are a tiny bit big and it makes it so that doesnt fit but i must say its a pretty and very smooth band too bad it didnt fit,1
fit well,1
25,1
bought this boa for a 5 year old who was part of our dance routine and she loved it it was the perfect size and she had a great time shimmying it around her shoulders and lifting above her head,2
just as described,2
i hate to say this but i think im just going to toss this jacket into goodwill box it looks really cheap to me of course it didnt cost much but i have bought lots of stuff on here that was cheap and looked real expensive this definitely does notbr it looks like a jacket you would get at a very very cheap discount store,1
very good product comfortable,2
clingy material cheaply made returned,0
fits well doesnt bother me while im cooking or doing the dishes,2
watch looks great but a few months in and second hand fell off and blocks other hands,1
i love the way it feels when on but wish i would of gotten smaller size my granddaughter wore it before me lol,2
this product was supposed to be b cup i am a plus size woman and was excited to find bras in my band size and cup size to be highly disappointed the cups state they are b but are way larger and the way they have been stored and shipped caused permanent creases in the cups returning for refund,0
love the color but seriously it is way to difficult to bend and i have no end caps to fit where can i get large enough holes endcaps,1
not very comfy slid down,0
ive ordered a blue pair and a black pair of the full length iuga pants with pockets xxl im 52 and currently around 200lbs and my weight is carried in my hips and thighs while i have a weirdly narrow waist i have pretty a very short torso so when i do pull these up they are well above my belly button but still almost too long and bunch around my ankles i wore these hiking with my friends and they were very comfortable and pockets were easy to use and didnt feel they stretched too muchbr br ive worn them biking and playing tennis and they do tend to start to slip down in the crotch the way tights often do its not terrible but ive got to readjust and pull them up after about 20 mins of major physical activity they are not see through which is the best part i was never the type of person to wear skin tight anything but i felt these looked good enough i didnt care the waist does start to slip and sort of rolls down but not as bad as some other types of leggingspants that ive owned thus the 4 star instead of 5br br i like the long ones enough to order a pair of the capri ones and was really disappointed in those they shape in the legs is cut very differently and they felt very uncomfortably tight around my calves from the seam which felt like it had no stretch didnt have that issue with the long ones i returned the capri ones,2
this is the perfect beanie its cute and cozy but also doesnt mess up your hair if you want to pull it off once youre inside and starting to get warm the poof is big and fluffy and also removable for packing so it doesnt get flattened out,2
the quality and feel is good for a young girlbut too small for womanly c or d cups i am 32 d or 34c and the medium fit around but squashed me and hiked up in the back i wish they made this just a little bigger for older women or women who lift weights,1
these are so elegant yet lightweight great price too they dont weigh my ears down,2
very cool shirts my only complaint is that they are very fragile and the sizing is a bit weird i own four of these shirts all in the same size none of them for the same i feel fun when i wear these,2
it fit perfectly this was a large,2
this is light and comfortable but surprisingly it lasted only 5 monthes as shown in attached pictures it had defects in stitches and bonding i am an office worker so do not walk that much so very disappointing,0
based on other reviews i had hope no such luck colour was great bottoms fit great but needed more support in top for natural ddde,0
love these comfy soft i want them in every color,2
the tops is very light fabric and more faded out than photo the first one i ordered was too small but the company was very accommodating and send a larger one and didnt charge shipping the newer one is too large but i didnt want to deal with it,1
not a nice dress i bought size s and is huge it looks cheap,0
junk,0
orderd a 9 it fit like a 10 then orderd a 85 its to small send me another 85 reviews say some colors fit smaller then others,0
this makes my 5th pair of fivefingers all of various models kso trek was my fav but i wore them out the spyridon seems to fit the tightest of all models except the lontra the spyridon laces are quite short so if you have high arches they are a bit of a struggle to get into once on they are snug but comfy though i fear my big toe will pop through the fabric over time im kinda hoping they will loosens up with age the sole is also somewhat stiffer than trek im looking forward to loving them as i have all the others but im not there yet,1
the seller claims the capris are soft for me these are scratchy and not soft very disappointed,0
awesome,2
i love that these are a nice lightweight for summer im just not at all sure how they can fit up to shoe size 10 since i wear an 8 and theyre a little snug they also cut into my ankle a little and feel a little rough i would love to see the quality improved in these for a better fit and feel with the same light weight,1
this was such a cute bathing suit im 58 132 lbs cup size is 36dd the xl top is waaaaay too small the bottoms were waaaaay too small i would have just bought bottoms in the smaller size but if the xl wont cover by breasts theres no winning for me,1
it was shorter than i felt the pictures portraited we are long wasted women,1
works fine be sure to follow the instructions,2
the first time i wore it the insole already was folding and was not stickingbr not so good quality,1
this fell apart getting it out of the package i was able to make another necklace out of what i had on hand but there was no way to repair this one as is i hope the teacher i gave it to really enjoys it but it would have been better for me if it had come out of the package as it looks in the image beads went everywhere,0
sleeves too snug to comfortably wear rolled up as shown material looks and feels like wrinkled plastic not soft looks cheap odd fit generally color is pretty though,0
i want fond of the material of the shorts quality is very poor and thestyle doesnt reflect the picture overall i had to return because it wasnt worth how much i paid for,1
even though i dont wear slippers much in summer i bought these in may and they wore through by july maybe the wear pattern shown in the picture says more about me than the slippers but it isnt wear i have experienced with any other kind of footwear i have disposed of them now because while they were a good fit when new they are now very loose and i am concerned that they could be dangerous on stairs,0
the choker broke the first time i tried it on the clasps and chain is not made well,0
these socks are perfect for boot wear just make sure of your size and the type of boots you are wearing for city suburb or complete outdoors,2
this feels really uncomfortable on the skin its has this scratchy feeling when i wear nothing underneath its very warm especially when i wear a coat over it its short around the waist,0
does not stay hooked and runs small,0
these earrings are cute and very pretty they sparkle and although small are very noticeable they go with my pandora beads which is why i purchased them i may get more colors,2
i purchased a couple of these for my two daughters okay for the price you have to look really hard to recognize the mermaid figurevirtually indistinguishable and not as pictured the pieces were not as sturdy as i hopedone of my daughters snapped hers in two trying to stretch it to fit her ear cute and different but i might spend a little more next time for something of better quality,1
really disappointed to have received suits that had clearly been tried on and not checked for cleanliness when sent back,0
i am mediately return this after taking it out of the box very cheaply made base with scratched dont waste your time,0
i have 2 and i like them both but dont let the big american flag fool you its made in china,2
this would be cuter if it actually fit like the image as described i still wear it with leggings as a long shirt but its more fitted i would order a size up if youre ordering this product maybe even two sizesits quite short i am 57 and i have long legs so there is no way i can wear this out in public without leggings,1
if youre looking for a small flat nose stud this is for you yes it does come in a package of 20 but from my experience these are easy to misplace youll want the extra studs im very happy with the quality fit,2
i dont write reviews often but i had to for this this shirt is paper thin and super crappy for the money paying over 20 for a shirt this thin and easy to rip is ridiculous one belt snag and this shirt was trash dont waste your money on this,0
really cute and comfortable shoes they look cute with capris shorts or ankle jeans the rhinestones are no too much or look cheap,2
not the greatest materialquality for actually going out im using it for a costume which should be fine,2
bleh cheap material and cut too large,1
colors are so vibrant,2
i was very pleased with the fit of this item however the cross straps on the right sleeve did not say where they belong the upper cross was way too long any item is being returned,0
they patterns were cute but too big for my legs i ordered a lxl bc my calves are 16 inches in diameter will reoder in the smaller size in a perfect world they would come in individual sizes,0
the shirt is cute but too tight in the arms being too tight in the arms causes it to bunch weird across the chest definitely size up if considering this,1
very durable just hard for 4 year olds to get on,2
we bought these boots for a christmas present thats what my niece wanted so thats what she got they dont appear to have much arch support,1
it seems that it a little smaller,1
i order a large for myself a 125 pound adult female with a 34 chest i was looking for tight tank tops without a really low cut like in most womens clothing i like the fit its snug but comfortable material is pure cotton i was disappointed because the photo is inaccurate theres one white one black and one blue tank top in this package the photo should be changed so customers know what theyre buying,0
a few points the tshirt is made well enough i have no complaints therebr br the lettering of the shirt is yellow not orange as describedbr br the lettering is a rough iron on vinyl it isnt screen printed and you can feel the edges too easily as someone who works in vinyl every single day i can tell you that these letters will peel up after a few washes its badbr br the label as no washing instructions thats just weirdbr br the only thing good about this shirt is literally the tshirt itself,0
i love these for my yoga or working out they never leave you steaming and are terrific to spend your time in a gym in in,2
not at all what i thought it would be,1
exactly what i expected and proud to wear it,2
the bracelet fall outbad quality,0
the fit is quite tight and not really ample in the buttocks area,1
fit is true to size love the wicking perfect for the gym would perchuse again,2
i ordered 2 of these im different colors and the first fit great and exactly as expected but these ones were a completely different fit and not at all close to the size i ordered they were way too small but also very uneven with the waist being average but smaller than the size i ordered an the thighs being very loose but the legs are extremely tight they were also very very short,0
just recieved these today i cant say about durability yet but it looks to be a really good boot theyre cute for my boy and he loves them so far they have a thick tread and seem to be real leather not floppy boots they are stiff but not hard im hoping these hold up better then his old ariats,2
the description says full grain leather this is not full grain leather it is some of the cheapest looking leather ive ever seen,0
it doesnt actually glow unless u have time to charge it under a black light and even then it barely glows in the daylight,0
it was very clingy and i cant stand it,0
this was insanely large for a size 2 it was really more like a size 4 or 6 the dress itself was nice though sent it back because it was huuuge,1
its tight in the hip and crotch areabr im 5634 140 pounds if you can size up you may want to consider doing that i still kept it because the alteration to fix this minor problem was ease enough for me,1
comfy socks,2
are u kidding mei didnt get it and you dont answer meback my moneyor send me again,0
no as good quality as i expected but will work,1
my daughter thought i had on pajamas when i tried it on,1
love ithalloween here i come,2
i normally wear a size large and i ordered an xlarge and still too small otherwise material and appliqué are good quality,1
very seethrough the dress is light flowy and soft will use it as nightgown overpriced,1
this shirt was short when be got it and shrunk so far in the first cold water wash that is doesnt even reach his waist no its nice heavy fabric now but order it about 3 sizes too big,1
these sandals are so comfortable as in the have good arch support toe depressions and the straps i was so disappointed that when i walk my feet slide out which is so uncomfortable sadly i cant wear them i wish there was a back strap,0
adorable satin cloth fabric purse i was able to fit my iphone 11 a small wallet and car fob small top lock no hinge looked great light weight chain not too long i was able to cross body the bag also,2
great item,2
grand daughter loves them made very well great price,2
these pants are light weight and fit good i live in key west its hot and humid these pants look good and feel good thin and comfortablebr for the price definitely invest in at less one pairbr judge for yourself,2
sooooo adorable,2
videoiddd25ff3d9aa24118d8a085edb0abc00b i ordered a size medium and im 59 145lbs and this jacket was huge looks like a mens jacket it looks nothing like the picture advertised i wont be buying anything from this seller again i dont know what to do with this thing its probably to big for my husband too,0
usually this wallet have great durability but my last one ripped apart in less than 3 months,1
i went to a yule ball and got tons of compliments im about a size 10 and i was able to pull the dress up without unzipping it totally didnt notice the zipper in back at first and it still fit snug the dress is a deep blue and green ombré effect much prettier than in the photo,2
this dress runs very small all over especially in the bust which is not my experience with three dots tops i normally wear a medium but ordered a large i should have ordered an extra large but am keeping the large because they are out of the extra large i could stand to lose a few pounds anyway i am 52 and the dress is longer than pictured but not too long i love the quality of this fabric which is mediumweight not too thin and falls in flattering folds i love the princess seams universally flattering i would buy this dress again only in the extralarge,2
great options and sturdy however clasps were hard to open and after they opened they wouldnt close securely again small opening for threading chain through had to remove oring to get a chain on,2
its very comfortable and so easy to see,2
love them no buttcrack action going on that thing is concealed for once youll spend more time working and less time pulling up your pants no need to wear pretty undies to make up for your fellow staff members having to observe your lady bitsbr you can also move really well in these hence why they are called yoga pants,2
cant find customer service access to discuss the matter first time used and a wheel fell off during our flight not right and should be replaced by manufacturer,1
the cloth is nice however im not sure what the blue spots are supposed to represent but they look like a pen leaked all over shipping took a long time awaiting another version disappointed,0
i ordered white flipflops to go under my wedding dress at my beach wedding at the end of the month and i got a white rubber part and a disgusting yellow brown thong part other than that the shoes seem to be sturdy for the price,0
great for when you dont want to do your hair one morning,2
does not look anything like picture will most likely return the item plus i do not think my wife will like the feel rough will see have been married for 47 yrs have a good idea what she will like more or less husband never really knows,1
overallbr i liked the quality and style of this jacket but it ran way too wide in the torson it looked nice from head on shots but from the side is enormousbr br fitbr i am 6ft 165 lbs with a trim build i normally wear medium size jackets and shirts yet this way way too wide it fit okay through the shoulders and sleeves but the torso and waist ballooned around me letting in all the cold air i ended up having my dad try it on who is 59 220 lbs has a pot belly and normally wears a large it fit him perfectlybr br materialbr although this is described as faux leather i do not think this has a leather appearance at all i actually prefer this polyurethane material the sherpa collar is soft and comfortable the stiching and zippers on the jacket are good quality the sherpa around the pockets do not actually line the pockets which would have been nice i appreciated the rib knit cuffs around the wrists overall if it fits you it will keep you warm i would recommend this for individuals who are thicker built,0
very nice and very see through,1
way too narrow could not even get started to put them on didnt seem to be designed to fit humanbr foot,0
had to return it its not windproof not for cold weather just a thin tight fabric to put over your head,0
liked the size,2
the main reason that i got this button up shirt was because of the color variation and lookbr br at first the shirt seemed great it fit perfectly but that is when i noticed a big problem the buttons are on the opposite side it is super annoying having to button it up and that is not where the problem ends the hole where the buttons go through seem to have another accidental hole every time i button up the shirt it goes right through the hole that its not supposed to go through and removing the button from there is always a pain also the quality of the shirt itself is okay not the best and not the worstbr br honestly if this shirt had the buttons and the button holes fixed i wouldnt mind using it at all i think this product deserves 3 out of 5 stars i hope this review helps you make an educated purchasing decision,1
i had to paint clear nail polish on them as they will turn my toes green eventually it came in a giant set and was very affordable would buy again,1
pockets are nice and big but when you close the robe they crisscross across the front of the crotch area nice robe but i will take off the pockets and possibly move them closer to the side seams who wants to have their cell phone in the pockets and have it hitting between your legs when walking,1
fits a little small but nice,1
beware we washed this in cold water as specified on the printed label and this was the outcome i have never seen anything like this before the actual tshirt material was ok but all the printing including the printed label came out all inside the washing machine as well as the other star war tshirts my son got for xmas were all messed up with the stuff that came out of this product it is like covid19 clothes infection all over the washing machine,0
cheap quality,1
newspaper dress looks okay on model but it looks cheap and does not fit as expected i will not buy this dress again thumbs down,0
very nice thanks,1
decent quality shoes they are a little long for my feet about what you would expect for the pricecolor was a little darker than the picture i bought the pink ones,2
odd uncomfortable fit and totally not soft enough,0
these pants run very small order one size up,0
not oblong as pic seems to show they are round okish,0
the collar was way too big looked stretched out and the print was off center,0
so far so good,2
look for something else,0
i use when its too cold outside to keep my face and head warm i hate having a cold nose,2
let me start by saying this shirt is very pretty the problem is the sizes are large i had ordered a 1012 us but the tag says 3xl ouch im going to send this one back and order an 810 us and also order it in white since i like it so much i have a hard time lifting my arms over my head to get shirts off so i love that this shirt has a zipper to loosen it for me my husband still has to help me unzip it though haha my only other complaint is the length of time it took to get to me i am spoiled by amazon prime 2 day so i was a little impatient with this one and saddened that i have to send the one i did receive back and wait even longer for one that fits br oh well first world probs,1
looks good but not polarized,1
it works,1
very saggy,0
fits well bottoms are full coverage im 115lbs 5ft 7in and purchased the small,2
the glue for th lining came apart to be fair it was sitting in my car on a 75 degree day the case snaps shut loudly and fast if i had something expensive or delicate in the case i would not get comfortable closing it,0
it looks like a striped potato sack with a tie around the waist and feels like a cheap scratchy curtain draped around the body there are a lot of wrinkles and it is very sheer its sad because the sewing is decent and the design is adorable but the cheap fabric they used ruins it,0
hated them,0
i was really hoping the support provided by this shaper would improve my round ligament pain which has been really severe throughout my pregnancy but even though im sure i ordered the correct size im 5234 and was 125 lbs prepregnancy and ordered the size b this thing was so tight and uncomfortable that i couldnt leave it on for more than an hour my 34bump34 felt crushed and it made my nausea and indigestion way worse by crushing my stomach having pregnancycaused indigestion is bad enough without feeling like youre wearing a tight band around your esophagus i think if i had tried wearing it for a whole day my round ligament pain would have been far worse off than normal due to all the pressure and if youre buying it just for looks i can honestly say i didnt look any different in the mirror while wearing it it really doesnt do anything i really see no benefit to this thing whatsoever,0
i have 3 issues with this ring listed from least to most important although 3 is all you really need to know besides dont buy itbr br 1 looks cheapbr looks and feels like the jewelry that you get out of the plastic eggs in the 25 cent grocery store gumball machinesbr br 2 poor fitbr the shape was poorly cast not symmetrical offround causes poor fit even with the right size too big in some places too small in othersbr br 3 uncomfortable painfull br while very thin from the top view it is very thick from the side it holds your fingers apart with your hand relaxed and if you try to close your fingers squeeze them back together the ring cuts into them like the blade of a dull knife potentially painfull with as little as a firm handshake but definately painful no matter what from the texturing on the band it starts to rub your skin raw after wearing it for just a few minutes doing nothing more than using your phone,0
poor quality,0
came on time and the quality of the material and print were excellent the only thing is the print came slanted on my shirt i received really dissapointed i ordered the wrong size so going to return and get a medium and hope its centered,1
very nice and comfortable,2
this is my second pair of this brand and the style but the quality and the materials of this pair is definitely not as high as my previous pair,1
compré este pantalón para el uso disten el trabajo y es super cómodo a un buen precio la tela es excelente en resumen un producto muy recomendado,2
these keep my feet warm even if they get wet,2
perfect for my doja cat mooo halloween costume fits my huge head just fine,2
great running shirts fit well and are super light weight highly recommend,2
i ordered this 1 size to big so it would fit baggy and it did just that i washed and rinsed in cold and dried on low it shrank down 2 sizes so disappointed the material is thin you will have to wear a cami or something under it make surw you order up 2 or 3 sizes so when its washed and dried it will still fit you,0
im not familiar how sizes work for belts as with regular clothes for example buying a pair of pants with a 36 inch waist one would select 36in the actual waste measurement so you need a longer belt to account for the overlap to fasten the buckle,1
i really wanted this sweater to fit i am 5 ft 7 size 2 this did not fit anything like the picture it was more like a bulky sweater than a dress this did not hang like the picture at all it was super soft and the color was beautiful but i knew i wold not be able to wear this as i wanted i returned it,1
i really liked the cut of the dress and the sizing is perfect however the fabric quality is where this really looses points i bought this to add to a more professional wardrobe but one that keeps a feminine touch it is totally not appropriate for this its so tight that it stretches across the bellybutton and highlights the venus mound even my hip bones were showcased by this dress the fabric didnt even feel like it was stretched its just the way it falls on the skin you best wear at least some heavy duty spanx under this because it does not have a nice smooth look like it does in the picture the fabric is somewhat thin which is what i suspect the cause it,1
i thought i would really love this shirt but the material is very clingy and definitely need to order up one to two sizes,0
a bit small though so i had to give it to my 9year old son he uses them on daily basis for 1 month and they are still intact,2
oh my gosh do i love these overalls i had been looking so hard for a pair of cute jean overalls and these are just wonderful the pictures i took do not so them justice at all they are so cute on the material is so comfortable for jeans and they stretch nicely i ordered my normal size and they fit me perfectly the only issue i had with them is that the straps are a little difficult to adjust but i got them eventually i just cant get over how happy i am with these and they were a decent price,2
too long and rolls up im 6 tall with a long torso size 1618 i purchased the xxl the fit around is good but the body of the shaper is too long and rolls up when i walk and sit i tried pulling my underwear over but the tail of the shaper stuck out the leg holes of my underwear plus the underwear on top just accentuated one of the lines the shaper was purchased to camouflage another thing to note is that the straps are very narrow its hard to tell in the photo exactly what is the shaper and what is the bra on the modelbr note i returned the items and was issued a full and prompt refund,0
it was good for the party i needed but the tail was matted and so was the hair on the ears probably only worth 10 but i was in a pinch,0
the fit of this turtleneck was fine but dont wear it for warmth or with a light colored bra as it becomes a bit seethru when stretched at the chest i think it would be fine as part of layering but on its own its a bit thin,1
xtremen stripe boxer brief 60 polyester and 32 cotton not very breathable in hot climates as i live in fl its hot here recommend one size up i normally wear a m size waist but went with a size lg and it fit perfect i have 32 inch waist they dont ride up at all in front so very comfortable for this reason in the crack they do ride up a little because of seam legs come up about mid thigh on leg length what i didnt like was where they put the seams in the butt crack valley and then wyed off down the back of the legs you feel these seams the most when sitting down they need to rethink the seams 3 stars out of 5,1
too ugly to wear in public im 40 and it made me feel like an old lady just looking at it,0
i love this dress i have it in blue and black and i really wanted this color which wa sout of stock in my size as expected it was too large in the size up so i returned this one,2
i like this unusual bracelet it is attractive and the different colors of the metal give it more versatility it bends easily so i can wear it loose or snugbr br the inside of the bracelet is smooth making it comfortable to wear on the outer surface even with all of the decorative triangles where the different types of metal meet there are no sharp areas that would snag my clothing i do wonder how long the bracelet will tolerate being bent to put on or take offbr br the bracelet is priced well in my opinion on is a nice unique piece to wear or to give as a gift,2
very soft dress little heavy only issue was the waist area was too big i should have gotten a large,2
so i mistakenly bought these for an international flight without the knowledge that vented face masks are not allowed on flights no biggie that was my mistake and does not impact my ratings however the filters are way too small and dont cover enough of the mask theyre about maybe 75 of the size of the mask and have the tendency to fold up inside itself the adjustable straps have the tendency to get tangled in my hair the nose bridge is pretty small and weak if you wear glasses this is an instant no theres no way to close that gap and seal the mask properly which is why i give it 2 stars,0
i have no idea how these have so many great reviews these are ugly rough and make you look and feel like a stuffed sausage these have to be the most unattractive and uncomfortable undies ive ever purchased,0
i thought someone was playing a joke on me the shirts come up just below my navel and i am an average 510 male got the 2xl also the pocket is hilariously small also there are seams that come up the sides of the torso which leave marks if you lay on your sidebr br on the plus side the material was thin and soft and would have been great for summer and sleeping if not for the above problemsbr br maybe i got the asian version these would fit untucked if you are maybe 58 or underbr br to sum up for the price these would be great if you add 4 inches to the torso length and added bigger sizes 3xl,0
runs big frumpy looking on if you are in larger size,0
i like these with elastic at the ankles they are soft and lightweight wash in cold and dry in a low heat dryer great house pants my wife does not like me to wear these out because you can see my package but i like these,2
to small,0
love the movie and the shirt very comfortable nice fit,2
i wanted to love this dress because its so light but weight it is super staticky sonic clings the side left seam also ripped the second wash,0
this hat is perfect for my 3 week old it is a little big but im glad hell have room to grow into it the fabric is so soft and stretchy its great quality and im very happy with my purchase,2
loved the style fit of the blouse,2
arrived on time as described,2
very good quality charms one didnt have a hole in the packs i opened so far,2
i expected these to be longer at the waist but they were average length and thin material,1
beautiful exactly as pictured,2
i was skeptical but they fit perfect and are very cozy im 63 and 250lbs i highly recommend them if youre wanting to get the clark pjs,2
loved this super sexy boyfriend loved it of course good material doesnt feel cheap i suggest you need this in your closet,2
we have had these flip flops for almost a year and they are pretty much done theyre really pretty and comfortable which is why they got so much use but if youre looking for longer wear flip flops look elsewhere,1
this item is lightweight and very breathable compared to a regular face masks which was my original purpose behind buying the item who ever took the product picture for this item worked some magic the image provided makes you believe that it will look like your face is chewbacca but in reality it looks more like a stretched out distorted version of him the mouth in my opinion are what made the image look so spot on compared to the actual item where the mouth is completely stretched and does not look at all like the image this product is provided with with that being said i still think it is an identifiable image and most people who see it will know it is chewy just dont go buying this item expecting it to look exactly like the product image because it will not look that good overall i am pleased with the item but i give it a 3 out of 5 for the misleading product image that will no doubt trick a few customers into buying it only to have them be disappointed please view my image for example when item is worn,1
this is a great layering piece i bought one in a different color last year and purchased another its quite a value i may end up with another before too long,2
these are excellent shoes unfortunately i scuffed my first pair up on the concrete i like them so much i am going to buy another set and hopefully find them in black as well these will be my new goto shoes for work,2
material not thick enough,1
sadly not worth the buy had to return them since they were falling apart,0
beautiful piece of jewelry for the price but cuff fell off right out of the package,0
this is a cute dress i liked it i thought it was flattering i thought the fit was pretty good i thought that it was unique and looked goodbr br the dress was relatively comfortable the fit was okay it wasnt too hot which for me is important since we live in floridabr br it wasnt too hard to clean i thought it seemed trendy it felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft it would work in a wide variety of settings,2
after gaining some weight my old bras even with extenders were feeling tight so i decided to size up these are very comfortable with the wide band which was what i was looking for ended up getting two more,2
this didnt fit and the seams are uncomfortable return was easy,0
the most adorable keychain so cute every time i reach into my purse to get my keys i smile thank you so much also the shipping was super fast and the packaging is very good,2
didnt fit right its like its too long for a toddlers head i tried it on 3 different kids and they all didnt seem to fit right i had to return these,0
small elastic sewn at the top of the band is tight and leaves a mark on my skin i purchased a size up hoping to avoid a tight fit otherwise they are nice,1
its ok just a bit small,1
this feels comfortable on finger but runs a bit small if you have large knuckles order at least half size bigger the whole ring does not change colors only the rim or edge does should come with color meanings and ring care card,1
it was not in linen as advertised and the embroidery was faked,0
this shirt is great at first very flattering good color and fits as expected however after a few washes the shirt has pills everywhere it makes the shirt look old and worn when i havent even had it for a year,1
not good if you try to put bills in they can fall out and if you put multiple dollars the wallet doesnt close very cheaply made returning mine and also not slim in your pants wallett is way to big,0
this is a very nice cute necklace which is a great way to jazz up a basic top or dress i dont care much for the packagingit looks really cheapbut the actual necklace is nice wore this today and got compliments this would be a nice treat for someone looking for an affordable indulgence during this pandemic,1
1 it stretches significantly after some time mine was tight now it flips over on my wrist when i drive my car or move my wrist around a lotbr 2 it discolors especially the whitebr 3 its very lose in the watch itself i dont trust holding my arm out the window when i drive my car and wont wear it when i ride my street bike afraid it will come offbr br i switched back to my silicone band its much less stretched much more secure and doesnt discolor this is definitely not a worthy applebrand your friends will know its a cheap copy,0
the small loop immediately after the buck broke in the first week of use its still usable looks good comfortable,1
the quality of the fabric was good enough for the price but the fit was way too large i normally wear a size 8us and i ordered an extra small and the dress was still falling off my body it gave no shape or flow sorry had to return it,0
super low cut ankle socks are my thing i buy and try so many that i feel knowledgeable in what to expect i was excited to try these i dont know if they actually sell these as a single pair of socks but one pair does not make sense in either to buy or as a testing item so my review is based on one pair of socks over course of one day rather than several no washingsbr br the plus side is that as soon as i put them on i knew all i really needed to know br br the sizing states it fits mens shoe sizes 6511 i am a female i often wear mens ankle socks that size wouldshould fit womens 8513 i happen to be a size 1011 in womens or 859 in mens the mid way point for these socks the range on this pair of socks is entirely too much and there isnt enough cotton for it to be a matter of shrinking down after washing and if so it needs to be stated as such they are quite long and i have big wide feet i could stretch them well beyond my foot and same in terms of width so whether male or female if you arent right at the larger end of this size spectrum you will likely find them too long no way it would be appropriate for a size 65br br and so i put socks on saw that the heel just dangles put on my sock and the sock over flows the top of my shoe loosely so so bad blegh feels weird looks weird being so loose will just cause friction in the shoes see my pics and it will truly tell all you need to know i cant attest to how they hold up because we just wont be getting that far if i do learn of anything new good or bad i will be sure to come back to update i keep up with my reviews and i hope this helped you today take care,0
broke the first day and had to return leather piece came out from the clasp,0
my favorite leggings so far super soft fits great and very comfortable,2
comfortable and soft fits at knee,2
true to color true to size i love it it has 17 card holding section a pouch for change and 5 sections for money receipt ect whatever you like putting there l the wallet is amazing thing about ordering another in a different color,2
i should have ordered half size smaller im sure they would be perfect,1
super cute comfortable and softbr i normally wear 775 and got size 68br it fit but if you are size 758 get one size bigger which is 810br br i havent washed them yet so will have to update the review when i washed but so far so goodbr it matches my barefoot dream blanket too br highly recommend,2
gloves are really nice but not so warm on a cold and windy day,1
i ordered a medium based on reviews that it runs small i normally wear a small i couldnt get the top to come down over my chest,0
interesting design unique look,1
well made but they dont fold up to go in your pocket and on a huge head they slide off,1
they run two sizes small,1
i am 5734 and 145 lbs so i opted for the medium and it fits perfectly the straps are completely adjustable to allow you to get it to fit perfectly and exactly how you like i am taller so i let mine out a little looser to get a couple inches of length and it fits perfectlybr br i couldnt believe the quality of the material for such a great price i am curvy so it is thick enough to hide underwear lines but airy enough to keep you cool and totally accentuates my shape this will be my go to summer festival dress for sure,2
watch is great but i owners manual and cant find one in line please send asap,1
i took the pendant put it on a slider added abr snap jewel this is a great item to own you can change your look for little br buy some,2
are they better at clothes manufacturing than photoshop good grief i sure hope so,1
cheap materialnot what i expected,0
i dont think its good quality and i bought 3 all at once because the reviews were good i regret purchasing them big time i should have spent the money on 1 good sweatshirt then 3 cheap ones their really awkward fitting the neck hole is small and the back of the sweatshirt goes up in the back a plus is they do look good so if you just want to buy it to look at it then this is the sweatshirt for you,0
i get compliments on these all the time i wore them around disney world for several days and somehow didnt get any blisters they fit perfect and they look adorable wish they had more colors,2
it was bigger than i expected and has a lot of sections for stuff but overall its ok and the graphics are really nice and detailed,2
its great but i feel like it should cost 5 less,2
love love love this is the perfect tote for our boat it holds everything and because of the sturdy rectangle shape it fits perfectly everywhere,2
the fabric is nice but not so much its weak seams when i received it part of the seam was broken already the chest pads are not at where they should be so they look weird when im wearing it they need to pay more attention to their qa other than that its an unbeatable price i would say,0
no regrets very satisfied,2
i am over the moon with these comfy green clogs i had been searching for some green clogs for a while and found these i love them wish they were somewhat cheaper in price but they are an awesome fit and comfy right out of the box no breakin needed,2
liked the dress color material but to big in the waist you may wear a belt to help i just hate belts and wayyyyyy to longbr im 57 170 athletic build and i purchased a large,1
not like it seems,0
bought this for my elderly father who is very picky he absolutely loves this shoe excellent buy,2
easy to hook on and comfy to wear,2
it works good its nice to know these are available,2
update i received several correspondences from the seller that i had hoped would be promising they asked for specific sizing etc in the end after all of that they just said try another of our designs i mean seriously ok sherlock thanks for referring me to captain obvious so i am taking away another star all that made me miss my return window and they literally offered no help at allbr br this bra is so close to being perfect its pretty well made and ticks all the boxes but one little problembr im a 36 dd and finding a bra that doesnt smoosh and make the girls look flat square or the dreaded uniboob is nearly impossible finding one that also is pretty feminine sexy and supportive forget ituntil thisalmostbr br prosbr very pretty and no itchy lacebr a wide back strap that is airy but gives a smooth contour and comfortable support it breathes but holds without cutting off your circulationbr shoulder straps do not dig inbr actual coverage that isnt so thick as to make you sweat but also doesnt let anyone know you are cold eitherbr reasonable pushup that is super comfybr br conbr there is only one the dreaded uniboob its not as bad as some bras create but it does make a slightly weird uniboob shape if the designers made the cups 12 further apart this bra would be the absolute best bra in the world and id buy 10 to make sure i always had one because they would sell out instantly the side support is too far forward and thus pushes the breasts together too much seriously just 1412 so it lines up under the armpit like it should wed have perfectionbr br this is so close to absolute perfection i hope they actually read these reviews and fix this issue it wouldnt be difficult to do perhaps its not as noticeable on smaller frames and cup sizes but if you are a c and up it most likely will be,0
this purse is large and quite heavy shame on me for not checking the weight before purchase,0
runs so small that ill have to give it to my daughter or tiny sisterinlaw its a nice fabric and the thickness is good but the sizing is for juniors or childrens not womens size at all,1
this shirt is comfortable but it looks like crap after one wear even before washing since it pills like crazy and once washed it looks like a hobo shirt but it is very comfortableyyou will end up not wearing it out of your house since it looks so shabby after washing and wearing this is one of oprahs favorite things for amazon this year but i guess oprah just buys a new one every week and then throws the older pilled ones away,0
i found they are a little small they are very warm which is good however doesnt have as much cushion as i expected so feel flat footed would not dare to take this outside in any type of snow or bad weather so just okbr br also a minor complaint but put a tag on each of shoe which i can feel when i walk can try to cut it but odd placement,1
i loved it thinking of ordering another for him and his sons to autograph,2
this thing is neat but it is a much lighter color than shown in the picture and its not as sturdy as some of the other nemesis cuffs also this particular one smells like an old musty basement hopefully the smell will fade before it falls apart from use still it does look coolbr br edit after 18 months of only occasional wear roughly twice a week the metal on the band has completely rusted through picture attached i wont be buying any more products from nemesis,0
they were super comfortable when i got them but no joke the padding was wore out within 6 times wearing them was pretty disappointed,1
there is no underwire boning or shaping in the chest area at all i am a 38d and no matter how much i adjusted the straps this tankini top made my breasts look gross the top itself fit like a glove around the back but the front offered zero support and made my breasts look like saggy shapeless pancakes im in my early thirties but this top made me feel much more matronly i bought it last minute with the intention of wearing it for a surprise getaway with my husband some women embrace their plus sized figure which is great i tend to hide the extra weight i gained after a pregnancy so im self conscious about wearing a swimsuit all together i chose this tankini top because of the empire waist and what looked like a flattering neckline so that i could highlight my best feature my breasts this top made me feel even worse about swimsuits and didnt make me feel confident at all if you have large breasts as most plus size girls do i do not recommend this top at all,0
instantly started shedding as soon as i took them out of the package there arent soles in this shoe its not even padded very uncomfortable and the fur is everywhere dont waste your money,0
these chukkas are beautifully crafted of superior materials but id have been better off ordering one half size larger than i normally order in fryes i should have sent the 105 size back for 11s but i figured they were a moccasin construction and would stretch more than regular boots i ended up using repeated applications of shoe stretching spray which has improved the comfort level considerably the bottom line is that these chukkas run small so id advise anyone ordering them to act accordingly,1
the watch has a small face i would not have bought it if i realized just how small it is i have the larger version right now that i bought 2 years ago and love it,1
not the material i was expecting,0
beware buying large sizes either as clothes or bras as they never are as large as they claim will be,0
fell apart in the wash cheap,0
great socks wish they had more wool in them for extra warmth but good anyway,2
this was too short even for a summer dress and it gapped in the burtons had to return,0
i hated the shoes because they transferred heat through the bottom my feat seared in burning feelings on the tennis court one try and returned,0
fit is rather small otherwise very cute,1
definitely will be returning i should have looked at reviews before i purchased this item it looks nothing like the picture,0
got a large and they fit like a small need to lose weight or needs extra stretch unfortunately cant wear at all bummer,1
too small and feels soooo cheap there was a knife mark on it too not worth the hassle to return it it went to goodwill,0
expected fleece lining to be thicker,1
im 5 ft tall 170lb and i got an xl it fit way to big,0
really narrow but awesome and great price,2
the glare and darkness of the lens will have you flailing your hands in front of you so you dont run into anythingbut you will look sexy doing it but seriously what do you expect theyre like 2 apiecebr br dont wear these when operating heavy vehicles or doing things that need handeye coordination,0
this mold warps when using with epoxy resin and will not lay flat you can see in the attached photo the leading edge is warped upwards about a millimeter or so there is another mold on amazon made out of pink silicone that works much better you just cant use that particular mold with uv resin,0
a little small they are wearing out a little sooner then expected,1
i only got 4 pieces and i think the rings are good for barbie doll tooooooo small,0
my daughter loves these pants she wears them every single day,2
the garment was a nice style and looked lovely but did not fit at all i ordered an xl and this fit was like an s or xsbr rw,1
pretty material shows it has sleeves and it did not come with sleeves was for a present and needed sleeves gift was ruined,0
this is very small you can put in your drivers license and a few creditdebit cards and thats about it i bought my husband another wallet the only thing i can say is that it was very inexpensive i guess you get what you pay for,1
took too long in shipping not exactly what i expected,1
lasted about two weeks,0
i normally wear size 10 and brought this in large since it gives it more of a swing but could probably have gone with a medium too im thinking love the cut fit quality and the pockets i will enjoy wearing it over the spring and summer monthswhether wearing it around the house or going out im sure,2
great fit wore it yesterday nice and snug just right,2
very disappointed with this purchase not only is the material of the pants very stiff although stretchy though the waist but terribly wrinkled from top to bottom i am 54 and 125 lbs and while the pants would have fit perfect with ankle boots the inseam completely bunches down the whole pant leg i chose the smallest size for my small figure but it truly isnt flattering or professional in the slightest will be returning these today,0
fits as expected and well made but the material is thick and not very soft at all kinda stiff and scratchy,1
but they went to good will not very cozy or soft and were too small,1
i was really excited to order this but it really disappointed me it feels like a semi stretchy cheap shower curtain and its beyond oversized i looked so stupid in this,0
sweatshirt is great nice and long just how i like it my only problem is its not offered with prime amazon why dont you sell these and offer prime,1
i dont like this shirt at all it was scratchy and tight around the arms it is long though if you wanted to wear with leggings also it is just a light shirt not anything like a jacket,0
la botella funciona limpia bien pero tienes que usar bastante producto el cepillo muy pequeño y la toalla es innecesaria por el precio puedes encontrar algo mejor,1
took forever to ship image does not have the clarity of what is shown in item description,1
absolutely adorablebr my only issue with these beauties was that the backs are frustrating and difficult to work with i finally just switched them out with some bell shaped silicone backs,2
fashionable and with great support i have plantar fasciitis and can wear these sandals for hours love the neutral coor with a faux print for added style goes with everything dresses jeans capris perfect for summer,2
bright sturdy durable,2
a little to tight for bracelet taking on and off to had charms,1
these socks might turn out to be fine because durability is a function of structure and materials used not just the thickness but visually the upper portions of the socks looked thinner than my prior athletic comfort socks from two known brands and the soles were not especially thick so i decided not to take the risk,1
bad,0
exactly as the other reviews state cheaply made but serves its purpose,2
looks nothing like the photo made of really cheap material,0
over all nice pendant and chain but the glass stone was full of scratches if i can get the stone out and replace it with another one i will be okay with it,0
i am happy with this purchase fits with room to spare which is exactly what i wanted without feeling big love the length its perfect for a woman wanting cover and freedom to move about with that feeling of immodesty would love to get more colors if made available,2
as others have mentioned they run small and definitely not size 911 i wear an 8 12 shoe us sizing and my heel will not fit all the way into the cushioned heel cup even after stretching and pulling i believe this is why several reviewers indicate the socks wear out or come apart quicklyits because your heel is not fitting in the cushioned heel cup instead part of the heel is sitting on the looser weave sock material that should be on the ankle area and not the heel im returning as they are too small they are also uncomfortable in the toe area due to the way they are sewn see photo this presses and rubs against the toe when wearing shoes,0
i read the reviews i ordered a size bigger as recommended big nope,0
perfect and warm until my dog are them haha,2
description states 3 pieces received only one piece only one chain in package wheres the other 2 pieces,0
the measurements are wrong the height is only about 15 inches the fabric designs are cute but the bags are not easy to use very small opening,1
the winner bank 200 pocket bank casino wallet works just as long as you follow the directions and do not fall into the temptation by using all your winnings sturdy and love the color i will rate this unit 5 stars,2
vets soft and comfortable light weight,2
they are cute not that hard to put on when you realize how to they are way bigger when you wear them and wear them in like two walking arounds the heal gets all wonky and you are slip sliding away within the shoe it sucks when you are trying to dance,0
keep in mind i didnt wash before putting onbr br 1st pair was fine 2nd pair has little holes in them 3rd was fine fourth seems fine,1
the necklace was too bulky for me and very hard to hook on with the loop closure returned,1
the quality of this product was very poor there were specks of metal in the detail of the arms and head which made it look like it was not finished i had bought this as a gift for my sister and had to quickly find something else at the mall to replace it i was so disappointed because the image was exactly what i wanted but the craftsmanship was not if it came like the picture it presented i would have given a great review i wonder what happened,0
nice color,2
they arrived on time well packaged i like the white instead of colors saves time sorting socks i will buy these again,2
tiny mouth kids not adults,0
the top part of these stretch which is nice but the calf area is not as stretchy i am larger than a small though so i was expecting them to run a little small on me i really like the fabric and the designs though i would like to see more colors,2
ok so they dont come off completely but my heel constantly feels like its going to slide out ive tried changing insoles using heel grips tying the laces with a runners knot no matter what my heel starts to lift out and if i do a calf stretch my heel will come out completely the size is perfect its just a poorly designed heel cup,1
the dress is very soft it was larger and longer than expected i was swimming in my normal size,0
fit great,2
beautiful lov it,2
i have small wrists and its still too short for me,1
dont waste your time or money the chains on both necklaces we broken when they arrived i rigged one back together i wore it for about an hour and my neck started to itch,0
perfecto,2
nice hat,2
very very small,0
nice dress great for spring and summer light weight and pretty,1
recommend purchase,2
the company and the product these are not stiff denim but a modern take on jeans the cut is great for my notsoslim buildnot for dad bods though,2
great quality the spring is very good would recommended,2
it was very difficult to get on and off him but was very cute on,1
even after 2 washes material is stiff pockets are shallow lenghth is good,1
just what i was looking for a great quality tank top,2
its a great compact walletand i like that i can put quite a few things in if there is a lot in the slots its hard to grab and bring out,2
been using this watch for a few months now i love the simple design,2
didnt like product overall,0
useless very small maybe good for a child,0
cute dress fairly tight in the top of you have larger bust very see through in the back which is a bummer im 55 and the length is just below the knee,1
not solid white like expected them to be,1
these will do but they are definitely for people with narrow skinny feet havent worn them yet as it rarely rains here but hopefully they hold up on the rain i have to wear really thin socks with them,1
used these in my wedding and they were not only beautiful but great quality,2
the shorts are cheaply made and arrived with a hole in the butt,0
they fit me woman and they are snug enough that i think fitting a man would be unlikely they are thick and stiff and not comfortable but am hoping these characteristics result in protecting my arms from cuts,1
actually very pretty and fit very comfortably,2
very good bar to work with so many different options happy that i purchased it,2
lacoste is my favorite clothing line good look and quality,2
very satisfied high quality watch band and easy to adjust,2
would like to return for refundyes,0
not asian fit they leave mark on my cheek after wearing meaning they sit on my cheek even i have picked the largest size onem,1
ill fitting returned,0
i am a motor head with lots of ignition keys these are perfect for quickly identifying the keys to my vespa which i have they would also be perfect for identifying the keys to my ferrari which i dont have hey my vespa is ferrari red,2
this shirt is awesome it fits me perfectly good price for a good quality shirt,2
good quality for the money beware it runs small,1
the bracelets are not as sturdy as they look to be it is two separate bracelets i bought these as a gift for someone whose name starts with this letter i would have ordered two more other letters but there was no t just got them so dont know if theyll hold up after a little wear and tear,1
i usually wear a s or m in joie so ordered the m i exchanged it for a l and could have gone to xl for a better fit nothing special or particularly flattering about it just a basic dress for running around doing errands,1
i like the way they look they fit correctly and they are comfortable not made for running i just wear them to do other parts of my workouts,1
it fit perfectly very comfortable very cozy keep me warm definitely recommend,2
granted the shipping was received less than a week but the product was not the same its heavy and bigger 1 12 in diameter the etching on the pendant is not as pronounced as the picture advertised,0
the best part is the chain which is nice and sturdy the opals are just glitter and resin as you can see in my pictures it is still adorable but not what was represented,1
awesome perfect for hunting hiking yardwork and pretty much anything else outdoor super versatile tons of pockets a couple im not sure what do with fits relaxedstraight i would recommend ordering a size up in case you need to fit a base layer not to mention belts better to have the extra room then the oppositebr br i highly recommend these quottactical pantsquot,2
this did not work the baby literally ripped it off it 2 seconds this was on as tight as possible,0
fit good and very comfortable,1
despite using the size guide this is too small i would go 2 sizes up or expect it to fit snug against the body,0
the fabric is cheap and unpleasant 100 polyester no hint on spandex thats claimed in the description workmanship is poor looks like it was done by unskilled seamstress student on the kitchen table crooked seams weird design looks awfully cheap homemade and ugly how can it cost 23 no answer best price 299,0
runs big,1
so not size accurate,0
this could have been good if it had an extra button on the shirt tails as it is the last button is placed too high and anyone that is slightly larger is going to be either adjusting their shirt often or wearing their pants very high to avoid the bottom front of the shirt from parting and showing belly i will likely return as it is too much hassle to add a button in the right location fit was adequate but workmanship and quality is lacking,0
they have a comfortable fit butbr they are not good on wet surfacesbr your foot will move around inside very easily making any sport or workout activities dangerousbr the strings are way too long,0
works very well on more loosely woven material the point isnt small enough or sharp enough for more dense it is easy to use very attractive,1
sorry but this is like wearing a tent also smells funny and has a sort of slick feeling that is so unnatural love the color but the product looks feels and seems made cheaply,0
warm and snug fitting,2
the upper part of the shirt is very wide the shirt shoulder tends to lowered the hip part is a bit narrow if you have broad shoulders and narrow hips it should fit you cloth is smooth lightweight material,2
this is good for feeling sexy under your clothes and posture however i dont like having to wear so many layers of tank tops and your back fat shows pouring over the top if its too tight,1
definitely buying more for working out couldnt ask for more great value,2
i only wear fit flops but this particular shoes letters fell off after about 2 months,2
i followed the advice of the fit guide and sadly the bras did not fit should have stuck with my original size do love the style and color though,1
the bows fell apart days after i got them i wish i could get a refund for this because i wasnt able to use it but one day,0
i dont wear them everyday but what times i have theyre vary comfortable fit as expected,2
i love thorlos sock for running but i ordered the low cut and received the mini they are much lower cut than the picture kinda disappointed in the inaccurate description,0
just the right size love it,2
i love it defiantly real and so beautiful but it is not sturdy it broke within a matter of 3 wells after buying it it was only warn maybe 4 times i am unsure how it broke not sure if it caught on something or not other than that it is beautiful,0
just received the item item was damaged left lens was removed from the frame frame is deformed just wasted 12 bucks for this,0
cheaply made not particularly warm seems incredibly flimsy,0
can be worn with or without a petticoat movable fabric so can be worn for swing dancing without popping seams comfortable and functional,2
super cute size up,2
daughter enjoyed her nice warm socks for christmas,2
quality not great but what you would expect for the price,1
these gloves keep hands very warm but the lining isnt well attached and tends to bunch up when trying to put the gloves on could be fabulous if the lining stayed put,1
runs big,0
seem very warm but run small im a 1012 pant and i ordered a large no stretch,1
third pair,2
love these i have a red and a blue one never wrinkles and washdry perfect always get compliments if you live where it is cold just pop a turtleneck under it,2
good quality fabric a little smaller than expected,2
really cutebut being a 1214 the large was too small gave it to my daughter who is a size 10 and it fit her perfectly,1
i really dislike all the straps wish id gotten a single strap version,1
the color and print were very nice but the fabric was off it appeared more like fabric one might use for curtains table cloths decorative pillows or a light upholstery fabric it certainly didnt feel like something youd want for textiles overall it was a wellmade garment,1
well made looks nice but not for a womans wrist stainless steel band looks good on an aluminum apple watch a brushed finish send it back unfortunately not the best for a small womans wrist had removed 4 links would recommend for men,1
great fit style and comfort have never found a pair of shoes that makes your feet sweat so much ew,1
shirt is very clingy and it was hot not a good choice,0
bought it for my fishing tripbr as you can see from photo i loaded sleeping bag pilowclothes thooth brush and jacket and it ripped offbr called and asked for replacement,0
wonderful,2
too small rolled down to ankles constatly child size,0
the way the neckline is sewn makes this sweater lay funny on your neck and also feels slightly funny,0
i got these before i realized they were jeans and not twill or khaki i have several pairs of total freedom pants and i find them very comfortable these jeans however are very tight fitting down past the knees then flare out in the bootcut style they may stretch with wear these are supposed to be medium length but the pair i have are very long i usually wear booties but these are too long and scrape the ground the fabric is nice but the style will take some getting used to,1
you would think a pair of shoes which cost 35 would at least have a zipper which works i dont expect leather or designer shoes at that price but the shoes should zip or one would think the zipper isnt even broken but its put in so badly one side of the shoe is literally sewn over the zipper as a result its impossible to unzip to get them on great craftmanship indeedbr going back and not reordering,0
nice shirts for the money,2
one of them tore up on the 1st day i was given a refund when i called it in the others seem to be holding up good but the product does run a bit small i am medium build 5 ft tall so should not have been an issue for a onesizefitsall product but this one stumped me,1
great little shirt but it had a nauseating smell that took several washes to get out,1
i ended up going back to just a regular hankerchief around my neck sure this thing stayed wet but it did not cool me off at all i wouldnt buy another one,0
flattering fit no bunching bulging or pinchingbr im 61 183lbs 41 around the breastsbr i love this top it is just a little see through but completely expected paired with the correct color bra it wouldnt be an issue to be worn alone but its lite enough ill wear a complimentary shirt or cami under itbr super cute,2
love these they are sturdy and look great i bought several packs this is a great buy,2
it was little tighter than i thought,1
it was too small for my head,1
clarks shoes and boots are the best quality around the mullen spice kneehigh boots fit great i have a very narrow foot but with thin socks they are very comfortable it is my understanding that these boots are great if you have fuller calves as you can adjust the buckles on the sidebr br frankly i only buy clarks for their quality comfort and looks they are on the expensive side but they last a very long time and still look great i would recommend that you put mink oil or some type of protectant on the boots for wet or snowy days,2
just what i was looking for,2
i bought more of these because i had a nice pair and thought i would add to them the new ones i got are 100 times cheaper poorly made poorly constructed my fist pair was much higher quality i dont recommend these,0
came very attractively packaged and was a very classylooking product but it was sized for a childs ear when wrapped around my ear the ear stud fell at least 12 inch too short of fastening and when i tried to straighten out the curve to make it longer it broke it isnt made of metal its made of some sort of enameled paste i stated this in the review request that i received after my purchase and the seller responded by stating that i failed to read the product description no where in the description does it state that this is for an unusually small ear i would give this 34no star34 if that were an option,0
i thought it was larger but this bracelet is nice for a young girl,1
love this gown its so soft and stretchy,2
no no and no these earrings are junk lets start from the cheap little burlap bag they come in to the really cheap gold fish hooks to the ginormous hole in one of them i understand that there are supposed to be artisan and not perfect but the parts that should be uniform are far from it the only good part about these earrings had they been made right and quality controlled is the actual woven basket design good size and the colors go well together these are a pass,0
this item might be fine for most but i returned my purchase cheap fabric wrong sizing and not for me,0
the material is very cheaply sewn with the same exact stitch and doesnt even stay on your face very well at all it continually tries to roll up on itself spend some money on a better one or if you are a bearded dude buy a wrapable gaiter,0
these glasses are real cool for costume parties thats about it,1
its exactly what youd expect fits right flexible not easily torn,2
i purchased these bras because they supposedly could fit someone with a bra size of 42f which is perfect for me upon receipt i was thoroughly disappointed of how small the bras were they could fit someone whos a dd possibly but not someone with a larger bust sadly these bras are being returned only good thing i found about these bras is you can remove the padding from the bra if you choose to,0
its cute but came all crunched up and misshapen promptly sent it back,0
poor quality waste of money it last only one or two weeks,0
fits a little loose but is great for that reason to layer over a button up,2
extremely see through and shows every crease used for a halloween winnie the pooh costume i had to wear maternity leggings underneath,0
its a little darker than shows in the picture but its a great size and i like it,2
the item came in time my expectations were met,2
very nice and lightweight appears to be fairly well made i am looking forward to wearing it soon,2
i bought black with stripes omg just buy these they are super flattering look amazing feel amazing im wearing these tomorrow to a night club this is very nyc where i live cant beat the price,2
original very different and elegant quality and a good weightwished the lume was brighter,2
it fits well its just cheap thin material,0
ok,2
purchased for my daughter she loves them she says they are warm very comfy soft and cute she gave them 5 out of 5 stars,2
nice frames got several compliments but the arm fell off after1 month i used 34crazy glue34 to put it back on and im still wearing them,1
colors faded after first wash havent worn it yet shrunk a lot might return,1
i had to return this item i purchased what i thought was purple rainbow when it arrived it looked like a dull pink rainbow the item itself was soft the colors just were not what i was looking for,0
my husband doesnt like these shorts too short not comfy,1
it takes a while to get used to all of this bags pockets and to decide what goes where but once one is past that stage this bag is highly satisfactory mine holds my dumb cell phone ipod touch ipad mini wallet sunglasses cards change keys eyeglass cleaner and assorted small odds and ends the color is a nice brown and the workmanship is excellent my only complaints are minor 1 the two parts of the main flaps magnetic catch are hard to match up and 2 the strap cant be adjusted short enough for me and at 6 feet im not a short person,2
terrible not soft and cozy,0
my daughter has been wearing these pajamas at least one a week for the past several months they are still in great shape they are a thin cotton fabric so they are perfectly breathable and comfortable we bought the same pajamas in a different color and we love them just as much,2
after 6 months outside return window the ring is falling apart the liquid that shows the 34mood34 has come out and it looks terrible,0
going by the measurements provided and xl should have been fitted but not tight in bust and upper back but this dress is uncomfortably tight in those areas not worth hassle of sending back in this covid 19 craziness so i have a dress i will probably never wear,1
great fit,2
looks nice and fits nice but already has fallen apart holes in both arms he wore the shirt once pretty good price until you consider its a one wear shirt disappointed is an understatement,0
returned did not meet my expectations,1
amazon recommended ordering a half size larger than normalbr my foot is professionally sized at 135 by the red wing shoe store staffbr i ordered a size 15 boot just to be safe as i prepared for an upcoming elk hunt right before my departure i discovered that the 15 was too small it took a size 16 boot to fit my size 135 foot,0
returned because i found organic fabric pjs at lower cost,1
love the gloves but touch screen feature does not work,1
these shoes are top of the line in quality they look great on my little guy who is starting to walk the sole is not big and clunky as to hinder his wobbly steps theyre a little tough to get on but they stay on and the best thing i paid only 20 for thembr br the little shoebox includes instructions parts and pieces to transform the box into a hippo a nice little diversionfor both of us,2
they were very comfortable at first then after a couple weeks noticed they werent supporting my arch as well,0
very stylish,2
greatly disappointed in this hat a misshapen mess hat fits extremely poorly dont waste you hard earned money,0
fit well and get lots ofbr compliments great price,2
dont understand why a blue lives matter charm and a white essential worker charm were included in this bunch seems deliberately unnecessary,1
i have worn these compression socks before i wear them because of swelling in my legs and feet will probably order more in future,2
the leather is nice but the zipper is the weak part of iti have now purchased two of these and both of them the zipper stitching has come apart after about 40 dayspast the amazon return policyonce the zipper doesnt shut it defeats the purpose of having the zipperback to my search for finding the optimal mans front pocket walleti am open for any suggestions,0
it just took long to get here but i ordered 2 they were nice,2
top seemed a little small for the bottom built in bra does not seem proportional to size i purchased a size xl i wear a us 12 and 34dd bottom fits well but seamed edge rollscurls up and again bra does not fit at all im going to remove the bra im pretty sure it will be a nicer fit without it,1
comfy shoe but during inspections noticed sloppy glue job and separation,0
beautyful sunglasses good quality hevy material love it,2
works great sturdy design and looks good,2
i have another set from soly hux exactly like these just different colors i got an xl and xxl the xl fit better so when i ordered these i got an xl and i literally cant pull them over my knee thighs they are tiny so disappointed not sure what the difference in the sizing is when they are the exact same product just different colors,0
the burgundy color of this bikini is so rich and flattering against my medium olive skin tone i love it they style of the top is unique and will compliment several different body types well the bottoms actually fit largely which is great i typically dont order bikini sets because im an xss on top and more like a m on the bottom but these bottoms fit like a medium so that was a win for me the only downside was that the breast padding came very wrinkled up and lumpy it did not smooth out so the chest looked really awkward there was no way to remove these pads like normal so i had to make a whole and replace them with others i had other than that lovely bathing suit at a fair price,2
thats what this shirt feels like the quality of the material is awful the ruffled and polka dots are cute but the material makes it bad the longer i have it on the more i dislike it its not proportional its too tight across the chest and too big around the stomach and too big above my breast thats why im the photo of the model wearing this shirt shes holding up one arm to lift the sagging materialbr im afraid im going to be embarrassed once im out wearing this around people because they will notice how cheap it is i guess the marketing industry makes a batch of these things sells the heck out of it then discontinues it i no longer want this shirt if its free its going back returning now i have to drive out of my way to take it back so upset,0
fabric is polyester feels cheap not a look or feel kids like also runs quite small disappointed,1
this item was pathetic its tibet not have it was deceived or picture it looks cheap and has molding material extra all over by the holes doesnt have the brand on the bag and has it randomly printed cheaply on the white circles for the handle gross dont buy,0
i returned this purse i found no fault with the purse other than it was made from a different material than appeared in the picture it simply was not the style i prefer but the purse was well made and others may find it perfectly suited for their taste,1
received zipper torn very unhappy,0
very thin,0
i liked the design of these pant and i will wear around the house but they are a tad tight,2
wanted to love these shorts look great but they are not stretchy at all no give they are not good lounge shorts wanted them for vacation due to the look also they do not breath well very hot if you want them for only the look i say get them for comfort seek another pair,1
glasses are ok,1
i like the designsstyle and the price but you get what you pay for the metal that holds ends of the material is cheap easy to bend and pulls out easily you have to be extremely careful with them 3 of them have broken,0
good material cat snagged it first 5 minutes medium weight ok value id get a second one odd zipper,2
cute comfy would purchase again,2
i did not like the way it looked on me neckline was too restricting and it was too long for me i am 52 ordered a smallbr nice quality soft material,1
1not cotton at allbr 2very flatbr 3too thinbr 4color is correctbr 5easy to washno color loss,1
my sisters loved their christmas presents,2
has no elasticity would not buy again,0
the pants were a little shorter than i expected as was the belt i normally wear a size 12 in pantsjeans so i ordered the xl but they were too tight on the butt and thigh a 2x may have worked better for me,1
small,1
arrived on time item as described comfortable for the price,2
its bulky thats the gist of it the small rings are nice and the big ring does exactly what it says it will but i just dont want to put the giant ring in my pocket so for a few days i used the small rings and left the big ring at home but the small ring doesnt provide the same functionality as the big ring a friend saw this and recommended an orbitkey and its in the mail in meantime i just bought a bolt and locknut at the hardware store and am using that instead may use this for something else in the future,1
comfy breathable great color washed well thank goodness for pockets too id buy it again in more colors and lengths,2
cheaply made,0
sound quality is okay the beanie is a bit tight,1
i tried to wash this because it came so smelly i ended it up throwing it out because the smell was so offensive and once i washed it the smell still wouldnt come out and i couldnt return it,0
they are nice socksbut do not come up to the knee they are supposed to be wider than regular socks but that isnt the case still a reasonable purchase,0
the material is cheap and feels super stiff i am 190lbs 61 athletic build i normally wear a 3434 these were tight in the waist so i returned for a 36 waist 32 length they were super long thats why i ordered the length a size down,1
comfortable,2
this was a gift and the recipient said it was much too small i will have to return it did not have enough slots to put credit cards and otherbr small inserts,0
good fit and a good value they are thin but the price and the fit make up for the thinness of the shirts will buy more,2
gonna return fit does not correspond to measurements listed nice fabric and grey color not sure a size up would fit size 2x tops usually fit loose on me but not this blouse very tight thru shoulders and bust,1
perfect for my minnie mouse costume,2
per image and description i thought they would be coral colored when i got them they are hot pink not what i wanted just beware of the colors,0
i loved the charm there isnt anything like it out there only issue is that after 2 12 months it started turning colors an orangecopper color on the part that fits on the bracelet and on the edges i love it and used it a while after it turned but after that i had to remove it because it doesnt look nice,1
proportionately the heel is much wider than the toe box if you need a wide toe box and have a normal heel width heel these shoes will be a bit snug in the front and will slip at the heel,1
love these tights,2
its cute but very thick material and runs small ended up returning it,1
funky fit pulls across shoulders going to have to return nice materialsoft funky fit,0
update the company contacted me and offered a refund or replacement i liked the hat so decided to give it another try its winter now so i wont have info on durability for a while but i appreciate the customer servicebr br the second time i used it the brim separated complete from the rest of the hat irreparable too bad because it was otherwise a nice hat just what i was looking for,0
love the zip up pockets,2
very poor quality look very cheap very thin dont buy,0
this hat was a lot of fun used it when the preschoolers came for halloween it does shed a lot but wasnt a big deal it got lots of compliments would recommend for a warm winter hat thats also lots of fun as a one piece you get a warm hat mittens that has a button closure and a zipper pocket for your valuables,2
i got this on a whim on an especially bad day at work first of all it arrived the day after i ordered it which was amazing second it is too cute much more detailed that expected and much larger as well love that i get to carry a bit of hermione with me everyday,2
opening flappy little hard to put in my foot,1
got this too for work for the warmer weather fairly cool despite it seeming like a thermal print fit true to size ordered a small,2
love them,2
huge not true to size at all,0
its so awkward fitting its huge i swear its for a man its a funky sorta style but im not a fan of the over big sweater vest look,0
dont know how theyll hold up due to the price but they are super cute and comfortable and the major bonus is the aviator style without the nose pieces that get stuck in your hair,2
hat is ok fit is smaller then expected pretty warmbr however after using it for the 2nd time one of the buttons broke offbr very disappointed and will think about returningbr br update 03052018 i reached out to the seller and inform them of the defect on the hat the seller responded quickly and offered me to purchase a 2nd hat for 12 the 2nd hat also had quality issues i would still recommend the hat as it is very warm,1
soft and silky but tight,2
great hat no problems or issues,2
hard to keep it lever on her chest,1
the leather stretches out to easily and my feet slide out of the toe of the sandal making uncomfortable to wear not worth the money i paid for them,1
the bracelet is beautiful as are all lizzy james bracelets it is a light coral color but it was shown and advertised as pink it is definitely not pink and im very disappointed about that,0
i wouldnt say this is cotton because it is very stiff it is big in the arms and body area but tight around the bottom wanted to return it but i have to pay shipping overseas not worth the hassle,0
i really like this dress im usually a medium but i got a large because i wanted an oversized look i like the fit for reference im 56 tall 155 lbs 36c in chest 30 waist 40 hips thick thighs and booty i took off one star because of the materialits so wrinkly and it doesnt have pockets not that i ever put anything in there but i just like dresses with pockets,2
so these are pretty comfortable and very light weight i have ankleplantar issues and have a little trouble with these if ive been walking around in them for a long time over all great shoes to wear around the house or on quick errands,2
good socks for the price,2
perfect fit,2
heel rub hurt,1
the fabric is too thin i would prefer not to wear a tank top under it especially in the summer,1
very thin clingy material,1
product is exactly as pictured arrived quickly adjustable affordable,1
as far as the arch support i cannot comment they are for a 2 year old so that is not an issue he love them,2
i didnt want to give it tone starflimsy material didnt like it at all i returned this item,0
cute but completely came apart after the first wash,0
a god price for nice warm hat,2
this item is absolutely beautiful quality made excellent color full soft i will purchase in another color this is an excellent purchase,2
too tight around ribs im a 36 incher but small breast this bra eould have looked sexy if my girls would have filled those cups in i had those pitiful gaps above breastbr so it was disappointing to mebr would recommend for large breasted galsbr for me onward to that perfect fit,1
i might need the test of these 3,2
why is no one talking about how long the freaking pants are or did i just get a whammy the shirt is snug the pants would fit someone whos at least 510 im 56 so what am i supposed to do idk about this outfit its just irregular on me,1
one of my brothers works outside year round he loves these pants true to size they are warm and waterproof the elastic in the waist provides some give they look nice not too bulky they move with you and have zippered pockets nice winter wear,2
the pants are made from a pleasant soft material there is both an inside and an outside fastener which helps with the fit the fabric pattern is at least a departure from denim good for variety the pockets are a good size and the length and waist are spot on for a 170 lb 5105 framebr br but slim fit didnt seem to come through in this pattern the pants legs remained 24 in surplus around the knees and calves so that meant not dress as claimed but rather casual to our taste,1
very poor quality plastic cheap i found the same style with better quality at the drug store for 599br disappointed and a waste of money just opened the box 5 min ago and threw them in the trashbr the lenses look horrible they reflect but you get this uneven shine from the lens that looks horriblebr dont buybr on the other hand it did come nicely packagedhahaha,0
i havent used it i bought it for rain i was going to return it cuz the quality is fairly cheap thin however i think i will keep it it has the features i want hood zipped front pockets great i think if you need more room order a size up,1
this couple tshirt is a gift to my friend and her husband the clothes size fit them well and they are satisfied with the clothes before i made the order i thought this couple shirt would come with the carton shown on the item page and as its a gift order the package should have been more well arranged,1
fits as i expected,2
these were the cheapest bracelets i have ever received on line they were made for a child maybe in elementary school i will not be buying from inblue again,0
this cardigan is much shorter than the picture shows about waist length not hip length fits ok but a bit tight and i cant wear it tied it looks really off if i try to tie it but it still looks good its really gorgeous and i love the sparkly beaded detail for reference im 5234 and im normally a size 14,1
not as pictured,0
most of the dress fits okay the sleeves are very long on me i am more irritated by the fact that i have searched high and low for a black and white striped dress and this is navy not even an almost black color it is straight navy they didnt even send me the wrong dress because a navy stripe isnt even listed as an option,1
the christmas tree eye glass holder pin is great i am wearing it all the time love it,2
i ordered 2 sizes larger and it was too small,0
dress was still really tight in the chest i am a 38d even after i ordered a size up as recommended by the reviews other than being way too tight to be comfortable it was a really cute dress,1
the tights are really nice the fabric and they way they looked on mebr buuuut and theres a huge butbr the bad thing is the belt per sebr because it was broken in the part where you spouse to closebr the fabric is broken and the piece is missing,0
good value good fit i wore them to zumba with a long shirt and they are fine horizontal stripe can make ones thighs look wider but i didnt care i appreciate the print,2
no more joskstap wedgiebr cup is too narrow,2
broke quicklywhile i know its 10 dollars it shouldnt break in 5 weeks also when it came in it had a scratch on the lens,1
i loved it but it is too big and very heavy it can not be wear as an unisex item,1
my son wore it two weeks and a link broke off dont waste your money,0
good service but these no show socks tend to slip off my foot and that is annoying,1
they ran small and are of poor quality,1
bought these leggings having seen other reviews mentioning they support the tummy they have a hold to them etc id give these leggings 5 stars for being buttery soft but as a plus sized girl there is not much hold and no tummy support like others mentioned they are fairly opaque but not completely i will still absolutely wear these but not out of the house will write an update after a couple of washes to see how they hold up,1
pretty color and flattering fit love the waist it helps camouflage the middle age menopausal roll,2
colors did exactly make the photos the green was actually blue instead,1
i enjoyed it,1
material cant use pockets even for a driver license andor a credit card because pockets are open from the bottom,0
fits as expected im a 1416 the quality is good for the price i will be buying swimsuits from this company in the future,2
very comfortable but not exactly what i imaginedhoped for a slight tapering into the knee are as pictured for a more classic sophisticated look these are not tapered at all and seem a bit boxy as a result these seem more matronly,1
dauther loved them,2
super cheap poor quality yes you get enough for a hundred pair you will need them all for your one pair,0
i did not realize the undergarment was built into the outfit if felt as though it was riding up my backside i would have rather it not been attached to the outfit maybe it would have fit better,0
the colors shown are not the colors of the print received the blue is more purplish rather than the light aqua color depicted so not appealing to my taste in colors also i ordered a large and the pictures show these tops to be sort of swing style so supposed to be loose and flows around the body not so quite snug and straight lines i cant wear this i thought ordering a large i could take it in if need be its really not large at allmore like medium and as i said not a swing style top not loose but snug around the waist,0
will not keep time correctly must reset weekly,0
just what i needed,2
i love these theyre non slip enough for my restaurant jobcomfy and bouncy with sexy straps to make them tight and little stash pockets are great love these comparable to the 180 goth boots you see at pretentious goth stores,2
very cheap earrings you get what you pay for,1
the material is not very soft as i would expect to start with another thing is that their sizes are not as you would think they are they are 12 sizes smaller im 510 185 lb male my regular size is xlbr but this disney size tshirt sizes are very misleading i knew about before hand thus i ordered xxl it fits good another thing is that sizes l xl and xxl sleeves are the same diameter around the shouldersbiceps keep that in mind if you think that that particular tshirt area will come larger accordingly to the size ordered it is not so i have ordered three sizes to test them out l xl xxl all the same in the arm sizebr i like them but i would never pay the regular price clearance price offer,1
these bralettes are really cute but extremely elasticy and basically compress you i am a 36b and ordered the xl which came with a label of xxl on the bralettes themselves and they are still a little too tight after taking the padding out theyre probably fine for things like yoga hiking climbing etc if youre trying to hold everything in but not comfortable enough for everyday wear,0
these are light and comfortable the colors are rich looking a nice cover up for cool weather they look good for dressed up or just wearing jeans,2
i bought it for my son 7 years old the size fit,2
it straight thug cop it,2
item doesnt look like the item pictured what so ever its not a terrible design but its absolutely not the same item as pictured the hole is also very small so it develops a lot of crusties,0
doesnt hang right,1
this keychain has a very nice saying it is very sweet the writing is very small but i was able to read it it is a good size not too big but not too small it comes in a very nice wooden box this makes a very nice gift for someone it is very sweet i would recommend it,2
just received today with a dot of the reflective covering missing and looks like its going to peel would like to replace but went and tried and said it doesnt allow returns,0
i like it but its too big it cant be adjusted,1
i needed black stretch jeans and it works but it is not the same quality of the old levis,1
these are adorable will definitely buy more,2
i have a combination washerdryer this cant be machine dried,0
the hat works very well my only complaint is that it doesnt hold its form as i would have hoped,2
really like belt and made well,2
bad quality,0
nose of glasses were not adjustable and sat too high on my face or hey would pinch my nose if i wore them lower glasses and frame were nice quality though,0
the only thing that disappointed me about these earrings is that the black outline is not as visible as it looks in this picture,1
cute jacket but its awfully short if youre a taller woman the body and sleeves were way too short for me it looked like a childs jacket too bad since it was a good weight and cute color,1
they are quite long,1
these are tiny and look much cheaper than they appear online,0
the colors are as vibrant as i hoped they would be but the material was a big letdown the material is far too thin to actually enjoy wearing this shirt so im probably going to give it away,1
i wore this romper for maybe an hour and the seams down both sides and the front came unsewed,0
like,2
i wish it was thicker,2
nice color but bad quality fabric,0
i am giving these slides 1 star only because they are waaaay to big i am returning them and will order a smaller size they seem to be mens size instead of womens,0
i bought this as an anonymous gift to be used for children in need by chold protective services i just hope it makes some tired upset and frightened kid feel like someone cares,1
little too tight in middle but great for lugi costume,1
extremely large and very long looked nothing like the photo,0
i sent this item back because of the color it isnt going to work for what i got it for background color is a navy blue with a floral print on top i needed a white background with i ordered from the same company and i kept that one because its what i needed the material is cotton i will be using the handkerchief that came with the bowtie and not the tie itself so i cant speak to how it fits,1
nice quality and price fits as expected,2
this is a cheap padded bra probably made in a sweat shop by children and the sizes are so far from norm maybe they are in dogdress sizesbr br this is where prime day shows its true colors its more like a garage sale of seconds chinese congoods and trash pulled from a dumpsterbr br never again amazon,0
they should be embarrassed i tried it on and the first thing i noticed was the lace up front was almost 2 inches shorter on one side then i was buttoning it and one of the button holders was breaking the stitching is the quality of work i was putting out as an 8 year old what a waste of time and money,0
if you live in an area that gets cold highly recommend it,2
this product was horrible but there was a gigantic crack on the big pearl and it looked a different from the photo here the crack does not go unnoticeable and the pearl is a lot bigger than its supposed to be the black string or poor quality theres tons of more quality pearl chokers than this,0
a little flimsy,1
nice and comfy,2
both faces go much slower than reality it loses about 20 minutes in a day i need to return it,0
the gold is fade no good,0
perfect,2
the umbrella pole was crushed in the middlenot a shipping deal obvious it happen beforebr when i lowered for the first time one spleen stuck out very dissatisfied,0
did not have the heft i would of expected with a nice watch also way to confusing to set,0
i guess i should learn my lesson consistently i am disappointed when ordering clothes from amazon online the reviews for this particular item are all over the board from too large to too small i ordered a size up large versus medium just to make sure they were comfortable but what they sent me was marked 4xx and the pants looked like i could put one of me in each leg there doesnt seem to be any quality standard at all the print on the pants i ordered was different than the ones i received too making it even more annoying needless to say these are going back,0
very cute and warm love it,2
bought these for my grandsons for christmas and they were very happy with them,2
way too tight to get on easily i bought 2 of the xls for me and the wife she cant get them on i have to force them on and its difficult but when on i love how they feel,1
for the price i guess these socks are ok dont be misled by the gray color on the bottom this is not cushion it is color onlybr for a buck a pair i suppose they are alright and i got what i paid for if youre used to having cushioned socks dont buy these i dont know how long they will last well see,1
came in much smaller size not even near closing i ordered for a 3434 waist it came at 3034 1034 from closing at the bottom of abdomen,0
the fabric looks really cheap like its just screen printed i dont have high hopes for this shirt,0
these are not extraordinary yoga pants or leggings and i certainly dont consider them to be trousers they are comfortable and i love that they have a usable pocket a deep one that will actually hold more than a tissue or a house key the product heading includes the word denim and there is no way these even come close to denim they do provide good coverage though no seethrough issues i like the sturdy waistband however they are a bit too much on the shinyh side for my tastes,1
i will say this shirt is soft cute and flattering the arms are comfy are not tight fitting which is usually an issue for me my only gripe is the picture does not show this as a crop top i do not want my belly showing br i normally wear a medium or large i purchased a large and it is very short br its too shortbr for reference i am 5 feet 150 pounds size 38 double d,1
chain was not nearly as long as appears on the mannequin,1
quality was not good,0
como lo esperaba lindo,2
the fit i like tshirts long i will be ordering more very soon,2
fit my oakleys perfectly,2
too flimsy and has weird dark spots shen washed,0
nice bag but ome of zipper not working returning,0
i loved how stylish this boot looked i purchased the color jade in a size 11 and when it arrived i was so hoping theyd fit i wear a size 11 but i have a bunion on one foot so if a shoe is too snug it bothers me well this boot was just a bit too snug for me to wear for long periods of time if you are an 11 wide i doubt these would work they are quite narrow unfortunately i had to send them back but i gave them 5 stars because theyre a 5 star boot,2
very thin fabric not great quality considering there are other leggings that cost the same that are way better,1
i bought this shirt because so many experienced thruhikers swear by columbia silver ridge lite well i can see why its comfortable lightweight and as an added bonus it looks nice in a casual or even business casual setting some buyers seem to complain that its bigger than they expected i think its well and generously cut but it isnt baggy or oversized on me i also love the feel of the material and it breathes well for me i havent experienced the clamminess that some reviewers have claimed i will buy more of these if and when theyre on sale,2
is it really that much extra labor and material to sew down the front side of the crotch panel why does hardly anyone do it also after only one delicate washing the thread is starting to fray i guess you get what you pay for,0
i loved the way it looked but i had to constantly take it off with work dishes pulling my hair and it would always pinch my skin hella cute but ouch,1
very pretty but run very small i wouldnt consider myself plus size but i am a size 9 in pants and would suggest getting a plus size in these if you dont want to feel like a sea cow stuck in a net,1
fabric is uncomfortable and not soft like advertised,0
love love love this bag coincidentally i live on oklahoma and a button on my bag says 34oklahoma national guard34,2
felt like a felt sweater that my daughter made in art class returned,0
the hat is great it is light and fits well i have a small head i am giving it 3 stars because i did not received it in the two days promised it took 4 days longer i wanted to take it on a trip i had planned but couldnt because of the late delivery,1
thin and cheaply made not what i expected,0
poor quality,1
really nice jacket and good quality but i will return it because it is way too big hopefully i can get it in a smaller size,0
be prepared for a mess when i opened the package black liquid everywhere my hands the floor inside of the packaging were all covered while using the product every time you push down on the sponge more black liquid sprays out the sides that being said my boots look better and the product did not stain my counters or hands,1
i was disappointed in the fit of these shoes i have purchased the easy spirit 360 in the past and loved them the 360 were out of stock in my size so i tried this not a good fit for my foot they were returned,0
firstly i love the socks color length fit softness and warmth however upon opening my pkg of my beautiful red socks and putting them on i found on the second sock a huge hole in the heel i am so dissapointed withbr these socks it took me forever to find a red pair of socks and was so happy when i found these i am 75 years old and can not get out to return them very unhappy and feel i wasted my money any chance of helping me,0
its a gorgeous and beautiful watch nicely packed for the price an exceptional buy except for only one thing my eyesight isnt that great the issue i had with this watch was the hour hand end where it points to the hours it has a white pointed arrow for me and a couple of other people it blends away into the dial area it would have been nice if the edges of the hour hand would have been painted black like the minute hand you can see that on the hour hand point the edge is raised maybe the edge should have been painted black like the minute hand,1
comfortable watch band and fits small wrist,2
i loved the shoe the heel and shoe shape is perfect the sheen on the silver is very elegant but no matter what kind of insoles and heel inserts i tried i could not get the shoe to stay on my foot it was not too large overall it just too sloppy and flip floppy i typically wear an 8 12 and this shoe was actually an eight so i didnt dare order a smaller size its a lovely shoe and exactly the look i wanted too bad i had to send it back,2
i think they are so large because of the loose fabric my grandson has never worn them and i gave them to him for christmas it is midjune he was disappointed that the charge on the lights dont last long,1
gets dirty easily,1
im allergic to nearly every metal except titanium i even react to things that are titanium plated i purchased these and have been wearing them for nearly a month without removing them and have had no issues highly recommended for anyone especially those who have sensitive skin like i do,2
the picture does not match the product beware its a straight cut around the waist no tailsbr i purchased a xxxl as a loose practice jersey and its tight im 62 240lbs so i figured a xxxl would do the trick i was wrongbr on the plus side it is well made,1
fits real nice very comfy im a usmc veteran with extremely bad feet not that socks in general make my feet feel better but i have noticed some improvement in comfort from rubbing etc wearing these socks i will most likely buy more if other colors become available have not worn them over an extended time frame to touch on durability but these seem to be reinforced in the right spots great intermediate sock all around,2
after 2 months of wearing the sandals one of the straps came off and rendered the sandals useless my teen daughter was very dissappointed that she had to trash them after such a short period of time,0
gave it a 3 star because sometimes it has to be reprogrammed with the correct time,1
i did a test with an oscilloscope to see how much voltage from power line hum 60 hz would be shunted to ground wearing these i carefully installed them according to directions and stood under fluorescent lights over a cement floor with thin vinyl tiles on it they seemed to reduce the voltage on my skin by some 20 or less bare feet reduce the voltage by 39 also i tested the resistance from the outside pad to the inside pad and it came in at 850000 ohms that is incredibly high for a product that is supposed to be shunting signals to ground i could do better with some copper wire and aluminum mesh screen they look great but i am honestly a little disappointed in the actual performance,0
nice design slim profile clean look 1 star because there are defects to the material of the bag where it looks like something dented scored the material reached out to manufacturer did not receive a solution stuck with bag that looks like it was used to cushion heavy objects,0
impossible to shorten with included tool no instructions except yhey may be here iin japaneese if you have a small wrisst plan on having a jewler adjust it,1
small side once cool water wash delicate shirt dry to damp shouldve been better quality to hold up past one wash to not shrunk,1
i was disappointed with this product i bought it wear while i got a tattoo and it barely stuck i kept have to mess with it because it wasnt holding in place wore it for less than 3 hours and i started having issues with it sticking within minutes of putting it on,0
love the fitcomfortable they look good and seem to be well madebut the minute i walked on my work floor with water not to happy about a skid resistant shoe that makes me tread lightlystill holding out that the 34new34 will wear off and i will be able to be safe at work,1
the socks are overly thick very warmbr too thick to fit in shoes or open toe birkenstocks and no goodbr in my ugg boots either im sorry i got them,1
this is a childs pant,0
its is not true to size i order a 2xl and it fit like a medium i couldnt even put my arms in it i didnt like the material i didnt return the item i gave it to my daughter it did fit her size medium body perfectly,0
i gave this ring as a gift its petite and beautiful i would not hesitate to order anotheri loved it,2
as with most things it looks better in the picture than it does in person that said it works well enough paired with some paisley leggings and it is cute enough and super comfortable,1
these were too long very thin but fit comfortably elsewhere more for lounging or sleeping than using to work out unfortunately because of the length,1
this blouse is made of nylon it is a horrible material and feels very unpleasant against skin and keep in mind that it is non returnable once you order it it is yours,0
love it,2
nice looking shirt my only complaint is that the neck opening is a bit snug for my liking i found myself tugging on it often,1
beautiful dress simply doesnt fit my body type well im 55 and this only goes to right above my ankles plus im small up top a d this has an extra 15 inches hanging off each side extra the material isnt stretchy so u need to stuff it somehow too bad,1
very small,0
not the same quality as previous purchases,1
nice hat but a little smaller then expected it does not fit my 16 year old,0
she loves them,2
these boots are great after trying sorel joan of arctic i decided to gives these a try they are so much less bulky and heavy much easier to walk in and better looking too,2
love it gave it away arms run really small,1
i have been wearing new balance for years great support for my issues i have always worn 95 and walking around the house during the trial they were great when actually out exercising my big toes are up against the end and im concerned about blisters something about the toe box on these is different from previous models most unfortunate everything else is perfect,1
the band broke after only wearing it a handful of times this is my second replacement and the same thing happened,0
doesnt fit my wifes foot quite right otherwise theyre nice,1
bad produc i return it but i never receve a new,0
yes nice,1
welp at least they fit,0
i feel like the set i got might be defective i got a size largewhich is what i normally go for in pants but the waist in the pants is so tiny that i imagine only a small child could fit in them though theyre the length for adults ive even tripled checked the tags to make sure theyre large because im so baffled by it theyre just ridiculously small in the waist i had to make use of the elastic for it to fit over one thigh and while my thighs for sure arent smallpear shaped it should be much much bigger than thatbr br if they are all this tiny i simply cant recommend this set other than them being too tiny for me to even try on the material does seem nice and it looks lovely based on what i got though i have to give it 1 star because no matter how lovely the design i cant make use of this set,0
these are great shorts but run a little large get next side down as the stretch while wearing have worn this brand for years and they are really good quality,2
ordered a large in the chest the space between the buttons spread a bit and it was comfortable in the shoulders it would be a bit more flattering if it was a bit less lose in the lower stomach area but this still looks nice and its a favorite of mine,2
it was cheap fabric cut so small the buttons didnt meet nothing like the picture,0
didnt fit like i was hoping,1
the dress is beautiful but it is way too small i ordered it a size larger than i normally wear assuming that it might run a little smaller but i cant even zip it all the way up,1
awkward fit snug on the bottom loose on the top and weird apron tie,0
the mask fits comfortably,2
the gloves are nicely made and priced right for being artificial pu polyurethane leather i only downrate them because of false advertising im usually better with the fineprint but in any case i hate being misled,1
the fabric of the product is not cotton i dont like the material,0
daddy got this for my granddaughter for christmas and she looks like a doll baby in it,2
the belt is nice the latch is not as smooth as other brands i have bought also the teeth that the buckle connects to do not start close enough to the end of the belt and leaves you with a lot of overhang,1
creases around the bottom of the blouse show its been ticken in and worn definitely not newsee pic 1br second pic shows marks usually from necklaces worn cheap metal leaves a greyish mark on whitebr will be returning second hand product,0
i love this shirt and thats why im not returning it even though the beading on the sleeves is poor and it was already missing a bead ill be wearing it under cardigans for work anyway im assuming if i exchange it ill eventually have the same issue however its comfortable and the fit is perfect,2
dont purchase if you wear a 105 mens shoe,0
es sintetica muy cara,1
wrong item was sent these are not bulldog socks and the quality is cheap,0
i really like the shoe fits great and goes with everything the heel is just right and the color is perfect no complaints here thank you,2
i was disappointed in the quality of this piece the beads dont look very good and it simply looks cheap to me i have not worn the piece and likely will put it in a garage sale or auction someday soon,0
the sweater is not that long at all it totally comes to my waist barely im not happy at all if i wanted a short sweater i would have ordered one,0
great,2
my son loves them,2
this is a wonderful set of two non rubber hypoallergenic medical grade silicone bands is terrific for men who get their hands dirty like my husband who is an aircraft mechanic instead of wearing his expensive wedding band to work he started wearing this band to work now he doesnt have to worry about scratching his ring or losing one of the diamonds from his wedding band while hes at work but its also very obvious that hes married whomever came up with this idea is brilliantits a great product that serves a great purpose my husband says its very comfortable tooits also perfect for men who play sports or are avid outdoors men and enjoy hunting hiking fishing jogging working in the yard or are in the construction business these are very practical wedding rings that you can wear comfortably without worrying about scratching or losing wonderful idea wonderful productbr br i purchased this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion,2
the glasses are not welded together properly they are welded in slag position and the part that goes on the ears one does not bend i brought two pairs this was my second and it was a bad make,0
cheap but super cute perfect for pictures,1
a little more yellow than gold but very well made and still pretty beware of the yellowthat being said i still like it enough to keep it,2
good size shirt like the 2 front pockets but materials a little rough light weighr but wish it was softer,1
these earrings are nice just too heavy,1
my item was eyewear should have been more protected,1
very cheap material i would not order this again and i would definitely not recommend it,0
doesnt fit very well,0
liked boot i have short legs so they didnt look good on me since they hit mid calf made calf look bigger since they were from england cost to much to send back my daughter wore them and she wears a 7 they were size 6br run a little big,1
these are my favorite leggings they are thick high waisted they do not roll down and they look a little more polished than plain leggings vi have them in 3 colors and plan to get 12 more,2
the white one is my favorite,2
ive purchase 2 pair i loved the first pair it felt like i was walking on clouds the second pair feels as though they were molded for someone elses feet they lean in to the sides its an uncomfortable fit but the first pair were great,2
this is a paperthin 70 rayon 30 linen shirt,0
pretty bracelet but does tarnish fast so dont get it wet,2
i have a friend who loves vintage she really gets into the hair the entire look etc i thought these would be fun pants to wear with her turns out i have to give them to her insteadbr br fabricbr the fabric in these is surprisingly nice it has the sleek feel of rayon in with the poly and the stretch is just rightbr br colorbr the color is a really pretty steel gray bluebr br stylebr the style is also really cute it looks fantastic with the vintage top that it is shown with in some of the photos these pants need to be worn a bit on the larger sidebr br zipperbr there is a zipper on the left sidebr br fitbr that is where this fails these pants need to be a bit on the larger side for them to fall properly i ordered a size 2x thinking that for a size 1416 misses us it would fit very well turns out i was wrong these are too small way too small as it turns out i had to give these to my friend who wears a size 1012 they work well on herbr br waistbr the elastic waist at the back helps when these pants fit properly they should be flowy and baggy not fittedbr br the bottom linebr these pants are really cute the fabric is nice and the style is pretty but they run way too smallbr br my ratingbr three stars these should not be running this small i am sad i could not keep these but glad they fit my friend who is nuts about vintage so not all is lost,1
recommended,2
itchy on skin during try on however seller accepted product back without issue,1
beautiful this product looks exactly as the image portrayed in the sample photo i know sometimes with products like these you can get something other than what you asked for but this band has met all my expectations it was easy to switch this onto my apple watch and it has more than enough holes in it for a variety of wrist sizes i have medium to large wrists and there is still plenty of room with the wrist band so if you have larger wrists dont hesitate with this watch i truly believe it will meet anyones needswants and it is a great product at a very affordable price,2
there was no reindeer on it it had abominable snow man,1
videoidf7089452983f93b1ec8061857e753242 this material is nothing like the first one i purchased not happy with material or fit,0
these are really inexpensive so perfectly fine as 34fun34 pair of shades but they feel clunky and like 10 glasses,1
pros good clamp and cup holder design but the swivel to adjust position is poorly thought out no resistance in it and when riding any bumps cause your beverage to turn and even fall out,0
i thought they would be bigger they look like they would break really easy,0
fit nice but material is very thin,1
beautiful very light on the ears and can be used to dress up or casual,2
the oil can needed to be a little larger to be a good prop with the costume when filled with water it leaked but i guess it was not supposed to be water tight,1
hoping they loosen up for now i will just wear thinner socks my military boots and all other shoes are 11s and fit fine these seem like a 10 34 but again hoping with some wear and thinner socks they will work update they did not loosen up so i will have to sell them to someone and look elsewhere for another pair,1
they are so tight even on the loosest notch they are way tighter than what a chain choker should be i couldnt even move my neck with it on,0
doesnt fit right around the eyes totally not comfortable poor quality,0
its a 1 day watch it stop working after 1 day,0
dress was lovely but after even reading the reviews and buying a larger size the dress would not fit over my chest areavery disappointed great price though,0
bought these for my girlfriend who has plantar fascitis and wide feet they fit her and now she can finally get the benefits of the great arch support i highly suggest the professional clog versus the xp if you have issues because the hard foot bed is what really aligns your body personally i have 2 pairsprefer the oiled version because they deter scuffs these ones are always scuffing and you have to scrub the marks off,2
i have very thin wrists and could not get a firm latch for my fitbit,1
its quality fits the price the leather is fairly thin but it looks good and is comfortable to wear,1
comfortable but for the price they wore out quickly,0
great slippers,2
havent really had much of a chance to use itbr wore it but temp didnt drop low enough to need to turn it onbr br the only issue i had was that the battery pocket feels awkward its in a normal pocket positionbr so if you have anything in your coat pocket utility vest or such it gets uncomfortable,0
i love this bag the pockets are great and can store all of my little stuff and it is very roomy and durable,2
love this flattering fit and fast shipping,2
really like this fits well warm and well made zipper seems good quality and like it wont break easily would buy again,2
i love how it shine but its made so big and some of the butterflies are upside down,1
greatmaterial,2
i love these sandals very comfortable and unique they make your feet look goooood and i got a size up from 8 and they are a perfect fit i have another pair in a different color on the way,2
too heavy bulky,0
i bought the recommended size based on the size chart and it was huge its also flimsy low quality fabric and there is no padding i am returning,0
the black and blue ones the design is on both sides the white one is two different colors on one side its black the other side looks faded its more of a light grey color if i had known i would not have brought these to much trouble to return these,1
the glasses work well and are light but the blue lenses are not as blue as in the picture they are more black with a slight hint of blue,1
loved this item perfect for a bach party i attended earlier this monthbr fits as expected lots of compliments,2
super comfortable,2
very small,0
i think you need a specifix body shape for this and mines not having it fit in the chest area the materials gold string bottoms are cheap looking,1
great for the price pieces themselves look cheap otherwise looks great good material,1
after few days the time had changed totally inaccurate built materials is crap not recommended to buy it even for one dollar,0
watch face is yellow but it should work for what i need it for,1
i dont know what they use to glue the glitter but normal walking causes the crocks to bend a little and the glitter comes off at the creases i expected better for the cost,1
i do not like style or material cheaply made unlike photos as advertised,0
i only received gold and silver and all the pieces werent there i only received a total of 8 keychains,0
they came very fast but when i received my item i was under the impression they were like the picture with dark lenses the one i ordered came with clear lenses i contacted the company and they immediately responded and were more then willing to replace the ones i had gotten unfortunately they were out of the ones i ordered with dark lenses but they were willing let me browse their store and pick another great business,1
iactually ordered an extra large thinking that i can always shrink it it is way too small,0
i bought this watch for my daughter she was sooooo happy with it she hasnt taken it off since i bought it for her it keeps perfect time looks sharp and classy its definately eye catching thanks for the great buy,2
pin head bent today during first use removing bracelet from marathon gsar,0
one cuff link works perfectly and one does not work at all i was successful in getting the broken link to hold some motion after violently shaking and spinning itbr br there is no option to speak to a custer service rep to replace the one broken cuff link but will update to five stars if i can replace,0
i use these as my everyday casual workout pant the texture is smooth and the pants are durable ive bought them before,2
im 208lbs 59 i got a 2x and the top fit like a extra small,0
i love it very much it is a great quality product very soft and very comfortable i love the selection of colors it has and beautiful design i am so happy with this purchase,2
cute socksquality poor disappointed went by reviewsjust bought themwashed once wore oncea hole already,0
perfect,2
these are really great and they fit true to size i will buy again,2
the tshirt itself is fine and appears to be of decent quality poor roaldy looks like he had a heck of a rough night though very washed out and not at all as pictured on the product page ill still wear it but im pretty bummed,0
i loved the look and feel of these slippers nice classic high end appearance and very comfortable to wear unfortunately they run so small im a solid size 9 us womens shoe and even jammed into the 910 size of these slippers had my heel hanging off the back go up a size or even two in these slippers,1
color is not as vibrant in person,1
nice color,2
i am happy this material doesnt make it worse for night hot flashes sleep very well and happy with it,2
excellent glove for price i ordered a medium and it fits but it is snug i might order the league if i had known shipping was fast,2
too small acrid mid section,1
wow is all i can say about this tunic type top i love the comfortable fit and soft fabric the roomy design makes it easy to throw on and go shopping or the beach i love to add leggings underneath because the length is just right the pockets can hold a phone i like the give of the fabric because it makes it comfortable to wear overall if i could give this more than 5 stars i would it is a very flattering top for a larger girl like myself,2
septum piercings were perfect everyone thought they were real,2
sadly these were too small i think the sizing was off order 1 or 2 sizes larger than you normally wear returning,0
holesbr holes everywherebig ones small onesbr cant return because window closedbr do not buy,0
i have several pairs of sleepyhead pjs i bought a year ago very comfortable and they have slit side pockets which are greatthis new pair has more spandex not as soft and no pocketsdisappointingthey feel a little cheapthey were the flamingo pjs3,1
the gloves felt nice but im concerned about some extra protection while riding ny tafficcabs dont really help the riding,1
very pretty color,2
these shoes were for my daughter for her basketball season they held up well and were comfortable for her she wears an 11 in womens but we ordered a size 9 in the mens her foot isnt as wide as most guys shoes so shes found that works for her instead of a 95 basketball shoes in womens size 11 has a very limited selection so mens it is,2
lindos,2
these were a gift from my daughter to her boyfriend unfortunately after just a week of wearing both of them cane untied and had to be redone they are not secured very well they both like the style they probably should have a different knot or clasp,1
i like the shirt overall but it is too small i went up a size die to being a bit larger in chest and it is still tight heavens if i put on a couple pounds this thing would rip it is nice length but tight across the breast area i probably needed 2 sizes larger but how would one know when its not a true to size item i probably wont be wearing this now as i dont think i could comfortable swing my golf clubs without this pulling too much,1
not enough dye to dye the shoes,0
i got these for ourselves and our kids for playing outside in the winter and being pulled in the sled they are nice and warm and comfortable they are exactly what i was looking for at a reasonable price,2
the screw that hold the legs to the frame get loose very fast and no matter how many times you tighten them in a few days they start to get loose in a few days and if you dont pay attention then you will end with a lost screwand one of the legs falling apart,1
looked a little cheap to be used for bridal shower gift,1
the band is uncomfortable and very cheaply made yes more cheaply made that i expect given its cheap price it is already peeling up on the edges,0
i ordered 2 sixes too big so i could taylor to my body i wear a 2x and i ordered a 4x this will not fit me even ordering 2 sizes larger i ordered thinking it was 100 cotton but it is 100 rayon cheep black cloth with a printed pattern of flowers the sleeves are tiny bust will not fit a 38b im disapointed but knew better made in china,0
i bought a size up and they are way too narrow even if i bought two sizes up they still would be too narrow very disappointed,0
its just case for great price better looking than rinowa,2
no compression at all i ordered medium hoping they would be tighter and unfortunately while the black one fit me the way i like tank tops to fit long and comfy the grey one is not the same length and keeps pulling itself up over my stomach which is very upsettingbr ill probably give away the grey one and if the blue doesnt fit ill do the same with thatbr will be looking elsewhere for the compression i want,1
once you put them on it looks like you are wearing yellow socks with balloons,0
not as cushy or supportive as crocs but cost less too has some arch support prefer crocs but needed beach flip flop so itll do,2
they are lightweight plastic with binder hoops they are cute but i havent worn my crocs with them on yet i hope they last,1
great for the money,2
fit was as expected very loose fitting and comfortable this did not shrink after going through the wash and dryer great quality and color,2
they just barely fit i decided to keep them but be warned they are cut on the smallish side if you like heavy socks stay away from these,1
fun cotton sock packbr for business or casual wearbr nice variety setbr would recommend,2
this is not a warm jacket at all the sleeves are to long for the size i ordered you cant wear gloves with it comfortable because the sleeves are to skinny and i have average arms i am disappointed with the purchase the collar comes up to high on the jacket it touches your ears but not long enough to cover and it wont fold down disappointed,0
i returned this item i scrutinized many wallets looking for a close replacement for my worn one i wanted a small zippered case large enough to hold several credit cards license and cash which i fold twice i selected this based on dimensions but found it to be stiff and bulky also the zipper just did not glide easily did not suit my tastes,0
bought this a while ago and wanted it to work so much it is cute looking lite weight and figured for the price i would try it wish i didnt mine came with a small defective on the seem and can see it wouldnt last so i returned it i didnt order a replacement due to the slots for the cards were tight so tight it was hard to get my card out when i tested it plus if i was to put all of my cards which are just the basics with my drivers license it would be to thickbr not sure how coins and dollar bills would fit in it so it was a no go and didnt reorder,0
it was not flattering because it didnt lay flat from the bust down in fact it poofed out making me look bigger very disappointed because the cutout and bodice are cute and it had potential,0
im slowly growing a collection of lapel pinsbrooches im really into them right now and i love the idea of wearing a few grouped together with fallwinter outfits kind of a sophisticated take on geek chic this pin fits the bill nicely yes the quality could be better but its not something ill wear all the time so it doesnt bother me the price for it could be lower but if it will work for a certain outfit its not a bad buy the overall construction is good and the clasp stays in place well im not sure if its supposed to be this way but the finish has come off the edges of the pin it looks slightly distressed but nothing anyone will pay attention to the colors are richly done the detailing is good not great but good enough i know its a mens lapel brooch but this will suit my needs nicely,1
fit was perfect i love the shoes super comfortable,2
these are so greatits all i wear in the summer they have great arch support for my plantar fasciitis i highly recommend them,2
comfortable but it is very light and seethrough,1
i am using it but not my favorite purse,1
i have the coffee colored pair which have a short interior lining i like the color and lining fine what i dont like is that these are like culottes in length for my 59 frame if id read the reviews ahead i might have noticed that some shorter reviewers than i said the length just hit at their ankles the picture shows a model in a longlooking length and i guess the model is short unlike me i find that if i pull the pants down a bit and wear them with boots they just barely pass for me as acceptable tall peeps beware unless you like short pants,1
kinda big rolly because of the steel toe,1
this is a beautiful wrap but unfortunately was not the color we expected we ordered the pink and what we got while very pretty did not have much pink in it at all but instead had more browns and blacks the color is not what was pictured we thought this may have been a packaging error so we ordered an exchange but received the same colored shawlbr fortunately it did match the outfit my mother planned on wearing it with so she was still able to use it,1
this product is trash broke after one week of use,0
love the top not too fond of the bottom,1
1 this purse is too big yet too small the overall purse is larger than described but the main purse opening is so narrow you can hardly fit anything inside itbr 2 all the zippers are very difficult to open and impossible using only one hand they are stiff and get stuck half waybr 3 the front large opening is useless no slots for cards or pockets of any kind just a zippered flapbr 4 the purse itself does not look feel or smell like leatherbr br i have had cheaper leather purses that were much nicer and user friendly,0
disliked everything i was i would have listened to the other reviews matieral is cheap and crappie i probably could of found a better one at the dollar store 38c fit around my bust line but the cups are to small makes your boobs look deformed also the strap in the front are way loose,0
this shirt definitely runs big but i was able to style it with a cute pair of denim jeans booties arms were still really loose but i made it work for church on new year it is thinner than id like also since it wasnt completely true to size i probably wouldnt purchase again,1
cute the only reason i have it 4 stars is the arms are long i had to cuff them washed and dryer still looked good,2
i bought these shoes for my 7 year old he loved the look and i liked the soles we received them 2 days ago he wore them to camp which was indoors both days so no outside hardcore playing the shoes are already tearing at the seam and they are fraying on the strap very disappointed,0
very durable and plenty of storage,2
i ordered a l because everyone says order up but i think the zippers made the sweater look hippy only because i ordered the wrong size im a m and i think i should have ordered a medium returned because the collar of the sweater is lacking and made the whole thing look drab,0
this is a cheap ring so its exactly what this is warning it runs small so go up a size since there are no half sizes available i bought two rings in different sizes one for me and one for my wife and neither fit on the finger we wanted it to even though we bought our right sizes,1
not like pictured cant even tell that it is green it is a very pale green you cant even tell it is green it is a pretty ring though,1
love the color,2
runs a bit small and is definitely cheaply made but not a bad option for a quick cheap purchase,1
the fabric is very thin and bot the best quality threads are falling apart br the top fits really fit but the skirt fits fine just seems like the sizing is off,0
surprise me beautiful,2
still trying to set the time,1
nice shirt but the white is very translucent you will need another shirt or cami to wear underneath which defeats the purpose of wearing as a sun shirt during hot weather riding,1
my husband really likes this watch it came so well packed,2
too small,1
these were almost orange vs gold the strap was also way to big and so i wasnt able to use them i needed an extra hole in the strap,1
my wifes reviewbr i would do less for star rating but it is a somewhat flattering swimming suit heres why i gave it 3 starsbr 1 the fabric seemed to be good quality compared to everything out therebr 2 i loved the thicker strap it was comfortable on my shoulders and i didnt feel like id need to keep adjusting or pulling them back upbr 3 the rouched fabric hid a bit of mom tummy bulge in the upper areasbr but heres why i sent it backbr 1 i am only 50 tall with saggy c breast fed three kids boobs average to smaller torso length it was way too tight in length when i tried it on after 10 seconds it was giving me uncomfortable pain in the side leghip creasesbr 2 if you have boobs at all or even worse some mom sag in your boobs they will not stay in the cups they fall down so you have double boobs the seam cuts into your breast and literally you miraculously have two boobs on each side plus the insertabke cup pads were a hilarious shape i also had pointy boobs four pointy saggy boobs totally not what you want in a swimming suit br 3 i wish the rouching would have gone down lower most moms who have a bit of baby belly and want to hide it with rouching dont have problem areas in the upper torso its the lower stomach area so if it had gone lower it would have made much more sense br 4 the sizing is way off i sized up because of other reviews and it was still a bit too tight for my likingbr overall the price is good but i dont think it matters on pricewhether you paid 20 or 200 if it doesnt fit or isnt comfortable you dont want to wear it,1
new but too small,0
returned ran small by at least a full size,1
the material is nice however this is far too small i ordered the xl in the ivory which i didnt have too high hopes for when i opened the package i was delightfully surprised to find the construction of the dress to be good the stitching seamed strong and the material was soft and silkybr br i wish this dress fit because it just looked and felt so beautiful here are my measurements b4634 w3834 h4834 and again i ordered the xl it was tight across the chest there are certain things that i can try on and say 34yeah if i lost some weight this would fit34 but sadly this is not one of those things i am trying to lose weight but even at a more healthy size i dont get a sense that this will fitbr br finally even if it fit on the chest this dress was really short im 6034 and this hit just below my buttocks id need to wear bloomers with this to not be insulting tall people bewarebr br if only i could get the pattern for this dress then i could sew one that would fit oh wellbr br overall i would recommend this dress for shorter folks who are small in the breast theyll look gorgeous and i think this dress will last in a brief glance the material and construction looked solid,1
a little smaller than i thought but actually ended up being better smaller,2
great sock for walking no blisters or hot spots,2
this products is misrepresented the size of these underwear are as small as boys underwear rather than men sized the materials are not what they have listed on the package they state that its 90 nylon and 10 spandex but i beg to differ i own another brand of underwear and they have the exact blend and amounts of fabric and this product is totally different than the other product there is no way this is the same fabric and it has a totally different feel to it i believe they need to revise what they are disclosing for materials and get the sizes correct or at least put a sizing chart to show the buyer exactly for what waist size it represents,0
it was a bit flimsy wish it was enforced better it will work well for the costume so no need or fuss about a new one,0
great price and great lee jeans im very happy with quality jeans for 20 out the door other ones with lighter colors were like 2045 bucks but i found a nice one for 20,2
i hate feel of it inside and out not what i expected never used or seen one with card slots like this not so easy access the best and only good thing about the wallet to me is the id slots theres one on each end which is awesome but i hate the card holder i guess i have to stop being cheap and buy exactly what i want,1
got this for my ginger bearded teacher brother who normally wears a medium but this was rather small he said he would try to stretch it out and wear it but i doubt he will the design was great and the shirt was nice but i would order at least one size up if not two from the size you normally wear it is going to shrink in the washer and dryer for surebr really wish it would have been something he could have worn,1
these were cheaply made and sizes are why smaller than expected,0
this dress fits as expected im 510 160lbs and wear a size 8 the large fits nicely in this dress i do not however like the fabric its polyester and not breathable at all the thicker fabric makes me hot when i wear the dress it hits above the knee and i can dress it up with jewelry for a more puttogether look for the office overall its a pretty blahlooking nonremarkable dress with not so fun to wear fabric,1
i am 60 215 lbs and normally wear an xl tshirt i could barely get these on they were way too small and the sleeves barely got past my shoulder if your petite they might work for you,1
cutebr warmbr easy to put onbr grandson likes them,2
the material was very thin not what i expected,1
i bought these for my sister and she is 4 11 and weighs about 120 lbs nopeshe couldnt pull them up pass her calf,0
they are made well but much too heavy will have to return them,0
these shoes fit nicely feel comfortable,2
came just a described and very pretty,2
definitely great for everyday use,2
i didnt care for the feel of these jeans they were too clingy on my legs i prefer the fabric of pants to hang nicely not grab onto me perhaps the cut of this style was too narrow for my legs as i own other jeans with a touch of spandex that dont cling at all,1
less sturdy than it looks clasp doesnt stay closed,0
i am not pierced and not going to get pierced either if you made another version about a third smaller that can be worn without the stud,2
cute but runs super large im 55 average build and the medium was huge on me and super long,0
the bracket appears to be well made its a good size and seems durable the problem is i cannot open it i read the instructions before ordering and it seemed simple enough but my hands are not strong enough apparently to pull and push it open maybe they should add a video so that others can watch and determine if its a good purchase decision,0
over time they will fade,1
great value,2
soft and comfortable,2
i really like these joggers but mine arrived with a large hole on them that i did not find until they had already been through the wash before the first time i wore them,0
if you are plus size do not buy if they had it in 5x it may have fit but as someone who wears a 3x loosely it was a huge nope pissed away money on this bc they didnt even get with me on returning it at all so i gave it away,0
cute but way too small,0
ive been using spring facial hair removers for many years and these are not the real deal the spring is not pliable and does grab peachfuzz hair i do not think the spring is ss do not buy this brand the price was cheap for a reason this particular spring stick does not work at all,0
cheap material bought three shirts just like this for me and my 2 daughters all 3 shirts thread come loose under the arms and down the seams very cheaply put together,0
good for a purse drape,1
great shirt but i might have gotten fatter,2
too small for adukts,0
zipper was zipped unaligned and broken,0
the brand bzees is fairly new to me but im sold on them i had plantar fasciitis some years ago and i dont want it to return so im careful with my shoes they must have good arch support these fit the bill they are comfortable and cute i now have several pairs and they all fit the same no difference between styles i bought a size larger in these boots because i wear a fairly heavy sock in the winter bzees promises to be my favorite and most purchased shoe brand machine washable is just a fantastic bonus highly recommend,2
i suppose its my fault for not reading all the details about the item but when i tried this briefs on i noticed my friend was sticking through the sock thing i was originally planning to wear these with my running shorts i wanted something moddest to hold everything snuggly underneath my short and thin running shorts needless to say i wont be wearing these anytime soon under my clothes in public,1
fits wonderfully,2
i ordered a mans and womens one for a themed party they are just ok they are a thinner material and fit rather snugly the 3x i ordered is probably more of a 2x my medium is ok but a little tight in the shoulders served its purpose for the price though,1
for the price they are fine as a 3rd pair of shoes for the gym or dog walking the toe area is wide and i have a wider foot very little cushioning on sole which is why i couldnt wear them all day,1
extremely to small an extra large fits like a smallmedium,0
these shoes are perfect for me my feet tend to be on the slightly wide size so 10 fits like a 10 wide which is what i was hoping,2
excellent box nicely finished,2
this jacket will keep you as warm as a tshirt would it almost zaps warmth idk how it does it but it does i bought as a fall jacket knowing it couldnt survive winter but dang it doesnt keep you warm at allbr br it fits tight i wear a small but got a medium to layer underneath with yet it is still tight with only one sweater underneath is oddly short too i got the longer version with the underlayer provided and it still comes to right at the top of my hips had wanted it longer br br overall its waaay overpriced it is made of crud materials and somehow sucks warmth out of you so it is not even wearable as a jacket in literally any weather though maybe itll keep you cool in summeri have yet to try this but heybr br please heed me and skip this as it is only coollooking off uncomfortable on and youll end up staring at it in mixed longing and fury as it hangs in your closet,0
nice shirt but the extralarge is actually somewhere between a normal large and extra large if i had to buy another shirt from this supplier id buy a size larger than my actual size,1
the band is very comfortable but there are a few challenges with itbr br the magnets both popped off after 1 month of use making the band no longer usablebr im about 140lb and the band is actually too big for me its maybe a 2 cms short of being tight on my riskbr due to the design when you wash your hands water gets trapped inside the band and slowly leaks out afterwards,0
the packaging had on it written warning that this item contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancerbirthreproductive harm,0
extremely disappointed you cannot read the words on the bracelet without a magnifying glass and the band feels cheap so disappointed im throwing it away,0
10 individual nose rings in their own bag not flexible hard to open i was scared that i would break one cute but wont work for me,0
the fabric is really stiff and hard i thought after i washed it with some fabric softener it would help but i it didnt i really only purchased it for when we go camping do its not a huge deal for me the colors on the graphic are vibrant it fits true to size,1
i received them broken im very upset,0
not as described at all it was more of a think felt material very stiff im usually 1416 and ordered an 2xl and didnt fit runs very small,0
these earrings look nice in the picture but when i wear them they seem too big for my liking i ended up returning them and order a slightly different style i wish they had a picture of the earrings on a model to show their actual size and style,0
i normally wear a 2x in mens tshirts so i ordered a 2x it was way too small it didnt stretch at all and didnt even begin to cover my chest area i ended up having to return it,0
the size and cut of the amethyst were perfect for me i never wear jewelry too large was disappointed with the color of the stone against the skin it is hard to make out exactly what the color of the stone is supposed to be when paired with white fabric the stone seems to have a pale olivegray color i guess the disappointment comes in thinking the stone would be a little more green or brighter may research to see if other stones are available with more color will keep,1
nothing technically wrong with product but the provider of product screwed up product described as fitted but received compression,0
one earing broke after 1 day,0
very tight does not stretch too much and the fabric is very thick to the point that the dress holds all wrinkles and basically stays away from your body its a very nice patern but it will be cold no matter the weather and drafty under the dress due to the fact that there isnt much fabric that comes in contact with the legs,1
i usually buy up a size on tunics to wear with leggings not necessary with this shirt a large would have been plenty big enough,2
just got this yesterday so far my husband seems to really like it it was very easy to adjust to his size fit well and looked nice,2
a little smaller than expected,1
dont sit near heat or open flame plastic will melt yes the material is not good at all,0
needed some new fishing specific shirts and i am very happy with this one it is extremely comfortable and seems to be made of durable material comparable to under armour or nike dry fit a less expensive quality substitute nice design and colors pop would recommend,2
this was not as pictured,0
this is 599 for one pair of flimsy and slippery socks if worn on most wood or tilebr br if i were to wear them to a beautiful and sandy beach they would likely be non slip,0
while cute this doesnt exactly look or feel like pajamas the quality is not the greatest and it doesnt feel soft or comfortable even after the initial wash its even a bit scratchy even though it fit fine and accurate my daughter stated it wasnt super comfy,1
heavier than expected and the brim is longer than expected not as cute as it looked in the pics sent back,0
the shirt has an excellent fit to it but its made with very inexpensive material you have to put something underneath to wear it to work,0
i just received this product not to long ago and i would like to send it back but i feel like its going to be nothing but a pain to try to get it returned the shirt is nice the material is decent however i thought that the shirt wouldnt look so uniformed which is one of the main reasons i got this shirt i usually wear a large and i got it a size large due to it being amazon and i figured it was coming from china which there sizes of course run small but this shirt more than likely will go to someone who can fit it because its not worth the time or hassel to try to send it back,0
,2
nice,2
i was surprised to find that the dress was not cut like the picture the skirt was an aframe skirt and the tops was too low felt cheap i was disappointed returned it,0
bought for my daughter they look nice but the first set had one with a very bent post and the other was missing a post sent in exchange and when we received the replacements they were also broken the exact same way save your money and order something else,0
nice color nice leather the shoe runs wide in the ankle which is weird the lenght is not short so i errored in ordering a size down just poor fitting nice wedge too returned,0
large little bit,0
you get what you pay for even worse i doubt if this belt is real leather at all it is stamped et702 italian style leather instead of authentic leather seems more like another cheap asianknock off but i blame myself for buying it i gave it a 3 for the good stitching,1
videoid9a5d257a03028d15158e64685f810508 it is flimsy and cheap the pattern is pretty much a sticker put on a flimsy clear case that is a little to loose on my phone it is not true to the posted images that show it being shiny like the better quality versions do not buy this it will not protect your phone from a drop,0
build quality is fine but stains my things and smells horrific,0
it doesnt match the rose gold on the fit bit,1
this is definitely a peice of junkmike,0
oh my these sandals are so cute im really enjoying them,2
parece de baby doll la tela y corre pequeño,0
this hat is much smaller than the picture shows,0
this dress is great quality and fit really well the corset back allows for a more custom fit it was fully double lined which was great we had a hard time finding a dress for my 14 year old that fit her perfect but this was a home run she loved it we bought the floor length full slip to wear under so she wouldnt step on the bottom of the dress and it gave it a more full look i did add straps and had to hem it a bit but other than that it was perfect not sure what the recommendation is for washing but i did hand wash it and it seems to have washed well,2
these are child sized,0
very basic almost amish is simplicity wish i would have returned,1
cheaply made,1
this necklace is very thin and fragile,0
item shipped promptly they were a little long for my liking and the heads came off easily but for the price it wasnt a total waste,1
these shirt are terrible terrible terrible the xl is at best a medium and they are cut wrong highly do not recommend,0
no do not buy way to small and had a bad smell,0
i wore it once and see what happened to the dress all overbr br extremely disappointed,0
i am 53 and about 155 pounds i bought a large and the bottoms fit perfect but the top seemed like it was a sizes smaller im a 36b so its not like i have a huge top half i definitely cannot wear this without things popping out,1
i loved this out for fourth of july i ordered a 69 month old and it perfect the shorts are soft and the tshirt was soft too really happy with purchase,2
i only wore my sandals once and the buckle of one of my sandals is breaking im scared to wear them again,0
ok,1
its super form fitting so unless you have a buff body i wouldnt buy this one,1
it said it is 925 but the bracelet is not sterling silver but i like the bracelet its pretty,0
very pretty comfy panties but the bra squeaksi guess its the plastic rings that hold the strap but its annoying and a bit uncomfortable,1
i absolutely love these flip flops they are super comfortable and they are true to size 1010 would buy again,2
love these there are no under the boob sweat marks showing no matter how hard i sweat,2
i ordered 2 packs of the same letters and one of the packs didnt have all of the letters or numbers highly disappointed because ive waited to style my crocs and cant because mybr order was messed up or used,0
very cute but sizing does run small if you are tall over 5 734 this isnt going to work as a dress even as a large the large fits more like a medium very glad we opted for a bigger size,1
lindo,2
the is not for big boys,0
i got a medium it is extremely tight around my biceps i workout but my arms arent that big fit fine around my forearms and everywhere else,1
this was really overpriced i think i could have picked it up at the trinket store for about 5 or less its pretty but very cheaply made the chain was junky so i moved it to a better chain i had fortunately i wont wear this that often it looks like the stones are not set very well glued in and will fall out any time oh well its a nice size and looks fine with my christmas red and black,1
the pants are nice however my husband had large calf muscles he would die is he knew i said that and due to that too small very narrow at the bottom however nice quality fabric,1
this slipper did not fit at all like a 3e it was beautiful and well made but definitely not the size we needed,1
if youre looking for compression functionality to reduce feet swelling save your money these ones labeled as 1520mmhg didnt work at all if these are labeled correctly then 1520mmhg is insufficient compression to help counteract the swelling of my feet doctor recommended compression stockings next time will have to look specifically for the 2030mmhg to see if that level works better while putting onwearingtaking off these 1520mmhg feel no different from normal knee socks no feeling of added compression is apparent at all now i have 3 pairs of knee socks rather than compression socks as to the sizing i used their guidelines and got a size l and they loose and very long i had to fold them down at the top but then i am a 53 female,0
this is a wonderful company to work with i plan on focusing my future purchases with them their customer support is the best,2
purchased as a gift for my 8yo and she loves them its been a few months and they seem to be holding up great under the careless use of a child so id say that they are pretty good quality also,2
terrible fit the material looks like it came from a cheap halloween costume,0
thin quality not what i thought,0
at first my daughter was delighted with these as they look just like the expensive boots but are much more affordablebr br that said the heels of the soles have worn through into the hollow heel in less than two months of wearbr br this is not acceptable and therefore i cannot recommend these boots,0
videoidf191229150686e261b42ce9be60bfe05 me gustó la calidad i se mira bien pero no tiene el broche y no puedo usarlo me gustaría que revisen mejor antes de enviar,0
well it is loose unflattering wrong fit,1
nice soft underwear but a little too thick and bulky,1
doesnt infect or irritate my ears but very flimsy once you open it its very difficult to get the hoop back to the original round shape i can still get away with the earring looking round on my ear but when you take it off the hoop will be noticeably misshapen,0
the cut of the jumper was off i order xl and it didnt fit the top bottom was ok,2
this is such a great idea my husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out i like the designs of these so it is not as embarrassing to pull out if you are out to eat this is super long and i would prefer it to be a little shorter but that is ok it is also a little tight around my neck but works,2
as a self proclaimed underwear snob i really wanted to like these i had hoped they would be close enough to saxx to work for daily wear plus they are made from recycled polyester which is another plus unfortunately you get what you pay forbr br my main complaint is that the pouch does not go deep enough for me so it requires a bit of adjustment to get in to it other brands do not have this issue except shinesty given the fabric content i was expecting a smooth polyester but it feels closer to a cheap cotton having a smooth fabric i find reduces friction and these do not provide that as effectively as others after one wash one of the pairs had a long thread come loose i am sending these back but from this i am not convinced that the durability would be all that greatbr br ive posted pictures comparing the pouches to other brands i would suggest saxx duluth tradings bull pen 2undr or obviously over the hanes even though they are all more expensive,0
brought for my son and he loved them,2
nice roomy top,2
i only gave it 1 star because you cant give a product a 0 very flimsy and poorly made,0
a little feminine looking but thats offset by the large dial facewatchband hard to use overall a good buy,1
fits great but the wires on bottom bent the first time i wore it,1
for a womens 2x this runs very small its about the size of a womens large also the chemical smell coming from this shirt was strong so it must be the dyes they use in china i notice that with a lot of dyedpainted things made in china formaldehyde or something,0
magnetic sunglasses are the only item my grandson requested for christmas he wanted to know which bag had the sunglasses by shear luck it was the first bag he opened he was so excited he was shaking he has been wearing them every day since i dont think he takes them to school but i will ask did i say he is autistic grandma definitely got the prize for the best gift this year he also loves glasses that transition but they were too expensive and he loves the ones that come apart at the nose piece to put in your pocket self entertainment i would love to have the ones for night vision myself he wont give them up long enough for me to try them out excellent choice highly recommend,2
looks cheap,0
i was nervous this would be a little tight since i am a a 40e but its actually very comfortable the sleeves fit just right ey are not too tight and the lace doesnt itch im getting more colors,2
umm 2 pairs of sun sleeves did not arrive 1 pair arrived is there another pair on the way,0
this dress was delivered quickly and it is amazing not disappointed at all i wish i could take a picture with it on but its a gift for my mother im in love with this dress great quality this dress eased my fears of buying dresses online,2
this is the worst quality hanes product ive ever had and makes me wonder if this was actually some cheap knockoff i never actually got to wear these tights because they developed multiple runs on each leg when i was simply putting them on im very disappointed,0
lower your expectations to the level of the price and you wont be disappointedbr biggest issue to me was the extremely long delivery time,1
it fits well but it rides up it goes from tealength to miniskirt in 5 steps im normally a size 2 and am 5 834 i ordered a size small if your just standing around its fine if you plan on walking maybe get a size larger,1
see through definitely not squat proof,0
these are nice and they fit but im definitely gonna need a garter belt or something to hold them up cuz i have thigh meat not a lot but decent sized thighs and they slip down maybe they were designed with super skinny girls in mind,1
bought these for my disney trip they are more the shiny spandex but very comfy print is perfect,2
the legs are 15 inches too long will return,0
consbr stylized creases on the front and fading on the legs which isnt detailed in the description or picturebr ran small could barely button them yet i wear a 31 waist in every other brandbr very thin material felt and looked cheap,0
i love these beautiful earrings they are very pretty and i will wear them all the time thank you very much,2
just what i needed,2
very bad quality,0
thick material,0
size does not coincide with charts,0
the material feels nice the band and the face pieces feel sturdy and strong enough to not cause any issues i find it hard to pish the cards out with folded cash under the band wish there qas a better way to carry cash with it,1
i am starting to wonder why i order clothes off of amazon this shirt is super thin which is what i wanted its just too small fits more like between a medium to large i followed the size chart,0
for some reason the pin is a tiny bit to small n band doesnt stay on i know i ordered the right sixe 18mm,1
they look cool and fit over my glasses well there is a seem at the bridge of my nose that could be a little more comfortable,1
the product was the correct color and size feels durable,2
not as large as wanted but doable has very sparking stone pretty nice but will look for larger radius next time,1
i bought this because i was moving every time i folded it jewelry would come out had to put carefully in a separate bag just in case my jewelry came out,0
the absence of the product,0
i really loved the material stretch and comfort of these swim shorts however the only thing that i didnt like was that they definitely were longer than what is depicted in the picture the picture shows that they come to your knee but the person in the picture must be like 6 tall because im 54 and they came almost to my ankles thankfully they have the drawstrings so i can pull them closer to my knee and secure them in place otherwise it would be like wearing pants in the waterlol,1
she loves themthey dont stay charged for the whole day she comes from school and plugs them up so she can light up everything,2
material isnt that comfortable and it fit kinda weird if you are shorter it would be good for leggings but im 5 6 and it hit just below my waist,1
this shirt is a cool tee but it is 100 cotton and shrinks upon washing i think it is also more of a european size which runs smaller than us sizing,1
too small crappy material,0
i love it simple and classy i already own the pocket watch version of this watch and plan on getting the black dial version next month i chose this watch go the blue hands and the manual wind no automatic or quartz watch for me except for the gym 62 gshock it looks even better in person,2
its fit perfectly for a person that is petite,2
na,2
my daughter is in high school and is very much into science she wanted these earrings for their science origin but also because they were pretty she wore them to her senior prom and they looked fantastic alot of people recognized them as dna stands but others just thought they were beautiful earrings they are very well made and very pretty,2
great style but size runs small on me and the black fabric was too shiny for me reluctantly returned,0
purchased for my husbands work nice and soft and thicker than most white pants ive bought for him he didnt have to worry about what color underwear he had on it ran a little big and super easy to iron,2
every piece you can think of except for the zippers had fallen off the mask including the teeth,0
they run small same size in medgear is fine these are at least a size smaller the color is also very dull upon returning them the shipping and a 5 fee for something were deducted for a total of 13 not refunded poor quality poor vendor i would not recommend at all,0
im using these for spin classes and in less than one month the seams are coming apart in 2 different locations along the inside knee and the front waist they fit fine and were comfortable but not well constructed,0
they are nice but they come and done kind of too easily so thats why i gave it three stars,1
i am six and still they are a little tiny for me but very cute they do not go off even if u sleep with them,1
super cute but had way more of a yellow tint than i expected looks like the picture,1
super comfy i wear them all day,2
really cute and good quality bought it for my kiddo that is obsessed with five nights at freddys and its now her favorite book bag charm,2
not sure how it can be possible but i tried this shoe on in the store and it fit fine just cost more than at amazon so i ordered the show arrived and was way too small,1
baja calidad,1
unless your child has a tiny head or likes hisher glasses pressed into hisher skull these will be too tight i bought them for my 8 yo daughter to use during gymnastics she cant use them they grip really well and would work great for maybe an infant,0
reviewed by my wife this charming starfish necklace is perfect for a beach vacation the little starfish have a lot of personality the combination of the larger amethyst starfish with the two smaller ones is perfect the chain is sturdy the necklace comes in a gift box and would make a delightful gift,2
received the amount as promised however there were 5 i had to throw away because they were already turned on and batteries were dead in addition it does fly fully light up only in the area in which the onoff switch is,1
i ordered a size up afraid it would run small but had to exchange for my actual size love the jeans feel great look great,2
i ordered the ramble rose and the bottom lace and tassles were green instead of beige i thought perhaps i had misjudged the pictures but they show a clear closeup of beige tassles whats worse however is that the tassles are very weak one tassle was too long and i pulled on it in hopes they were sewn in pairs and all the tassles started to unravelbr br thankfully im a seamstress so i could repair or remove the silly tassles the rest of the cardigan is great just like it looks thin and flowy sharp print beautiful colors the picture posted by another reviewer is accurate to the true colors with the unadvertised green tassles,1
i do really like this shirt and it is exactly as the picture however after one or two washes it started losing significant color and started falling apart very unfortunate as it was very comfy and everyone in the office complimented it but i only got to wear it twice so only giving it 3 stars,1
the shirt looks good and it appears to be high quality but i order a ladies small and got a childs 56 watch the sizing,1
says sold as pair multiple times i got one not cool,0
size ok thickness or weight of fabric not,1
grate shoes just bit to large what is a benefitial on the long run,2
broke when i held it up redambdiculous,0
i thought it would be bigger but i wound up using it as a pocketbook it works well and it forced me to not load it up with junk,2
i ordered 2 of theseone green and one red both xxl i usuall wear xl but i read that they run small they definitely do also for some reason the red is overwhelmingly smaller than the green even though i ordered the same sizethe green is definitely smaller than an xxl i never wear that size they arrived in the same shipment but were packaged differently the material seems dressy and luckily at least one fit relatively well the red will be returned,0
wow so freaking disappointed saw the other review but thought it would be a 1 off ugh the kurta is pink not a soft mauve the sharara is maroon not any shade of purplebr br and at 2x its tight i bought the blackgold lengha which was awesomebr br this was supposed to be me birthday outfit,0
very flimsy it is small and so thin that its like a piece of paper i was deceived please do not throw your money away a terrible buy almost like a scam,0
absolutely love it,2
perfect,2
is exactly what i was hoping for great quality and great price,2
ive had my bracelet set for a few months and weirdly the purple just faded pretty bracelet though,2
this shoe model is smaller than typical samesize shoe should get one half size larger,1
opened up the package watch looked great no second hand movement or anything else,0
i love the quality of this purse,2
fabric was so thin that everything showed through itbr i know its made to be worn very loose and flowing but ithink it was at least a size too bigbr i,0
you get what you paid for got them for 11 obviously look better on picture they fit well lens arent bad,1
a little bulky but otherwise alright,1
ok,1
too short for 510,1
these headbands are adorable and were a big hit in the christmas eve gift boxes i put together with pajamas and a book,2
videoidfdf3aad3ef83acf5515197879ad68cc i would highly recommend anyone to get this the bezel rotates it is cool looking and works flawlessly i am denying some reviewers had bad experience but as me this is perfect 8 min of sun for 3 months of battery you dont even need sun charges with the indoors electric light waterproof price look what else can you ask for,2
the compass and the temperature dont work i guess it is for show only,0
i ordered the largest size and i still couldnt get it past my thighs they are cute and all but i kinda wish they were bigger,0
these are so easy to use and the titanium is lightweight no more splitting your fingernails or having to use a knife or a screwdriver pry open the split rings i never buy a different kind of split ring again,2
pants would be nice but they are extremely long,1
bought these shoes from a brickandmortar storefront of a major shoe chain hence the lack of 34amazon verified purchase34br br i had to purchase shoes as part of my uniform for nursing school well not specifically these shoes but they needed to be either black brown or white no mesh being a male the number of shoes for nursing is very limited and when you have to adhere to uniform requirements it can be tricky to find comfortable shoes that fit the requirementsbr br theyre definitely safe and ive had no issues when it comes to slipping despite the ungodly liquids ive walked through they fit pretty well and i dont feel like im going to lose them when i walkrun theyre not the most comfortable but they may just need to be broken inbr br im not sure if theyll come with the 34sketchers antislip34 logo on the laces but it can be cut off pretty easily if they are on it anytime you need a black shoe that wont allow liquid in these will work perfectlybr br they also look great with scrubs as a side benefit,2
nice windstopper jacket that is thin enough for me to wear under my leather jacket it keeps me warm and does a good job blocking wind the zipper seems a bit long though as when its fully zipped there are some wavy lumps the collar seems slightly too tall in the front as well but ill still use it,2
cute ideabr looks a little cheapbr zipper is terriblebr never got it zipped all the way then it broke,0
get these asap,2
you have to be kidding me 3 times a charmbr well not for me i got the same size delivered 3 time to big wth,0
these were a total waste of money thebr color faded and they would not stay on,0
all in all they are just ok the colors are fine on some 4 of them are completely off shipping time was whatever took a while but i expected that they are a pain in the ass to adjust and prone to breaking the emblems are made nice enough but the ring material is very cheap i didnt receive a box rather a piece of foam in bubble wrap i didnt recieve zetsus ring at all instead being sent 2 of itachis dont buy this,0
i really liked the color of these lenses but they didnt even come close to fitting properly big disappointment,0
these were cool gift for my kids 1 stopped working the 1st week and my sons head got burnt bc it was snowing and it got wet the other lasted about a month then just stopped charging to charge the bluetooth speaker you have to completely take out everything from the hat they were soft and stretchy but when the speaker is in it pokes into the side of your head so not comfortable to wear they are not meant to be worn when it is rainy or snowing there is no protection for the electrical stuff inside and you will get burned very hard to sync to phone because there is just 1 button and a led light nothing more,0
because of several surgeries and my le lymphdema i really have a hard time finding shoes from all the reviews i though these would work they didnt but i did gave them to a friend of mine and they work perfectly for her the fit review is from her,1
excellent,2
terribly thin socks no padding at all the inside is covered in the stitching thread ends see photo these are going to fall apart the first time you wash them uncomfortable and ridiculously low quality item returning immediately dont waste your time,0
super cute vintage lake hat,2
ive worn ariat cobalt boots riding horses for years and love them but theyve been discontinued these were recommended as a replacement they are awful the ankles are too big but put pressure on the achilles tendon the toe box is narrow terrible boots i wish i could return,0
didnt fit over my husbands glasses,0
the only issue is the side edge of the bottom lining that tends to rub against my foot arch right shoe only but its wearing off,2
these are so bright and shiny lol i love the quality of these charms they are so cute very pleased with this purchase,2
its a beautiful dress but fit is too loose in some places i really wish i could return it wore it for a wedding this weekend and i was constantly struggling with it,1
i really wanted to like these flip flops but they flopped around too much on my feet felt like my foot slid down to the toes too had to send back ordered a different brand,1
i like these shorts super comfy and cute,2
too small it fit my 12 year old daughter like it fits the mannequin ill be returning this,0
was cute but didnt come up as high as i expected my belly button was showing,2
looks good,2
i buy most clothes from romans or womanwithin their same size as this brand are far from equalbr i needed some of these in a hurry so i looked on amazon and got them the next day i have been stuffed into thembr ever since until i can do laundry i guess it pays to look at size charts and not just fits true to size,0
just as seen on picture,2
just ok,1
showed up with a hole in it appeared to be from a cigarette,1
fits well very comfortable however after several washes there are some holes forming usually my underwear starts to split at the seam on the top elastic band when they are getting to the end of their useful lives the hoerev underwear however is developing holes elsewhere eg in the crotch also if i wear them with jeans or a skirt they ride up my butt crack so now i only wear them when im also going to wear pantyhose to keep them in placebr br while these are comfortable im disappointed in the quality and expected them to last longer,1
looks absolutley nothing like the photo this is an extremely cheap and ugly holder the holder is thin hard leather with a cheap gold stamp it is not recessed like the photo the leather itself looks and is shiny and cheap again nothing like the photgraph there were also several small lumps about the size of a sesame seed under the leather i think they got sanwiched in there when glued i am returning it,0
didnt recieve all of my order,0
pretty,0
item matches discription perfectly very happy with my purchase,2
not properly made,0
im a size 18 and these fit ordered the biggest size i got them for around the house and sleep shorts they are very comfy and hold my little tummy in since ive got a big butt so they show alittle booty but my husband appreciates that,2
they are big but was expecting that im not one to complain but omg they have this terrible chemical odor i cant get it off ive washed them with dawn and other shampoos it wont go away im going to leave them outside for a bit and see if that works they also had like black smudges on the back when i opened them but they came out when i washed them they added a hair tie with a yellow bow on it it was a nice addition but because of the strong odor on it as well i think it will have to be trashed by all means the shoes are gorgeous but just that smell filled up my house quick and gave me a horrible headache,0
the fit was generous and i could have easily bought one size smaller than the chart indicated the material was okay not great and a bit stiff but not terrible dress is fully lined with some boning in the bodice for support so it would not require a bra if your chest filled it up which mine did not even come close 44c in the photos i loved the style but in person it was not flattering on wide hipsbutt and it looked more like a mother of the bride dress than anything a 30something year old would wearbr returning it was a pain because seller wanted to offer alternatives like i could resell the dress before allowing a return and also kept commenting on how it was made to the sizes on the chart and basically it was my fault it didnt fit even though i never said it didnt fit it was plenty roomy and i planned to have it altered if i had liked it but i had to keep telling them i just didnt like it and i wanted a return for full refund once i was given the return address in the us i had to ship it back at my expense and provide emailed documentation of tracking number and shipping receipt they later reimbursed me once the dress was received back just not worth the hassle and the wait for it to arrive in the first place,0
i like it slim and will hold just enough cards when it stretches out a little,2
the dress is very nice comfortable i love the fit it is true to size i love it so much that i bought two dresses one navy blue one multi color both are beautiful,2
these athletic socks are a welcome deviation from the usual white and black the colors are rich and surprisingly fashion forward but their good looks do not come at the expense of comfort they are thick and warm the fit snugly providing plenty of cushioning they are warm and the fabric posses moisture wicking properties that insure all day comfort the length is good and they dont droop or fall they appear to be well made and durable machine wash cold using only non chlorine bleach as needed tumble dry low,2
my daughter wore it on her shoulder with a couple items inside she bent down to pick up an item and the strap broke i like the purse style yet its not durable,0
this shirt is perfect it is so comfortable light weight well made and the fact that it is made in america makes it that much better i already ordered 5 more of the shirts from this company arrived 4 days before expected delivery date i had melanoma and have to wear sun blocking clothing i am a warm person and these shurts do not make me hot very very comfortable i will be ordering more stuff from this company,2
too small didnt fit as hoped for and had to send back,0
great product my wife was very happy with them,2
it is beautiful accents just about anything perfectly and the chain is adjustable,1
i ordered my normal size but the shaft and foot were to narrow had to return,0
bought one a few weeks ago liked it so much bought 5 more in different colors,2
the box was torn and broken but the gloves inside are ok average disposal latex gloves dont expect too much,1
i couldnt tell where the sleeves were supposed to hit as they almost went down to my wrist alas i see the photo that its a 34 length sleeve to short for one length but definitely too long for 34 lengthbr ive also discovered upon my first wearing that a sleeve button is missingbr im wearing the sleeves rolled up but would have preferred to not have to go button shopping for a mere button and then handsewingbr it was terribly disappointingbr other than that its cool for hot summer days in the office and is a nice looking top,1
super cute tts,2
they dont fit that snuggly,0
the color on top runs off after about two weeks of wear color rubbing off from putting hands in pockets good for though,0
i wore these shoes out last night for the very first time and the whole upper half and straps separated from the soleplatform of the shoe they basically fell completely apart on 1st wear i loved the shoes but i had them shipped to me over a month ago not sure if its to late to return them,0
this does not hold a lot can not have checkbook and money in it at same time or clasp doesnt work,1
bought these for christmas and wore them almost every day in december my daughter also enjoyed them,2
really liked them until the left one fell apart,0
i really like the comfort of these sketchers but will not buy online again the sizing is hit or miss the first time i ordered these in a 65 since i usually wear between a 65 and 7 the 65 was short in the toe but bearable so i kept them and ordered a 7 for longer walks with the dog perfect wore those out and ordered another 7 they fit like the 65 pair i will make the trek to the sketchers store from now on,1
when you live in a place like i do you have to deal with peoples 25000lumenrated led headlights somehow this is completely legal and everyone is ok with it i however have to drive in the dark every day and that stuff is blinding these glasses are really fantastic i wouldnt drive without them at this pointbr they work so well,2
ok i dont exactly know how to explain what wrong with this top its like it wasnt cut correctly maybe it dips down in the front almost like you would expect a maternity shirt to do i typically wear a 2x in normal clothes and a 3x in scrub tops a 2x in this would have been too small across the chest but the 3x is too big im confused,1
i wanted to love this sweater it looks like a nice timeless basic from the images when i unwrapped it and looked it over the first thing i saw was one cuff coming apart at the seam i also noticed it is an open weave and so you must wear something under it unless youre going somewhere it is appropriate to show off undergarments my life isnt this exciting and as a rule i just dont like the cami look underneath you cannot order your normal size and expect to pull it off the shoulder it just isnt designed for that the neckline is quite nice asis though wide enough for a nice feminine look further to wear tanks underneath the straps would show if you tried to pull off an offtheshoulder look not sure why they plug that so much in images it would be pretty enough as it isbr br since the split in the cuff was small i wore it to a holiday function with a cami fully expecting it to split more as the hours wore on which it did a little bit its on the knit cuff so im pretty sure i can mend it myself the sleeves are scratchy and stiffer than id like though since i ordered this as an occasional holiday time sweater i didnt worry about that much holiday clothes are always less comfortable than your daily ones i really like the fit so suggest going with your normal size id give this four stars but the stitching problem and the open weave bodice that is depicted differently in images make it lose a star for me,1
im a guy dont need to 34feel pampered34 but i do like to work in my unheated home office in san francisco writing code where the inside temp is often cooler than 60º f these gloves are great for thatbr br during a cold snap i started biking to caltrain with these gloves on they did not fall apart unlike the cheapo replacementsbr br lost my only pair so i hope vendor gets more of these in stock would like to order a couple pair for replacements,2
too small,2
the shipping was fast but of course i had to pay more i got a totally different cap and these caps arent cheap i am very dissatisfied i ordered two more items they are supposed to get here tomorrow i hope i dont get something different,0
it is a gift i hope it fits,1
looks great,2
i received the mens slipon hiking boots in the size i ordered but they were 12 size to small and were very stiff to wear i gave this 3 stars because of the customer service was acceptable in that they did not hesitate to accept their return ans send me a refund i did not order any more bootsshoes from them,1
headline says it all,1
while i really like this merino wool 95 elastane 5 racer tank top its gaps open in the back on me guess i need to lose some weight before it will drape properly i really liked the back open feature about it initially or the idea of it i love the plum color as most workout clothes are black or gray ive been trying to introduce some purple and blue into my yoga and workout clothes so its not so boring i also like that this top is antiodor as i can really build of a sweat after being on the elliptical after 30 minutes i will keep this top and use it in my home gym when no one else is working out with me once i lose some weight then i wont feel so timid about wearing it around others its nice and soft and i really like it except on me seems its pattern is for slender individuals,1
i liked the form fitting ness i disliked how small it was tight it was,1
you cant use your finger when you wear this it bulges up at the knuckle quality is okgood had to return,1
material very cheap looking,0
if you wear a medium get an extra large they run small,1
me agrado todo el diseño,2
my husband said they feel good once he gets them on however they are definitely not easy oneasy off it took him at least 15 minutes to get them on if you are weak or you are buying for someone that is weak this is probably not the compression sock to buy,1
this turned out to be exactly what i was looking for very well made nice length,2
they are on the delicate side so you have to be a little careful with them not bend them to much mine do come out sometimes because i have long hair and they get caught up sometimes but i like them and i think they look pretty in different than your average hoops,2
i ordered my usual size m as i just wanted a cute set of pjs but the top is definitely not as long as is shown in the photos absolutely a cropped top barely made it to my natural waistline and im not heavy chested by any means 34b the bottoms are either baggy or ride super high but still wearable with a different shirt overall the set just looks odd together,0
hmm i got a size smaller than i actually am and it was still too big apparently i cannot exchange it for a different size obviously i wouldnt say its amazing but its good for the price just order one that is a lot smaller than what you would usually get,1
very nice jacket beautiful soft leather and a perfect fit more than worth the price,2
lens scratched up within first hour,0
a perfect gift this year for my grandkids i chose a photo for each of them from the past and decided a gift would relate we took one granddaughter to the national gallery to see the lichtenstein exhibit a few years back i had a photo of her under a poster outside it was the one and only time she has been introduced in an art gallery to a major exhibition she is graduating and headed into graphic design i thought lichtenstein perhaps had had an influence in a minor way about graphic design so i selected this image for her and chose the lichtenstein umbrella even though i dont think young people use umbrellas so much big hit and i believe spoke to her as i had hoped she would receive it she was very excited and the first time that day after other gifts coming her way that she showed that kind of excitement whether she uses it or not i loved the gift and experience,2
loveeee super comfy has phone pocket,2
honestly this thing is barely sewn together nothing has a hem it may work as a polishing cloth at best,0
very long good for toddlers but infants they are extremely long even when scrunched,1
just what i needed,2
the fabric for this dress is beautiful and the dress isnt sheer i expected since it is in asian sizing that it would run short it does not i am curvy and short i wish it fit without a ton of alterations but it is made for a taller slim person,1
i know these were only 10 bucks but when they say oversized you think it would be a little bigger these glasses were made from a cheap material they are glossy not flat color like they were supposed to be got them wet and the paint started to fade they are very narrow and the arms are really short presses right on my temple i tried actual oakley holbrooks and they were even shaped different just save up and get the real thing,0
nice sweatshirt need larger sizes,2
no comment,1
cute but need to be smaller,1
it looks better than the display picture,2
this dress is more like a long shirt unless you are a flashy person you may want to wear leggings or tights with this dress,1
the fit was awful i do not recommend these boots,0
works good as expectedbr and for the ignorant 34anti 2nd amndmnt34 blame the person not the g u n,2
my daughter loved it so much it fits good very nice fabric and of good quality it a beautiful dress good to wear for parties or for dress up days,2
i purchased this watch for my moms birthday i was concerned about the size as the image makes the watch appear a little larger than real life its a beautiful watch she loved it and the size was perfect i am taking stars off because it did not come with a functional battery i had to get it changed before i gave it to her,1
i took off one star because the blue in the pin has a purple hue when in sunlight making it the wrong color however it may never see sunlight so will still make a good gift,2
its very cute but i dont think it will last long i wish it was better made id pay more my world is upside down the continentsoceans are upside down if anyone is looking at me while wearing it if i hold it while wearing it the world is fine metaphor anyone,1
i purchased an expensive pair of shoes and could it believe that they bruise the back of my foot i purchased this product and it saved my foot i can walk in those shoes all day with these heel pads great price for a great product,2
this shirt didnt quite fit like i would have liked i am 54 130lbs with a leanmuscular build similar to the model in the photo i ordered a s but found it had boxy fit it had no tailor to it chest to waist was all one width and the shirt ended just below my belt making me look bloated the shirt was only 10 so i wasnt expecting a whole lot which is why i put 3 stars but the photo shown is a bit deceiving i am not sure whether i want to keep or return it yet,1
beautiful watch head looks really well made and just shines the bracelet though is disappointing its cheap and gaudy looking i have doubts the crystal are actually swarovsky there is absolutely no sparkle to them returned it,1
way too small with everything adjusted to the largest possible it might be a medium,1
one of the circles on the side of the glasses came out so i have one black circle and one silver im ok with that,2
i ordered three pairs at least one button has already popped off two pairs in only a few uses which is unfortunate because these are great pants the fit is just right but theyre useless with missing buttons ill probably see them back on but i shouldnt have to do that so soon,1
doesnt fit too small need to return,0
broken upon delivery i just threw it away the slide magnets werent in correctly,0
a little bulcky,1
it was not true to size its a gorgeous dress but not good for me,1
i was impatient to receive it but what i got was too tight returned it as i have received it although i have a prime membership but i had to pay for the return postage they might reimburse me later for it the only thing i like about it is the hat band,0
she liked the multiple colors and easy to wash and dry bought for granddaughter cshirt is multi,2
not as pictured not even close to current logo no way this is gm licensed no hologram license sticker cmon man,0
runs so small like for a small child,1
love this bag,2
they looked and felt nice but they dont last long at all just had a month wear and already falliing apart in 2 areas of the shoe the bottom and the mesh on top of the shoe were baby toe is located save your money unless you dont plan on wearing them a lot they are definely not to be used often in the pool,0
very nice watch recommended,2
this product runs small,1
rich color feel,2
these are lovely and subtle classy,2
way to big,1
it turnd my neck green lol,0
not really sure what i was expecting just didnt look right,1
three simply bc boyfriend didnt like style,1
i ordered l size based on the size chart and the fitting but that was too small and the seller couldnt help just asked to return though the material quality seems decent but size should be properly defined returned these,0
beautiful and functional,2
my husband wears it alot,2
the top portion fit well including the arms neck and chest im a 36dd so it wasnt pulling oddly it flairs out below the bust with way too much material as if itd be appropriate for maternity wear when i pulled it in with a belt there were extra folds of fabric that looked odd,0
i got this for my daughter and within a wk the first one broke the seller sent me another one and that has broken already too,0
must have for portal lovers its adorable,2
arrived with a split zipper leaving for vacation and no time to return very disappointed,0
i do like the feel of the pants and the color is fine for me the only issue i have is that the pants are very revealing they material isnt thick and it doesnt camouflage what you are endowed with lets say i didnt like the feeling that just anyone could freely see the outline of my junk just a word of caution to those who are a little more modest like i am,1
so simple,1
these pants are very cute and fit well but beware because they ruined all my clothes i washed them separately the first two times i washed them then i began doing them with my regular clothes and they stained all of my clothes i have these in two colors and both colors do the same thing,0
beautiful color looks high quality my boyfriend wore this to a wedding and it added an extra flair to his suit i love the simple design i would buy again from this company,2
arrived quickly very nice shoe for taekwondo classes,2
so pretty not too heavy and look fantastic love the style and quality made well and look great,2
too small for me and no returns for this item,0
the material is very very thin and does not fall but poofs out over your breasts and stands away from your torso would make an ok maternity top i returned this,0
comfortable sock but not really shaped correctly feet dont really fit in them as they are shaped more like a tube its pretty uncomfortable,1
the xl is to short and shrank when washed,1
looks good,2
there is absolutely no way this necklace is 925 sterling silver nor is it plated over the silver i have had it just a few days and my entire neck and chest has broken out in hives because i am allergic to nickel so obviously despite the claims it is in fact nickel its pretty to look at but i will never wear it again still trying to get rid of the hives,0
when the package arrived there was a horrible chemical odorbr i thought it was coming from the case and the offgassing would probably go awaybr after a couple of days they still smelled terrible so i decided to leave the case at home and start wearing the glassesbr i soon realized that the smell was actually coming from the lenses themselvesbr i returned them as quickly as i could get them packed up,0
the color and design are pretty it is pretty thin material any dark or white bra will show through i would not consider this a tunic to go with leggings it is not long enough to cover your butt or go past your upper thighs so that was disappointing what do you want for 10 it wont last long due to the thin material if you machine wash and dry,1
too much money for this product and they are very uncomfortable,1
its more like a windbreaker rain jacket so its not heavy,2
im usually an xl and the 2x was too small,0
dont work on touch screens,1
very small barely fits a child very think and flimsy,0
i really like these socks i bought for my 3 year old she is a bit short so right now they are more like thigh highs then knee highs but she will grow into them,1
this is definitely a relaxed fit shirt im about a 40r about 35 waist and the 1553435 is fairly large and roomy on me the sleeves run noticeably long normally 3435 sleeve fits me just fine but these are much too long around the waist it is pretty good it billows out like every commercial regular fit shirt does but its not ridiculously bad like some other shirts ive bought where i could fit three of me in the waistbr br the white is a nice sharp and bright white the stitching looks solidbr br the collar does stretch but only a little tiny bit,1
i will start out by saying i am a 12 12 exactly which my whole life makes you choose a 12 or a 13 and then hope they fit well enough the length on these is just about right but there is a decent amount of vertical room such that when you lace up there is a bit of bunching around the toe of the shoe the first thing i did was put these on in the house and walk around for a bit after about an hour my ankles were screaming in pain i have never had a pair of shoes do this so for the price i am keeping them i wont risk running in them but after a couple of weeks now they are great for taking the dog for walks and dont hurt my ankles anymore this may have just been due to changing shoes with different support structures but they dont feel cushiony enough to try and take on a run of any distance,1
a little more fittedtight than i thought it would be but i kept it because my husband liked it,1
nice,2
definitely was not emerald,0
the band is a little on cheap side but hey for the money not a bad deal at all looks pretty good too,1
great trailer real aluminum wheels built well out of steel big trailer meant for hauling the bigger crawlers like the scx10 and trx4 im going to pull it with a one eighth scale traxxas summit,2
silkies cant go wrong,2
good looking boots that keep the weather out and your feet warm easy on easy off with the short zipper sizing is accurate although they are a little loose at the top of the ankle which takes a little getting used to otherwise really enjoying these boots,2
the socks are beautiful and look just like the picture they are very thin and run super small better fit for a kid,1
cute stud earrings,2
the mask is what was expected however once one fits the nose clip the wording is difficult for others to read,1
they are super cute comfortable and fit great i want to buy more and am trying not to,2
it could be so flattering but its so much bunched up material in the back its actually heavy the back straps are sewn in weird as you can see in the picture,1
im a security guard and walk a beat this was my first night wearing these shoes and i could feel the plastic from the heel my shift could get over quick enough i couldnt wait to get these off my feet im sending right back,0
nicely made just a little big for small woman,1
did not fit frames,0
i personally would order 2 sizes larger if i reorder no problem with the quality with which theyre made,1
love these earrings gorgeous and elegant and a must have,2
i bought this for my husband for family pictures hes not exactly slim but it was pretty slimming on him its lightweight and looked great with a collared shirt underneath it was perfect,2
so far so good i have a hard time finding socks to fit around my calfs and then to stay up all day first day huge success they fit great and are comfortable hit my just below the knee love the socks,2
comfy and flatters,2
fits in pocket nicely holds a good number of bills nice slot to store credit card and transparent slot for id,2
very comfortable and soft recommend ordering one size up because of the disparity between top and bottom,1
these things are like barbed wire on the ears the straps are so thin and fragilelooking and when the mask is on they bunch up and really pull on the base of my ears its a constant occasionally sharp stinging sensation i will be returning these and looking for something less painful,0
very stylish shirt looks great with jeans,2
i really liked this hat but it was way too big for my head even with the included padding,1
these medium fit way smaller than all my other mediums,0
have 3 or 4 pairs of kc reaction shoes that i purchased of the same size these are the first that felt tight and will require quite a bit of breakin if i bother the shoes look good though and do like this brand normally,1
within two weeks the shoestring clips fell off you get what you pay for,0
no button hole i can cut one but am afraid it might ravel,1
works as an alternative when its too cold out to wear actual sheer tights,2
super cute bought for my granddaughter,2
i really hesitated to order it because i doubted it was durable but it is really durable and strong i really love it if someone are looking for adjustable strap for leather bag i would like to recommend this product without hesitation,2
is very nice love the look but brakes easy,1
so far so good seems like a good buy,2
love my cardinal bracelet i wear in memory of my father who passed in 1996,2
i bought these to replace an identical pair of pants purchased in person a few years ago they say they are the same size but are about 234 narrower in the hips than my old ones weird,1
love it and its so comfortable,2
it is on the smaller side the pendent looks good but not spectacular ok for everyday wear would not purchase it for a special occasion,2
too big,0
i guess i just sort of impulsed purchased these for my 6 month old and didnt look at the price i kept them cause i wanted them for him that much they are really adorable they are made really well and my husband thinks they are the greatest shoes ever made for kids we actually bought a larger size for when he grows out of these too,2
well if youre truly an xxl particularly with a large bosom you cant wear this i cant wear it i thought it would be stretchy enough but its not the fabric is soft thick so thick in fact that it would have been too hot for summer nights in arizona anywaybr br its only about one size too small unless you like your pajamas to be roomy size up once to fit size up twice for comfort,0
these are nice but like most track pants they run a little short on me i have a 3334 waist and inseam and while these arent too bad theyre still about an inch shorter then id like i dont know why they dont make track pants for men with longer inseams but its the reason why i dont wear track pants often the tag states that the inseam is 3134 but i bet thats too short for half the men who wear a mediumbr br other then that theyre greatbr br update i disagree with another reviewer who suggests that these are small in the crotch if anything id say that theyre too loose for size medium,1
this was a very low quality product the cost to ship for return was 30 of purchase price so im just throwing it away,0
its a beautiful skirt and i kept it even if its way too small since i hope to lose some weight i bought an xlarge,1
small but cute fanny pack the main compartment holds only a small skinny wallet sunglasses with case my iphone xr and my keys good zippers and strap its durable,1
poor quality and hand wash only definitely not intended for active wear we returned,0
right size but poor feel and fit,0
way too big for my baby,0
it says on the description blue mirrored lenses but they are not the typical mirrored lenses its more like a blue tint not what i expected but my daughter wanted to keep them anyways,0
i love this and the diaphanous effect off the chiffon,2
he loves the fit the function and the durability of these pants will last forever,2
great fit for me and my husband which would normally have to order two different sizes,2
i use them on the winter season and they are good in the inside if you use them on the outside you will not get the same results,1
waste of money broke within days the ball came off the post of the earring,0
very tiny,0
these fit small even for my newborn the gloves are really thin and dont stay on probably because theyre too small the hats are a good quality and cute just too small,1
pretty but looks flimsy,1
not great this is very thin paper towel would work just as well,0
comes in 2 small bags no directions creativity needed to create objective once figured out good product,1
very warm and comfortable fits easily in my coat pocket this hat can be machine washed and i love that it has a very comfortable inside and cozy liner that is made out of very soft fleece i have a sun hat that i wear over this hat so id like the style i highly recommend this hat,2
nice top,1
update i had to update my review after wearing the first gray undershirt of the 5 shirt pkg 3 black 2 gray although the fabric of the 2 colors looks and feels the same they do not wear the same the black shirts didnt stretch the gray ones donot as bad as those i mentioned in my original review below but more than id like i have no idea what the difference could be but there is a definite difference its not a disaster but it is rather a disappointment i docked one star from my original 5 star rating down to 4 starsbr would i buy them again knowing the gray ones arent as nice as the black ones since i only wear them under my shirt in cold weather and since 3 of the 5 are fine i likely would buy them again theyre still a big improvement over the last ones i got and a better price than the womens version of these shsirts that ive ever foundbr br original review i bought these for myself a woman because the price for the mens is less expensive than the womens version of undershirts like these i would buy an xl in womens size i got a medium in these mens shirts and the fit is perfect they are quite long so tuck in easily and stay there and best of all they dont stretch out the last ones i bought stretched out at least a full size after having them on for only a short time they were terrible these dont do that they keep their shape and they fit close to the body so arent detectable under clothing yet they arent tight they are great for how i wear them under my shirts in the cold mn winters i would buy them again without hesitationworth the money,2
secure clasp easy to unlock and lock the clasp really nice braided leather band exactly what i was looking for,2
color,2
i live in ca and driving in summer is so painful i get sun burn on my hands even with sun cream on so i decided to buy the golves to wear while driving i tried today i liked the fabric and the golves is very comfortable i am a female and i have large hand so i bought size large it is big for my hands so if you are a female and have large hand like mine i think size m will be perfect the gloves does not have the elastic thing around the rest as in the picture but it is fine it is not a big of a deal over all it is ok quality for the price,1
these shoes are what i expected but less than i had hoped for they are lightweight and easy to put on they have no arch support with the insoles supplied but work with my high instep as a rn there is no way id ever wear these for work or recommend them to someone they dont have much support and will easily let fluids into them they are more of a slip on shoe for doing quick things,1
very nice product and very pretty it is a perfect complement to my outfit each day as a teacher great for my room keys excellent product,2
very cutebut clasp is soooo strong its really difficult to open especially after you put them on being so small and tightly clasped made my ear lobes sore,0
you know i bought 2 of these and let me tell ya these puppies are the best umbrellas ive ever owned they hold their own against wind rain and im sure it will do well in snow ice the automatic 34spring34 is a bit tough to handle but it is sturdy youll get used to it and appreciate the construction the mcconnor is made wellit is not flimsy this is the best umbrella on the market dont delaybuy todayyoull be satisfied,2
hampton series seems thinner than 34leather34 and buckle doesnt hold as well buckle twist and pulls off belt,0
i bought them as a gift for me peridot is my charm stone i wore them each time i am in or out and each time when ive got nice comments from others i appreciate the value of shopping with amazon gem stone king is my best shop fulfilled by amazon this is not my first time i bought jewelry from them thanks,2
these run really small and the waist is not very stretchy i will be returning them,0
pros easy to adjust fold and waterproof color doesnt fadebr cons band gets caught on sleeves magnetic power is low not recommended while running,1
hope this is listening by seiko they release the seiko mini turtle has a precision according to the spec black case with in an excellent size comfortable size with no too much weight and volume easy to read at night but let me tell you i do not recommend to buy this watch at this time whybr for an exceptional watch like this seiko has released this watch using a bracelet that you can lose the watch easy easy this rubber strap is flexible but doesnt have any security and because is flexible and made out of rubber it can come out of your wrist like nothing how come seiko doesnt have in the market a black metal bracelet for this watch and the worst nobody has one besides this let me tell you no one 20 mm black metal bracelet in the market fit this watch i have tried three including from strapcodecom this watch without a black metal bracket is for just three stars be careful if you buy it you can lose it seiko today is becoming too commercial even that they are still good manufacturer,1
wow same backpack as they show in the picture i totally love it im in college and one of my main concerns is feeling comfortable because some days i walk a lot im even thinking about buying new pens and pencils because this backpack is sooo pretty i promise i dont regret buying it at all,2
i love soa i recently introduced a friend to the show and he is hooked he bought a bike and learned to ride so this seemed like the perfect bday present for him unfortunately while the chest and shoulders fit as they should the arms were way too tight and short he is an average 62 and not a gorilla so this came as a suprise now he has a great bike and a kid standing next to it wearing his birthday present kind of a disappointment,1
no way that 3xl,0
was a bit big for a 34kids34 hat but overall quality is exceptional very good and thick embroidering its both tall and wide for my head 6 58 hat size and i ended up sending it back writing this review as i believe it would be a great hat just need to measure your coconut not that sizing is provided so hope this helps,1
i would buy this style again in a different color i do love the comfort the color was not quite what i had expected so they have very limited use,2
the fabric is softcomfortable to wear but after just 1 monthhas ripped from the seam now have a big hole just under the armvery disappointed,0
this leather wallet is super minimal and stiff the front has an id pocket with room for two more cards the back has room for four cards and the center can hold some folded bills i found it difficult to remove the cards from the card slotsbr br theres a metal loop on top where keys can be clipped on the color is a deep forest green and the leather is texturedbr br the wallet also comes with rfid protection to protect your credit cards from scanners however i have no way of verifying if this works or notbr br it does not come in a giftable boxbr br personally i feel the current price of 1199 is too expensive for this it is super minimal and difficult to extract the cards out of some of the slots when it is full it is even tighter although it is functional this would not be my first wallet choice,1
i generally buy a medium and ordered a 10 as it said that the material runs small but one size smaller would have been better,1
purse is much larger and more structured than expected,1
cute durable easy to usebr makes it easy to find your black suitcase on the luggage carouselbr only complaint is that i dont think the strap is very durablesturdy i bought a package of zip ties from the hardware store and attached the luggage tag with one of those that luggage tag wont be coming off unless someone with a strong pair of scissors cuts it off,2
i didnt like the fabric felt plasticy and the fit was huge,1
they fit great and look cute but after a couple of washes they begin to look more like a jegging material and not the smooth finish it originally had that i liked,1
they didnt fit my son they run small,0
it stopped working after a week replaced the battery and now the only thing working is the second hand,0
comfortable and breathable material,2
soft but the 34 elephants actually look like rhinos or some sort,0
this purchase was a christmas gift,2
didnt like it fit is not great cant return,0
not a very good watch cant set the date as the directions say tried the stop watch and it stops on its own not impressed at all,0
this looked great in modeled pic on her made sense the designed piece is a bit confusing to wear at firstespecially the shoulder front flanged areaor is it a collar piece material is soft and comfortable just the right weight not flimsy or too bulky the light grey color is flattering and its all put together well took awhile but now im very comfortable in it and wear frequently,2
pants fit well great comfortable fabric and love the drawstring these are high waisted which i really like and the length is just right great lounge or workout pants,2
the shoes are super cute but left blisters in multiple locations on my feet not at all comfortable,1
i bought this for a halloween costume thinking i could wear it again in a casual setting im really disappointed by the fabric which really is that of a halloween costume its a costume polyester feeling blend and is not something i will probably wear again,1
this was awful nothing like the picture,0
honestly disappointed mine look nothing like the picture even if the color wasnt exactly the same i expected at least a little of the fire that every other moissanite i own has had including the others from gemstone king these look like synthetic sapphires like decent quality lab created sapphires but not what i was looking for i almost wonder if i was sent the right pair,1
poor quality worth half the price,0
the shirt i received was not poplin material was strange feeling not soft shirt was not in original package so maybe it was something different,0
wore these gloves for five minutes had to take them off to adjust something else on my costume only to find my hands smelled horrible these gloves leave your hands smelling fishy and disgusting they run small made of cheap material and i would not recommend them to anyone,0
nice hat but i think he likes the little goggled face too much he likes looking at it but not wearing it keeps taking it off to look at the face im guessing as he gets older it wont be as much of an issue,2
the zipper can be kind of irritating it will pull your hair scratch your skin catch on things etc if youre not railthin this dress is not always flattering,1
shirt area fit great but the straps were too long so it hung lower than where i wanted it to so i dont wear it and missed the return period if you have a short neck to chest area i wouldnt recommended getting because youll be swimming in the straps,1
just know u gonna need shoe stretchers,1
cheap flimsy and broke after 6 wears very disappointed outside the return time too so my loss,0
you get what you pay these glasses are very flimsey,0
granddaughter loved it a fun craft,2
super quick delivery my husband loves them ty,2
hat arrived a little smushed in the box but it wasnt too hard to put it back in shape the color is true to the photo the fit was ok for a small head like mine but a bigger head might not like the fit it was a little snug on me,1
not ideal for bigger girls didnt look right,0
way bigger than ear and didnt fit comfortably and looked terriable do not waste your money,0
order half a size down i ordered a 7 because my other adidas were a size 7 however the shoes ordered were bigger on me than id like as my heel would pop out when i walk i will be returning and ordering a 65 also the shoes are the real brand a quick google search will verify that adidas sells through amazon to the us you just have to make sure you purchase the brand name ones,1
i have purchased 3 different leggings this month from amazon from three different vendors all different prices from 699 2199 these being right in the middle i like all the leggings i have ordered but for the price and the feel i will be ordering these againbr sizing i looked all over the reviews for anyones measurements so here are mine for reference and i will tell you what i think of sizingbr 155 pounds 5734 30 waist and 40 hips 1012 slacks and 30 jeansbr i ordered the 2636 inch size i wanted the one size smaller which was not a huge difference but no black so these were itbr i have to say first when you look at the photos of the models one models pants look baggy and very low at the waist and these are not she must be wearing a plus sizebr these leggings are what i would consider high waisted at 1 ½34 above my belly button i have a waist of 3034 and they definitely will stretch to 3634 that said i have no idea the comfort level at 3634 stretch but these are very comfortable on mebr again looking at one of the models the legs look baggy they are not they hug the legs nicely not sucking anywhere but also not baggy what so ever they cling but do not have what i call snap but they comfortably snug the legs and not shinybr oh6262 in the crotch area there is a long triangle piece of material that has been sewn between the legs i have never seen this before on any leggings the material is exactly like the legging material with no cotton near the skin i have no idea why they sew these like that maybe it is a true churidar patternbr they are super long but they look great with the black you can not tell the are longer plus they are nice and tight at the ankle pictures br for the price these are some great leggings i can not attest to other colors but the black is very opaque not see throughbr these would be great for yogabr i would say if you are up to a size 16small 18 you could wear these leggings comfortablybr i am in love with indian clothes and i am still on the hunt for the perfect not hammer pants but similar if you love kurtis or longer tops these leggings are terrificbr wash in cold water and hang dry they come with no tags except size nothing about material or how to washbr very impressed,2
made in china very thin stretches out easily not a good product,0
the high magnification must be the cause of the coke bottle fit of glasses and framesbr they fall off my face constantly,0
i like these shoes and i wear them almost every day i walk a lot in them but the soles are cheap there isnt much support in them and no arch support at all i walk 57 miles 5 days a week in them and one night i was wearing them around a fire pit and the soles started to melt when i had my feet propped up dumb on my part i know they work for a walking shoe but i would suggest going to body and sole or a professional shoe place and being fitted for proper walking shoes if i hadnt spent 40 ish on these i probably would have gotten another shoe already,1
i agree with the previous reviewer who said that this top is cut more like a mens shirt it is quite boxy which is somewhat remedied by it being on the longer side but it definitely doesnt fit how it looks on the model the material is a nice and soft jersey but it is thicker than i expected so the top also doesnt flow how i would have liked its a decent shirt and i will still wear it but i am a bit disappointed,1
there too big width wise to stay around your neck not happy with them at all,0
the color was a much lighter blue than pictured also the fit wasnt as flattering as the picture,1
these socks are a lightweight wool perfect for layering and boots,1
very nice perfect travel prayer shawl,2
im going to buy another color since i loved this dress so much i love how its able to combine modesty and sexy the length of the slit hits the right spot not too high love the stretchy fabricits very comfortable for reference i am 55 tall 115 lbs i ordered a size small i am very pleased with this dress and highly recommending it,2
i loved it but it was too big for my wrist the smallest holes were not small enough,1
awful scratchy material and faded color,0
waste of money,1
love this bra i recommend trying these if you are having a hard time finding a wireless bra that fits well generally i use underwire bras but these are a nice bra to change to nice bra,2
very soft stretchy and comfortable great value,2
if you want the feel without the realif you want the nice without the pricethe movement is a quality well known japanese leader in quality automatic movements all the charm without the harm a worthy purchase,2
within a short time the buttons fell off and the seam on the side split outbr they are warm and comfortable but not very good quality,1
way too small im a 38dd it didnt come close,0
great,2
i ordered rose gold and it turned silver after a couple weeks still cute though and never turned my toe green,1
nice joggers for the price fit like a slim fit pants comfy and soft material,2
they fit perfectly when i got them but after washing them they shrunk a size smaller buy the next size up,1
i love the color softness great for grandchild with sensory challenges yet sleeves are long it is not a problem as then the sleeves do not ride up far because youchild can hold them,2
it is a stunning dress and the maroon color is beautiful great quality fabric but just too small i wear a 46 in us clothes and ordered this in a medium could barley get it zipped up will probably reorder in a large,2
it doesnt fit for females who have a lot of hair to put in it,0
this is light weight and comfortablebr easy to clean,2
they fit nicely theyre wider than the other pair i bought for black friday sales,2
gildan has a reputation to be desired when it comes to apparel a lot of our custom company polo style shirts are gildan and theyre made to last the shirts on amazon are no different you may run into a few quality issues from time to time but thats every brand well known or not the long sleeved shirts i got arent tagless like the picture but still the color size and materials are whats described fit and finish are as expected being a 5050 cotton poly blend have little to no shrinkage after washing theyre soft and last a long time i have several of their short sleeved tshirts and they still look like brand new even after repeated washings and daily wear quality shirts and an outstanding price,2
great fit warm and perfect for outdoor cold weather will be purchasing again,2
lightweight,1
kinda chintzy but ill use it till it falls apart which probably wont be long color is pretty,1
i usually wear a 6 12 b i ordered these shoes and the toe box peep toe is snug now will it stretch out i just dont know the ankle strap is comfortable probably will return for a larger size or possibly wider i doubt the 7 would fit,1
see thru feels cheap wouldnt recommend,0
the hat is very cute the googles are plastic and rubber easy to move around for an older toddler to wear them it is great for our one year old its a hassle to keep the hat on and the googles in place overall happy with it but not worn as often as desired,1
ended up returning because sizing was off compared to what i expected i had actually purchased a size larger than my regular rings because when exercising my rings are too snug to wear but these ended up huge not just a little loose,1
it kept opening by itself,1
they run very narrow and small,1
the price is awesome especially for what you get glasses case cloth theres a bit of a weird glare in the lenses but i guess that comes with the price good purchase for this price point but next time will splurge for higher quality,1
poorly constructed tore just putting it on,0
very poor quality,0
really cute but in my opinion these arent true snow boots they dont seem that warm or waterproof theyre going back,1
bought for my bf because it said genuine leather but its pig skin so its a bit misleading doesnt feel like it will last long kind of thin it looks okay but for the price the quality should be better,1
this skirt is very cute and will look great with mary jane style heels and a button up shirt it fits well but is a little too long for me i am 58 and it comes almost to my ankles it is midcalf in the picture not sure how shorter girls will be able to wear it without rolling the top i plan on rolling it to be midcalf and it looks way better at that length the waistband is not sewn as well as it could be but otherwise the construction is good,1
the print is on backwards and the material on the shirts are tearing at the seams,1
this suit looks amazingwhen its not on me if the bottoms had been designed with the flexible 134 wide elastic im used to i probably would have kept it however the top edge of the bottoms cut into my abdomen and makes it look even worse than it already does even being high waisted it was also a much smaller fit than the other high waisted two piece suits i ordered through amazon lots of ripping noises just sticking one thigh through,0
cheaply made top,0
this watch is bigger than i thought it does not come with an instruction manual and there is no manual at timexcom for this particular model the instructions for other 34shock34 expedition watches mostly work for this watch it seems sturdy which is what i want,1
sent back didnt like the pattern,0
love these great look fit for amazing price only reason not 5 stars is because ive only had them a week so cannot comment on durability,2
videoidb3cb5b64175a86810a094fede18cfcea i have bought several magnet watch bands this by far is the worst there wrist band itself magnetic which mean its shrivels up like a worm and magnetized to itself the catch part has two magnetic strips which makes this accessory super hard to put on while on your wrist i have to wiggle my arm through once i mcgiver the insert hole area through the opposite end of the strip even with two hands its hard to put the catch through the insert hole,0
super cute design and good material my only complaint is that it fits to big on my head if you have long hair that is thick it may work for you,1
loved the colors but had to return as it was easily 2 sizes larger than other clothes the same size the fabric is also fairly heavy and i was looking for a nice summertime lounging outift,0
these are pretty cute but dont fit properly normally love skechers shoes as they are typically very comfortable unfortunately though both of these shoes say they are my size one shoe is clearly 12 size smaller than the other and therefore make these uncomfortable i do not typically have this problem with skechersbr br since it is only 12 size and im too lazy to return these ill wear them but not often i dont feel this is the sellers fault as this is clearly a manufacturing flaw,1
was a gift for a friend perfect beautiful distressed good quality she loved it,2
works great,2
the value is great but i didnt wear them because the posts had been painted black and the part where the clasp meets was chipped so you could see the silver part underneath made it look cheap also they were smaller than i thought but looked decently made otherwise personally wouldve liked the post to be silver returned,0
washed well very comfortablebr i did have to hem them,2
its so cute and the material is really soft but its also really tight through the bodice and super cropped i could barely get it onoff returned,1
bueno,1
i measured my hand as they stated hands measures at 85 so i bought large and the gloves swallowed my hands fingers too long and way too much space around my palm and knuckles,0
mi paquete dice entregado a un residente yo tengo cámara y a mi casa nada ha sido entregado,0
hoping it would be a nice case but the liner arrived separated from the case will be sending it back i ordered one for my wife and it seems ok,0
if youre curvy this aint the move,0
it is really cute but too short i gave it to someone,1
cute but fit weird,0
cheap fabric wrinkled and buckled on my legs looked very sloppy on size 12 was way too small even though thats what i wear fabric isnt good quality for the 50 price tag this no more than a 25 30 jeans from amazons choices of low tier clothing selections,0
cheap looking,0
not cheap quality great for the price looks beautiful,2
true fit for my 15 year old son good price also,2
these are really poor quality and will only lasted me about 5 months before the heal wore down the heal is hollow allowing water or small rocks to get into your shoe also the interior is a horrible synthetic material that doesnt breath and if you get these shoes wet once they will stink forever the leather is really cheap looking in person toobr br they do feel really comfortable write of the box like slippers and i like the colors and the way they lookbr br maybe these are good if you plan to drive to work and have a desk job in a carpeted office and can take them off for 6 out of your 8 hour work day but im going to just spend the money and buy quality american made boots from this point on i bought some chipawas a few months ago and dont regret it,0
sleeves we so baggy i was in shock,0
i love how comfortable this bra is super sticky and the price was perfect must have strapless bra,2
sizing is not true to size runs at least a full size smaller gave mine away instead of returning or reordering it is beautiful though just not true to size,1
if you are a small person like myself their sizes will not fit you material is mediocre but decent for the price,1
very happy soft and comfortable fits just great love the bad bunny logo very happy,2
the earrings came with one stud and one earring instead of two its not what i expected,0
i did not like the fact that these were tighter on the legs so fitting a pair of pants any kind would not be able to wear these these would only be good to wear as a cover up under pants or an extension to a dressskirt,0
i actually purchased these for my 77 year old mother because she has very narrow feet they fit her perfectly and the heel is just right the only issue is the ankle strap but that just takes getting used to they look very sexy on her lol,2
zippers broke after a month still usable but slightly annoying ok for price,1
little boys medium shouldnt be a 56,0
the tissue it was wrapped in was stuck to the lettering on the shirt tried to gently rub it off but the letters started to come off very disappointed as its a christmas gift,0
these fit nicely over my glasses and keep out the glare theyre cute although the red isnt a true redmore of a rusty red i will wear them any how,2
i ordered a 2x and it is not the standard 2x size,0
all the stitching was coming out returning,0
i like the pattern style of this shoe very much i have purchased sizebr 912 sketcher bobs before they fit perfectly this style however runs big i will never buy this brand again as they are going to charge me more than 10 to return,1
very disappointed bought it for our 6 year old granddaughters bday the first night the beads cracked she loved the bracelet and then cried because it broke made very poorly in my opinion,0
these would barely fit a child,0
it does help with the hats but still leaves hat very weak,1
the strings detach from the mask easily other than that mask is cool,1
i was expecting this item since february the 14th to use as a carry bag for a mini ipad though it was worth the time waiting it is a nice bag the item was send by surface mail and the shipping method for a lightweight package like this it was ridiculous one thing got me disappointed the 2 colours choice was between 34olive green34 and 34coffee34 and what got me to choose the 34coffee34 one was the 34genuine cowhide straps34 while the olive advertised as 34faux leather34 straps34 at last it arrived and the coffeecolour bag was fake leather also,1
my son loves the design,2
i liked the color but the socks were not the same size on one pairi bought two pairs also i had expected them to be longer up to the knee both pairs were more like crew socks i bought the green unisex socks they sell i love the green pairs i bought two pairs fit well and long under the knee i am returning the pink pairs,0
fit like shirt and im tall will keep because i like it,0
forgot i had a bra on when got ready for bed it is the best bra ever,2
high end quality and finish at first thought the bags might be too small but you can really pack them they fit really well in my large suitcase and if you buy a second set you can fill both halves of the case without clothes or other items moving around really happy with the purchase,2
shirt is marked xxl actual size xl,0
appears to be good quality have not worn it yet time will tell fair price,2
loved the look and fit of this jacket im a busty smallmedium ordered medium and it fit perfectly but it is so thin not insulated at all and certainly not suitable for a michigan winter might be warm enough as a fall jacket or if you live in a very mild climate because it really doesnt add much more warmth than a heavier sweater,0
not bad if you add it to a gift basket appears cheap,1
pretty orange comfortable material normally wear 1416 purchased xl should have ordered l great for layering,2
some of mine came bent and tarnished,1
theres a weird sort of elastic around the middle of the sock where your arch would rest and it always catches my toe nails when im putting these things on always,1
nice but its half size too small,1
they were supposed to be crew socks but when put on they just about reach the knee the material is not as expected either not happy with them but my husband will wear them until we find ones we like will not order again,0
no good easily ripped after a couple months see photos for detail,0
i was shocked when these arrived as they are tiny not even wearable for me also i got 3 pair 1 for my daughters also and only half of the earrings were useable didnt fit in the clasp or were sharp i was very disappointed,0
got these thinking they would be great for bicycling use but they are more of a running sock seem to be good for that use the color is bright like neon glow in the dark bright,1
very cute but they are too small,1
ok sport coat tons of wrinkly whatever ok sport coat tons of wrinkly whatever ok sport coat tons of wrinkly whatever i paid for it i have it you did not gave me a chance to saythis in a form,0
good price very pretty,2
pretty necklace but rose fell off easily,1
its a little tinier than i expected but i love it since my bracelet is older style i clip the rope ring off to place the charm onto a split ring absolutely adorable and i love that the color is actually an enamelpaint versus a sticker which you usually ended up with for this price pointbr br 1010 would recommend,2
