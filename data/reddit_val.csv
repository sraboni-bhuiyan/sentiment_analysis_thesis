gameofthrones,laughing out loud is that your only shorty remark how many do you have to throw such judgment around grrm already stated that 90 of this season will be accurate to his ending so lets get this straight the nk is only show related as on the books its the army of the dead so right there its already a massive cut from the book dd were the ones that decided that arya was going to kill the nk so just because you consult with source writer does not mean this is the way it actually plays out in the source material so in fact arya might not even kill the nk in the book so your culmination is only based on the show not on the source material now do you really think grrm would create such a shallow narrative for such a complex character based on his work again the answer is no so if youre truly interested in the show being based on actual source material this was a coup out that worked poorly in the picture of this story,0,2

worldnews,gtfuck off more venezuelans already die murdered every 4 months than people have died and how did they die were they killed by soldiers like in libya or did they starve or die because of a lack of medicine caused by the us sanctions ive seen the same propaganda tactic used in syria where neocons would say assad killed 400000 of his people while ignoring the fact that the us gave billions of dollars to violent jihadist terrorists to cause chaos in syria and topple assad blame all the deaths on maduro despite 99 of them being caused by external factors amp gt uscentric conspiracy theories how fucking stupid do you have to be to believe that this isnt another us regime change war exactly like that of syria and yemen are you one of those people who clap when the us government calls leaders like maduro dictators despite being friends with actual dictators like the one in saudi arabia amp gt why do you not talk about how the cuban government yes i will talk about how the cuban government has given the largest amount of doctors to venezuela to help the country at a time when the us is putting heavy sanctions to starve and genocide the population i will also talk about china giving hundreds of millions of dollars in aid medicine and food despite us warning of sanctions on chinese companies i love how youre so mad at china and cuba for doing their best to help venezuelans get through these hard times while you and bolton are frustrated that the us strategy to starve as many venezuelans as possible isnt working out amp gt i will repeat it once again gtthe discontent with the bolivarian government saw the opposition being elected to hold the majority in the national assembly of venezuela for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 parliamentary election as a result of that election the lame duck national assembly consisting of bolivarian officials filled the supreme tribunal of justice with their allies6 gt gtfollowing months of unrest surrounding the recall referendum against president maduro in 2016 on 29 march 2017 the bolivarian supreme tribunal of justice ruled that the national assembly was in a situation of contempt because of the aforementioned rulings against the election of some of its members it stripped the assembly of legislative powers and took those powers for itself which meant that the court would have been able to create laws  amp youre clearly not educated on the issue at all the fact that you also support these sanctions on your own people shows your true nature that you put politics over the very lives of your own people,0,1

politics,my input started with this comment relating this story to information on rachel maddows show about the situation in her show she mentioned the situation with mueller and the doj stonewalling and that congressional leaders have said that if mueller is prohibited from testifying that house leaders have said publicly theyll issue a subpoena for mueller to appear the thread also got in a back and forth about whether or not mueller would be a private citizen soon  in which case he could appear if he wanted to if he was still employed though  and a subpoena was issued and the dems talking about issuing the subpoena made no distinction of whether he was still employed or not then why couldnt he just ignore it since the order to not comply would be illegal because hes legally required to obey it my question was assuming he had not left doj yet when i made the comment i thought i was on that same thread  where the question would have been understood since most of us had seen the rm show talking about it it didnt make sense when i mistakenly put it as a standalone comment so thanks for pointing that out rather than delete it i edited it to make more sense,0,2

asoiaf,i thought asha was so successful specifically because she used throwing weapons and so neutralized the sizestrength advantage of most of her male opponents before they got to her and also enjoyed so much success because she was a pirate ironborn rather than a soldier and so spent most of her time earning respect by slaughtering and stealing from peasants and merchants rather than clashing with trained soldiers and almost always started her fights with surprise attacks ill have to go back and reread her stuff because after writing all that out i can really feel how much i assumed about her character xd i kind of skimmed her parts in the book but i always assumed her success was a combination of her being a greyjoy native to the islands so she got training and some starting respect and the iron islands being the kind of place where you actually gain even more respect for bullying the weak men may be stronger on average but a pro female mma fighter is still going to clean plenty of clocks if you consistently put her up against normal untrained dudes in the books asha definitely fits the fantasy warrior girl trope way better than arya book arya is actually an assassin instead of just some fantastic allround warrior but in the show no matter how i like the actress that title goes to arya the show version of asha yara is a pirate captain who was almost always shown to get kills via stealthsurprise and who loses her first fight against a notable character euron in fact euron showed up and just straight up whopped the ass of every single female warrior in the series but arya and brienne leaving only those two vying for the top stop but all your points about briennes qualities and how they are even more exaggerated in the books makes her immune leaving only arya and given last episode and how much the showrunners love the character theres a good chance shes going to be instrumental in taking down the mountain as well he is on her list after all which could be the final nail in the coffin,0,2

nfl,nhl at one point gave regional priority to free agents imagine that heres your answer gtas background stan kostka had a huge college career as a university of minnesota running back leading the minnesota gophers to an undefeated season in 1934 every nfl team wanted to sign him since there was no draft back then savvy stan did the smart thing  he held out for the highest offer while a free agent stan kept busy even running for mayor of inver grove heights minnesota although his political career did not take off stans ninemonth nfl holdout succeeded and he became the leagues highestpaid player signing a 5000 contract with the nfls team in brooklyn new york on august 25 1935 as a response to the bidding war for stan kostka the nfl instituted the draft in 1936,0,2

asoiaf,but why should it go along with your expectations if it did then none of the cool stuff that made the show great would have happened the unsullied are known for being an unbreakable wall the dothraki have never failed at a charge they are fighting shambling undead they didnt expect them to be so overwhelmingly strong which is a totally in line with the narrative outcome the undead outnumbered them at least 101 hiding behind trenches wouldnt have done anything meaningful better to control the ground and rely on the 2 trump cards that never failed in the history of the world but in typical got fashion they failed spectacularly this episode was about failure and desperation you all wanted some hollywood battle where they slog away and eventually get breached then there is an epic fight against the white walkers with a bunch of the main characters dying and one of them dramatically taking out the nk but then wtf happens with the rest of the show this battle was never going to be the conclusion it has always been about who will rule the world also before having further criticism about motivations for certain actions id rather wait a few more days to see what happens after that super abrupt ending,0,0

nba,when you have time to get set and balanced then yeah his shot is more up and down but most of his contested 3s are stepbacks so its really common even for great shooters to overcompensate the momentum of going backwards and end up going like 3 more inches forward then their set shot thats most of the difference here when it comes to up and down vs jumping forward is it exaggerated to draw a foul hell yeah i dont think theres any disputing that hes trying to draw fouls on his jump shot it gets the opponent in foul trouble and gives you free throws its the same concept when you drive to the basket  initiate contact and draw the foul then finish harden is really great at doing this but its pronounced because hes so effective at drawing fouls on the perimeter the best ever arguably,0,0

freefolk,gtjon to not even see his arch nemesis of 8 seasons die after all this build up was disappointing thats kinda of the point the show didnt have jon somewhere else on the battle just cause he had jon constantly trying to chase him down but getting denied because forcing that showdown would be cliched and dumb on the part on the nk jon literally had a dragon v dragon showdown with the night king but yall are acting like they never saw each other on the battlefield at all gtbut jon also has a massive thematic connection to the night king not really thematically more so only narratively also worth mentioning that bran actually has the strongest connection to the night king both narratively and thematically and considering he put everything in place eg giving arya the dagger at the very same place he got to use his skill set to take down the night king in his own version of a showdown,0,2

todayilearned,essentially chess sudoku and crossword puzzles are np situations and each resists easily being solved however np is not equal to p because getting np to p requires input of information adding information to the puzzle being solved helps solve it the more information added in most cases the easier the crossword adding letters and words amp sudoku adding numbers solves the problems thus solving np requires adding information to find solutions and so the shannon it information content of np is not equal to p of which the latter must be greater how do physicians make diagnoses is yet another np problem we add information to solve those problems as well by doing testing rechecking the patients for patterns and careful examinations and histories,1,0

politics,after decades of subpar results its really amazing how confident people are in fundamentalsbased presidential election projections especially ones based entirely on the economy sure theres correlation the state of the good economy and a presidents reelection but its not the only factor and the economy itself is fairly complex and multifaceted in a way that isnt captured so simply by a binary good or bad judgement having 90 or whatever approval among republicans is also not particularly meaningful 93 of republicans voted for romney in 2012 and 92 of democrats voted for obama obviously the former didnt lead to a romney victory the vast majority of people who identify with a party vote for that partys presidential candidate regardless of whether or not they approve of them although the vast majority of them tend to do that too this is not a shocking or new phenomenon and you dont win elections by running up the margins among the people who were always going to vote for you anyway,0,2

politics,gtyes go look at just about any wapo article from the time just admit you have nothing gtno false equivalence we are currently showing him there are no repercussions for his crimes he may lose an occasional court battle but just rename the muslim ban and it goes through same w transmilitary members just keep screaming and he wins this is absolutely a false equivalence attempt a really bad one at that nobody that has been paying attention would seriously believe democrats are not trying to hold people accountable in addition to holding people accountable people also want them to legislate this is what they have been doing they have ramped up their investigations theyve had public hearings that have been all over the news im guessing you missed all that gtdemocrats are largely against impeachment especially pelosi who is the leader of the house she could have absolutely made a statement based on all current evidence we are going to proceed with impeachment proceedings as soon as we tie up some knowledge loose ends while it is a threat to national security delay these hearings we feel it is a bigger threat to not root out all crimes and criminals associated with this threat in the government now youve said impeachment is happening and we have enough but we want more instead shes come out against it to date youre lying again do you have proof that pelosi is coming out against it gt1 impeachment will not fail if it does it highlights the fact that the parties are too similar and unwilling to protect our nation and too busy playing politics to do their job as i originally said if it does happen it moves to the senate where the gops antiamerican behavior can be put on display as the senate trial is very publicized impeachment could very well fail actually its very likely it will with republicans in control of the senate you know that otherwise you wouldnt try to justify the alternative the gops antiamerican behavior has been on display for years already we dont need a symbolic impeachment for that we can continue having people testify under oath and broadcast it to the nation this is what would happen if impeachment started today anyways wouldnt you agree i cant believe youre actually advocating democrats enter a botched impeachment process without regard of the outcome i prefer a smart and strategic approach like the one democratic leaders are pursuing donald trump deserves to be impeached to try to impeach him when theres little chance of success is a disservice to this country impeach him when it will matter otherwise continue hurting him in the eyes of the public and get ready for 2020 we need to strategize long term gtit would not help trump it would hurt the gop as a whole it will help us get rid of him in 2020 you want democrats to go through an impeachment process that will result in no consequences to donald trump you also try to make the case this will help us somehow these two concepts are at odds with each other my guess is that momentum for impeachment will continue increasing if we get to the breaking point the democratic leadership will go for it and i will fully support them if public support remains low most likely theyll continue exposing trumps crimes all the way until 2020 hurting his chances of reelection severely this will give us a better shot at retaking the senate as well we will have the house the white house the senate and we can hold trump and his administration fully accountable free of any political hindrance this the gops worst nightmare this is what they want to avoid at all costs and they will if leaders listen to reactionary suggestions like yours,0,1

gameofthrones,it was the only way to kill him he purposefully doesnt make himself vulnerable to 1v1 combat unless overwhelming odds are in his favor he did make himself vulnerable against jon and dany many times in the dragon fight scene also why does a guy who has literally waited for thousands of years even have to rush in to kill bran by himself physically before they even had won the fight also i thought wights and shit fighted non stop until everyone was dead well guess what every important person is alive how is that possible with non stop waves of wights running at them for 1 hour they even was at the front line when the tsunami of dead came in the dragon which crash landed just like viserion is alive the dragon that got hijacked by 100 wights is alive the plot armor made this episode so shit also why do they even bother showing us how nk was made if we dont go further he smiles after they try to burn him with dragon fire so he has to be somewhat human but no having us knowing what these mythical creatures really wanted and their motivation was just stupid right like show us who he was does he have any family ties why is he doing this have a small dialogue why he made this circle of limbs all over the place what is the deal about that they just threw all of that right out the window when he gets stabbed maybe he could turn into a human again i would love that if this is the end of white walkers then fuck me this series just got fucked right in the bum which i am sure he is hopefully there is some backstory to be explained in the next episodes,0,1

leagueoflegends,how is it damage control to have never actually announced a taliyah skin and then admit that no they hadnt planned one im pretty sure the misconception that they had one planned comes from when they announced that the players from ssg had picked her for a skin she was never in the list of champions they announced were getting skins they announced skins for tons of other champions that could use them arguable more than taliyah though like shen and heimer amumu etc all of them got skins last year riot has clearly shown that they act on what they say when it comes to skins for these kinds of champs they literally said when they released them that variants were a bit of an experiment that they wanted to do to test the waters on they were inspired by the mountain of fan art made for those kinds of things and so they sat down and did the work same amount of work that youd do for a 750 rp skin which as theyve said they arent very keen on giving fans lowerquality skins especially not when theyre skins that are only a remodel of a different skin they dont want to release 750 rp skins and be like yep this is what you get take it or leave it see you in two years riot isnt sitting around scheming about how many lux skins theyre trying to push out no ones whining about how lulu and soraka also got skins last year most people dont even care that miss fortune who literally got an ultimate skin got one miss fortune and ezreal have literally had the most skins in the game until now but who do people meme about getting skins lux and ahri they never said that every champion has to have every single one of their skins be super unique and diverse and that none of a champions skins cant be similar they said that they would be skipping over certain events and themes last year in order to do some different ones like odyssey its just so petty i love kindred they were the character that got me into league in the first place id love for them to get a new skin but im also not mad every time lux or someone else gets a skin and they dont,0,1

gameofthrones,that castles pretty small and i dont think it could have hosted many people that said they shouldnt have been where they were as you said they should have been engaging the enemy during its entire advance the dothraki riders could have been out there picking off wights from horseback for days doing runandgun attacks the dead didnt seem equipped for any sort of ranged attack and the remaining unsullied and anyone else outside of the castle and defense perimeter should have been staged somewhere else so they can attack the flanks and rear of the army this would require many of the dead to turn and fight which would subtract from the horde moving forward it forces the dead to fight on multiple fronts which breaks up their strategy of being one singular wave that washes over everything the battle of helms deep in lotr is a great example the advancing army was attacking a fortification and had overwhelming numbers like what happened here the attack from the rear changed everything now the grand plan is shattered and theres coordination chaos an army with a singular purpose has to adapt to changing tactics winterfell still would have lost of course but it would have been nice to see some clever tactics be employed even if they failed before the end what we witnessed was basically the worst strategy possible,0,2

The_Donald,gtwell thats how capitalism worksand the large amount of unskilled labor jobs in which no one wants to do amp japan has been rearing children below replacement rate for more than 3 decades its not capitalism caused and unlike what i read in usa ive been to japan twice and talk to their people ive 15 years japanese learning and unlike usa system it seems to me their freelancer has a much more livable wage and more reliable shifts than usa a convinence store hourly wage is 1000 yen in tokyo and you could have eaten till youre very full healthily at 250 yen at chain stores 15 mins of work for your meal right on the same busy street you work in if nothing else id say capitalism is reliving japan of its dire population situation right now amp if these mexicans are able to steal your doctor jobs then there is something wrong with the usa once they start stealing your educated jobs lol gtsince education is lacking for trade skills in the usa people are becoming lazy and entitled without any work ethics the next gen of people will want a higher form of socialism considering that we have a mix of capsocial this latter part i can partially agree though though for healthcare sector i lean towards the broken system that totally subverted capitalism i mean the red tape insurance in intransparent dealing between hospitals and big pharma,0,2

Animemes,gtwhen asked if he ever tried to prove his innocence he said he never bothered since he assumes that there is no way they will ever believe him im fairly certain this is anime only i vaguely remember this in the ln and im fairly certain he does try to prove his innocence several times and im pretty sure he tells that to fittoria i could be remembering poorly admittedly gthe makes no attempts to reconcile or attempt to show he is a good person disagreed he may pass it off as greed but he constantly shows hes a good person yes he asks people for payment for saving them but deep down thats for two reasons 1 he needs funds to fight the waves 2 he doesnt want them to feel like they owe him number two is important the payment he asks for is never too much for the people and it always makes them even in everyones eyes in one case he took a pass that showed he was a merchant in another he asked for food in a different one he just asked for what they would have payed the other heros then gave half that to the doctor in yet another he took essentially garbage gtscourns those who doubt him and leaves to be by himself so what was he supposed to do in melromarc leaving alone was literally his only choice gtthe only reason he initially trusts his complains is because of a slave pact and that he knows they have no reason to betray him again so in that world slavery is still a thing and accepted at varying degrees unlike our world where its mostly gone and most people think its bad yes there are still some countries that allow it gtcalling him an increadible hero is kind of a stretch how so he can differentiate between his personal hatred and a person who doesnt deserve saving he risks his own life to save people he hates repeatedly he can even work past his hatred of the royal family to help melty sure it takes a bit of help but thats not a demerit of being a hero being a hero doesnt mean doing everything on your own being a hero doesnt even mean saving everyone gtwhat makes the shield a true hero its the same as what makes him a perfect hero a perfect hero isnt a hero without flaws or a hero that can save everyone thats not being a hero thats being a god what makes a hero perfect is being able to differentiate between personal hatred and a person who doesnt deserve to be saved not everyone deserves to be saved what makes a hero perfect is saving everyone you can even if you hate them what makes naofumi a perfect hero is him risking his own life to save people he hates when he could very well just not do anything when summoned by the waves what makes him a perfect hero is protecting the three morons who call him completely useless yet still a cheater what what makes him a hero is going so far above and beyond he is all but forcing miracles into happening what makes him a hero is the fact he never truly gives up his i dont care fuck you all personality is a facade that he puts up to protect himself its not who he is inside naofumi is a true and perfect hero he is not a god,0,2

AmItheAsshole,so before i reply to most of the content of your reply i think its probably important to point out that we may just be having a semantic disagreement when it comes to the sexism aspect i think generally more progressive people tend to use the words like sexism and racism more loosely than less progressive people so as to have a way to talk about lessobviously discriminatory things like institutional and implicit racism and sexism i would categorize any ignorance that hurts a minority because youre in a majority that doesnt have to deal with x a bias insert female sexuality subtle race issues etc for x so in this case im not trying to vilify op for being ignorant im just saying i believe that being ignorant about female sexuality is a result of a system that has made female sexuality taboo and that he has sexist biases as a result to me it doesnt mean op is an asshole automatically or is a bad person just that he should try to get less ignorant on groups that may not have the same privilege as him i think in regard to the sexism thing were pretty much saying the same thing just in different words now as for your actual reply lol sure boys can and do injure themselves at a young age and i also think thats a thing that needs to be addressed  sexuality for anyone is shamed in our society to some extent and results in kids not getting educated on things that would keep them sexually safe and yes some boys need external stimulation but id guess thats a pretty small minority and im more focused on general trends there will always be exceptions like that but i think focusing on that small minority might be keeping us from having a more meaningful discussion on the trend of shaming and not discussing female sexuality much more than male sexuality as for whether starting to explore sexuality warrants a sex toy idk if the kid wants it and thats how they want to explore their sexuality i dont really see a problem with it considering its way safer than alternatives ie read the horror stories of electric toothbrushes in this post also i think theres a massive difference between a girl having a vibrator to explore her own body with and watching two adults have sex especially given that a plain vibrator doesnt have anything phallic i dont see how this would change her expectations of sex and if it potentially could all the more reason to talk about it shes going to find something that vibrates regardless might as well have it be something much safer than household objects and have her parents know so any unrealistic concepts about sex that could develop can be proactively addressed i think as long as the vibrators are all certified as nontoxic or whatever she doesnt really need help picking one thats kind of part of the exploration here imo therere certainly safety guidelines her mom could give without actually picking one out for her,0,0

apexlegends,the fact that respawn didnt take action absolutely doesnt mean they condone that or that its not important it doesnt mean anything it just means respawn probably noticed the problem and didnt have the time to block the cvars or even that they didnt have the time to communicate on that gt if they ban people out of nowhere it can paint a negative image without effective communication exactly with communication its a non issue they could legitimately say we banned cheaters that were using cvars to get an unfair advantage over other players this will affect respawn image from the cheaters in question but i dont think any player that never got banned will say anything negative about this its not like they would ban borderline cheaters that use some minor macro to empty for inventory or some anecdotal minor helper they would ban people that purposefully gained an unfair advantage by tweaking the game outside of normal settings gt it can be harder to understand the exact modifications to a game file and how it affects the gameplay when it comes to removing specifically smokes in game its intentional and there is definitely a purposeful attempt to cheat its not something you can do without really understanding how nefarious it is every single players that uses this specific modification knows its only for him and it gives him an advantage most other players wont have cvars users are cheaters they are not lesser cheaters they are not nicer cheaters they are not grey cheaters they are players that purposefully decided to cheat and they deserve the very same sanction an aimbot user would receive a ban gt wow just banned many folks that were modding game models please dont use unrelated examples this is indeed a debatable ban but removing smoke specifically in apex is i think you would agree not a debatable attempt of cheating the vast majority of players seeing this the first time would definitely say that it is cheating its not modding characters in a completely different game gt if someone is modding the cvars to turn every blue beacon to bright pink to help their colorblindness should we ban them or understand that they were trying to compliment the ingames colorblind settings that are underdeveloped i was specific for smokes removal and i still am there is specific cvars that can only be used to cheat or for debug purposes exclusively at respawn the smoke one is definitely one of them based on that would you consider banning players using this specific tweak to be cheaters deserving a ban  yes or no  its a simple question ps oh and by the way when a player modifies cvars for smokes he is definitely infringing on contracts he signed to access to the game the terms of service always include something that says that modifying the game to gain an unfair advantage is not authorized and its usually worded in a manner that leaves it to the appreciation of respawn they can legitimately ban these players and tell them you signed a contract to play this game and didnt respect the terms you are banned,0,1

gameofthrones,ill offer a bit of input but ill preface this by saying im also not willing to argue with you because its very clear youve already made up your mind on this nevertheless in any battle formation some part of your army has to be on the front lines the dothraki were chosen to be on the front lines likely because they have been touted many times in the show and in the books to be extremely sufficient in combat on horseback strategically their job is to rush plain and simple so thats what they did maybe they left earlier than expected maybe jorahs look was an oh shit this is really happening moment either way it was happening like that regardless expecting the unsullied take the first wave would leave the dothraki with no momentum to charge unless they came in from the side like someone mentioned which would have been smarter but i imagine the plan was for them to try to cut down as many as they could in the initial charge and hope there were less for the unsullied to deal with so whether you want to agree with me or not is your choice i dont have much else to say on the matter i enjoyed the episode i like to look at the big picture and be thankful that were definitey getting some form of ending to the story that we can only sit and hope gets a book ending as well im excited for that possibility as i am excited for the shows final three episodes,0,2

movies,two off the top of my head kermodes loathing for under the silver lake and the entire racial discussion of three billboards outside of ebbing missouri i find utsl to be immensely dense and overall a critique of the negative influence media has had on us over the years its a film about the meaninglessness of media and the the horrible behaviors and ideologies that hollywood and music has normalized through film i think most criticisms of the film its bad portrayal of women and the unlike ability of sam as a protagonist are just reinforcing this idea i dont understand the controversy around three billboards treatment of race a lot of the critics seem to miss the point that the casual racism is meant to portray the hatefulness of dixon and the comedy around that hatefulness is just how mcdonagh likes his comedy dark a lot of critics also criticized the film for letting dixon be redeemed but i dont think the film redeems him at all the man lost everything and is permanently disfigured he shows the capacity to change yes but he is in no way redeemed,0,2

gameofthrones,honestly even i enjoyed most parts of the episode while it lasted but once i actually started to think about the things that had happened in the episode i started to feel so disappointed there were so many paths they couldve taken but they chose the laziest one and having our heroes fight with the ww before arya finishing the nk off when the situation is really heated would certainly be more satisfying but i still think bran shouldve had a bigger role on this i wanted the writers to explore and utilize more of his powers and that too i wanted after watching the episode and not because i had a theory or something i mean the dudes entire arc was basically him being the 3er he has the closest ties to the nk out of any other character i just dont see much of a purpose of him now that the nk has died and i agree that grrm shouldve at least released one of books till now but dampd are the ones leading the expedition now so i dont really see how theyre not the ones to be blamed grrm only provided the basic outline of how he imagined his story coming to an end the majority of the script and everything else was their own doing grrm was only there to give advice when asked for and in a recent interview i watched he mentioned that dampd dont always come to him for his advice and theyve done many things without his knowledge they are basically the ones with the control over the show they shouldve known what they were getting into before they accepted the job in the first place and they couldve had other writers help them but they chose to do it themselves the show is still engaging ill give them that but the writing has really gone downhill what other being do you think is more powerful than the nk if he isnt the most powerful how are dragons more powerful than him and i agree that hes not invisible but hes the closest to being invisible well he was shown to be before he was killed in a sneak attack,0,2

AmItheAsshole,nta if you hadnt discussed this prior to marriage your ex would be correct he would have the right to teach his son his beliefs although teaching him homophobia would still be wrong but you both agreed to raise your child as not religious before you had him that agreement should stand that said being muslim is a part of your sons heritage and culture as you are not the only parent and your son will be exposed to islam he will spend some of his time in an islamic house its reasonable to expect your ex to follow the agreement but unreasonable to expect him to hide his beliefs so theres no way to shelter him from religion your ex shouldnt actively try and convert your son but if your son asks questions of course your ex will answer and he should if your attitude is no way in hell will my kid be a muslim it may backfire your son may turn out religious i ended up leaving christianity for a different religion and it was a huge strain on my relationship with my mom who couldnt accept it it didnt help that i came out as bi a little later and she kept wondering what she couldve done differently not realizing at some point it was my personal decision and she was damaging our relationship by treating me as an extension of herself that said your son isnt at that age yet where its a personal decision and you have every right to keep a non religious household,1,0

news,following the christchurch shooting and the news that nz would be changing its gun laws i commented how glad i was and i ended up getting some pretty alarming messages from progun americans based on post history who genuinely believe that having a gun on you means youll instantly diffuse the situation and save everyones lives edit since some people seem to take issue with this view i should have put a disclaimer saying i am from new zealand id also like to say that the alarming messages included death threats so ya know not exactly looking too favourable on that topic currently to answer one of the most debated things here you can look at the use of guns in two ways they act as a deterrent or they escalate if we take the first road owning guns act as a deterrent because the threat of harm will prevent offensive action being taken this is the exact same view that some countries have towards nuclear weapons and is equally a contentious topic your neighbour owns a gun so therefore you are less likely to burgle him because he might shoot you right but what if you too had a gun and you bring it with you now youve got two offensive weapons and an incredibly dangerous situation this is a likely outcome if you are legally allowed to own them the second road is what lead to the cuba missile crisis and shockingly the reason that it was deescalated was through diplomacy and the removal of the jupiter missiles from turkey and debatably italy too the fact that the us had a vastly superior arsenal did not factor into either sides decisionmaking process the removal of the weapons guns if we drop the analogy lead to a deescalation of tensions the likelihood of someone shooting you is dramatically decreased if guns are illegal or far more tightly regulated yes there will be cases where one person has a gun and the other is unarmed and dies as a result but those are the outliers and are such a minuscule amount of cases,1,0

todayilearned,gtthe 6 minutes is for all systems including auxiliary systems and to make sure everything is good its not a physical limitation of the engine i never stated otherwise and if i implied it that was not my intent however if the engines didnt require a warmup you could tow the aircraft and test all the auxiliary systems via a hookup with its own presumably more fuel efficient power source like the auxiliary motor on a tank the question that started this chain was why aircraft were not towed and warming up the engine is a key reason why gtby the time a jet engine is started the oil has been pumped through the engine several times like i said idle speed alone is 90 of full thrust rpm again can you please provide a source any source that goes into that level of detail is one i need to improve my own knowledge in this area im not claiming to know everything or that you are wrong as long as we agree theres a warmup period then i dont think youve been wrong in this chain regarding the oil when this is done for a piston aircraft such as with the m6a seiran preheaters on the i400 and i13 class submarines it also dramatically cuts the time down i cant check the respective reports at present but as i recall it reduced the total prep time to about five minutes per aircraft excluding assembly gtthat 30 seconds includes winding up from 0 rpm which is most of the time i can see that especially if the oil is preheated and pumped through the system before starting the engine gtyou need to watch agentjayz on youtube will do thank you for the recommendation i likely wont have a chance to watch one of his videos before you reply so mine will be delayed,0,1

savvy but oh who kills merrin trent and littlefinger arya jon is born an outsider while he lives a life of relative warmth and comfort he is reminded daily he doesnt belong there the first chance he gets he forsakes his family and joins the night watch a group of societys outcasts he is immediately branded as an outsider eventually he is seen as a good leader a decent fighter and a loyal friend he spends the next several years fighting for his life almost every day he has to watch his friends die struggle with the politics of leadership and make the choice between a woman he loves or his vows he chose his vows which leads to her being killed in front of him he is thrust into a leadership role he doesnt want as leader he is faced with a supernatural force that threatens to wipe out all life on his planet he chooses to make peace with the wildlings for the greater good the realm he is murdered by his own men for this decision the only reason he is brought back to life is so that arya can kill the nights king his reward he got to fuck his aunt bran is thrown from a fucking tower because he saw something he shouldnt have he is now paralyzed from the waist down he is thrust into a leadership but before he could object he is betrayed by someone he considered family he has to watch his own subjects be beaten and killed in front of him while he is powerless to do anything he eventually escapes and sets out on a hellish journey across the north where everyday could be his death he not only has to watch friend almost be raped the rest of crew die protecting him his reward nothing as he basically died when the ter took over his body so far the only part he has played in the story was giving a dagger to arya so she could kill the nights king arya took sword fighting lessons from the greatest sword fighter who has ever lived for a few weeks after school during the 6th grade shes now a master sword fighter because of that after after not seeing her father and teacher die she kinda dicks around westeros for a few years in relative safety during this time period the worst things that happens to her is she has to say good bye to her boyfriend and has to sleep outside for a couple days until tywin fucking lannister saves her he also some how trains to be a master tactician even though the only thing shes sees is him yelling because he is losing every single battle she also happened to save an almost invincible super magic ninja that will kill whomever she wants and will also train her to become an almost invincible super magic ninja because finding a magic lamp would be way to obvious after she gets tired of the bohemian life style she decides to enroll in assassins college tuition free of course there she is taught to lie really well clean dead bodies and how to fight in the dark oh and she is also taught to be an almost invincible super magic ninja even though we never see her training we just assumed thats where she learned it because its expected after she got what she wanted from killer community college she immediately betrays them twice for purely selfish reasons while on the run from an insanely power guild of assassins she walks around town like she isnt on the run from an insanely powerful guild of assassins in a moment of clarity she forgets all of her training and is stabbed in the stomach thankfully the woman she saved earlier has a phd in fixing getting stabbed in the stomach arya makes a full recovery in like 7 hours after the greatest doctor in the history of bravos is killed arya is confronted by her former teacher arya leads her into a trap of fighting in the dark i guess that was the first semester they taught fighting in the dark and the person who taught her how to how fight in the dark doesnt know how to fight in the dark thus proving every smug asshole who ever said those can do those who cant teach right now that she has complete control of her emotions and total mastery of a 1000 year old school of assassination she formally leaves bravos to return to westeros where she will effortlessly solve everyones problems it took two armies a giant almost dying and deus ex knights of the vale to for jon to defeat ramsey it took arya some wine and some pies to completely obliterate the entire house of frey she beat littlefinger a literal mastermind with a forged note it would be too obvious for jon to defeat the nights king even though thats what his entire character arc has been about no we have to subvert your expectations so the magic shape shifting antifa super soldier who can fly now will kill the nights king completely robbing jon of any growth or vindication for the many many sacrifices he made to get to this point because coherent story telling doesnt matter only surprises unless the character is arya then its okay to be 100 fairy tale bullshit oh also arya is like the only character to have a completely healthy two way sexual relationship without any baggage what so ever,1,0

relationship_advice,i personally think there is no point in being close friends with her apparently she doesnt see her boyfriend as badly as you do and you simply cant change her mind its better for you to back up because 1 thats so much negativity in your life in my opinion and 2 its hella stupid that she doesnt make time for you  that leads me to the thinking that she doesnt care for you as much as you do im not saying to cut all the communication you two have but i think it will be better for you not to reach out for her find another person who will understand you and not ignore you because of their crappy boyfriend you dont want that negativity and pressure in your life trust me find someone who will make you feel chill and relaxed thats it,0,2

AmItheAsshole,ymassivelyta sexuality is one of the most complex and difficult subjects for young people to navigate by reacting negatively to your daughter actively experimenting sexually but doing so in a healthy and safe manner youre essentially guaranteeing she will later experiment in an unhealthy manner so my first thing is if your daughter god forbid experiences some sexuallyrelated misfortune like an sti unwanted pregnancy or even assault  you are now partially responsible by reacting as strongly as you have you have encouraged an incredibly unhealthy taboo towards sexual behavior youve taught your daughter to be ashamed of sex and by extension her own body and its desires heres what you have to do and this isnt a suggestion this is mandatory you will go to your daughter and explain to her that you were wrong that when you were raised it was a different time and that you were taught to be ashamed of sex you dont want her to feel that way and you insist that you are deeply sorry for your horrible behavior tell her that you encourage her to do anything she things she needs to do and that her mother will always be there to help her tell her that you have undermined your credibility and trustworthiness and that you are ashamed of yourself for how you behaved beg her for her forgiveness and ask if theres anything you can do to make it up to her explain to her that what shes doing is natural and that she should feel free to experiment but also explain that sexuality involves very powerful and complex emotions as an aside explain that this is in part why you reacted the way you did explain that you want her to experiment but she can do serious harm to herself and others if she is not careful ask that if shes ever unsure about what she should do or if its safe to do something she can talk to you or to your wife id also strongly recommend you put her in touch with her gynecologist directly and tell her that if she ever has any questions shes too embarassed to talk to you or her mother about the gyn is trained and paid to handle these things herself its far far more important to you that she is healthy and happy than it is for her to honor some misogynist code of sexual abuse towards women do all of this in front of her mother so that she knows that you are both on the same page and she will never get humiliated like this again if you dont understand why this is so important its because of those same powerful emotions you experienced when you saw she was thinking about masturbating youve now primed her for permanent psychological harm pray to whatever deity you value that what i prescribe is able to undo it,0,1

unpopularopinion,its social conditioning people have been trained to think that the only way to have fun as an adult is to be drinking its probably worse in america since our drinking age is 21 so its automatically seen as an adult thing to do for this reason people actually start drinking in their teens because kids are naive and just want to feel more mature by doing something they perceive as being adult starting at such a young age makes it an easy transition when you reach adulthood and can actually purchase and consume alcohol legally which probably makes it feel more refined for people which helps them convince themselves that doing the same things they did in high school is still a mature and adult thing to do in all reality alcohol is a multibillion dollar industry and they will do anything to convince people that drinking is normal which is why its all over pop culture and social media just like smoking its one of those things that we all as individuals know is terrible for us but we do it anyway because weve been conditioned to believe that we have to in order to fit in as someone who has never been a drinker because of an extensive family history of alcoholism its incredibly awkward sometimes being around close friends who insist on drinking any chance they get which is so crazy to me because why should i feel left out and abnormal for not wanting to drink literal poison as an adult this doesnt bother me nearly as much as it did when i was younger and i can easily just let my friends make their own decisions while i make mine but its still frustrating seeing all the people pointing out that it acts as a social lubricant to decrease theyre anxiety while ignoring the fact that its literally a toxic and unhealthy way to treat said anxiety like imagine if i tried to explain that i use cocainemethheroin to treat my social anxiety would anyone think thats normal but it just goes to show you how deeply ingrained the normalcy of consuming alcohol is in our society its fucked up honestly amp and i know if i tried to talk about this with people they would just call me an asshole and accuse me of thinking im better than them when thats not it at all this is just my perspective and i concede that i could be totally wrong and it has nothing to do with morals or being a good person its also a lot more nuanced than can be easily explained like there are a million reasons that someone could choose to drink on an individual level and generalizing it to the scope of a societal problem as a whole is hard to do when everyone will have their own perspective theres also the fact that drinking alcohol and other forms of intoxication go back hundreds of years in human history so its hard to argue that its not normal when we as a people have been actively trying to kill ourselves for all of this time maybe life really is just so unbelievably boring that well do anything to make it more exciting or die trying who knows,0,2

gameofthrones,because its not the fact that we _dont see everyone travel everywhere_ but the fact that if people are travelling they should either be shown as doing stuff while travelling being mentioned in passing during scenes that focus on other characters and show the passing of time or just absent from the spotlight entirely for a significant amount of time while events elsewhere take place that also show time is progressing so misrepresenting the issue people have with instant teleportation as we didnt see everyone traveling everywhere in the first seasons is you being a poor writer you fundamentally misunderstanding the issue people have with teleportation with more than ample examples of people explaining that it is in fact not about seeing every step someone takes but about internal consistency and a sense of realism is you being a bad reader,0,2

politics,gt impeachment in the house but failure to convict in the senate doesnt harm the democrat presidential candidate but it does harm future prosecutions of trump in a criminal court by creating a predisposition in future jury pools that he was found innocent impeaching him will be morally pleasing but unless there is a significant change of heart in the senate republicans it will be a pyrrhic victory at best but there absolutely should be congressional investigations even ones for the purpose of proving articles of impeachment because even if they decide not to vote on it they are creating mountains of evidence for prosecutors,0,0

leagueoflegends,this is just a copy from another comment i just posted but its about the exact same topic and your reply was the same as the other one so i hope youll excuse it oh i know and its definitely valid at least a lot more so than tsm svens cold hands from iem oakland 2016 ahah c9 definitely showed later on that they were way better than this but thats besides my point what matters in this discussion is the level they had in that specific series whatever the reason  gettig sick happens and can sadly happen again even if its not fair and is not representative of the true level of the team as you pointed out im just saying that weve seen in the past some very close series in the somewhat recent past 2 out of the last 3 times in play ins between na and the best wildcard teams sure there were some very logical explanations for it jensen was indeed sick and playing far below his level but the fact remains that some wildcards those as good as gam was have the potential to show up against some na teams not of the caliber of this years team liquid though in certain circumstances for instance i could definitely see a new gamlevel wildcard team beat the 3rd seed from na or hell even eu at worlds playins in a bo5 at some point in the future not necessarily this year or next year though well likely need a combination of the 3rd seed from said major region to be weak imagine 100 thieves last year if they were 3rd seed or performing poorly for whatever reason jensen being sick like last year and the wildcard team being good closer to the level of gam instead of the level of last years gambit who were straight up terrible but theres a big difference between the 3rd seed at worlds from na and the best team from na at msi especially with franchising being there teams are much more stable now and we have a basically allstar roster for the best team in na so i dont really see a wildcard beating them even in the future unless they progress tremendously or na has some very low year for some reason ps its the second time i have this exact same discussion same arguments exactly though not presented in the same order in the last two weeks on reddit last time ended up with me getting about 60 downvotes though people understood my point eventually i hope this time will turn up better ahah,0,1

Showerthoughts,yeah so depending on age and body type of your person and gender theres a bunch of different factors for losing your body fat youre probably going to have look at some stuff online for that but the method for fat loss is the same the human body has a required amount of calories depending on body factors mentioned above called maintenance calories which are the required amount of calories to keep your body from breaking down in order to lose fat you have to be in a caloric deficit this makes the body take the calories out of your body fat  fats literally just calories concentrated into cells for long term storage and use and there are a bunch of different methods of achieving this for most of my weight loss i used intermitted fasting which is eating at minimum is a 10 hour eating window at maximum without muscle loss 22 hours if you want it this bad that youll do 22 hours like i did nothing will stop you from your goal but its really rough and depending on how many hours and calories you decide on youll have to take vitamin supplements or use high nutrient foods i used kale spinach and eggs for the 22 hour and would recommend this every day even if you arent doing an extreme fast and watch calories and try to eat healthieralso dont use lettuce its a complete joke of a health food and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you i will also recommend just drinking nothing but water its an easy way to cut back on calories and eating after 8 pm should not even be up for discussion for cheatingbut depending on what youre doing or how fast you want it i would recommend you cheat and eat what ever you want but dont go over board i would recommend this for someone who doesnt have a lot of time and just wants to lose weight on to the second method which if you got 2 or 3 hours to spend this one my favorite out of the two running a bunch  i still recommend eating healthier and it will help you can start out where ever running apps arent a bad start but i would recommend something to track distance and calories and if you can run for every long just start out slow and work your way up at one point i couldnt even run 20 feet without running out of breath but now 10k a day or 68 miles and if you get sore just take a day off then hit it again tomorrow and try to increase your amount running why i mentioned the apps they really help per week month or whatever it takes but i would recommend this for people who cant control them selfs when they see delicious foods but if you do either of those and dont see results you should see a doctor about weight loss it could be something else holding you back but give it some time and buy a scale to keep track now on to the building muscles this requires high protein high carbs and high calories carbs and protein for rebuilding muscles and calories a boost in muscle growth the difference is huge for cal cut and cal surplus but i will say 70 of your gains are happening in the kitchen ratios depending on body fat are 11 protein 13 carbs the foods i would recommend for carbs are stuff like whole wheat bread  oats preferably with little to no sugar and rice white or brown protein leaner meats like chicken fish or any other low fat meat and protein shakes i would recommend whey protein power the calorie surplus will make you gain a little bit of fat but you can have a two week on one off where you go hard for two weeks of training three days out of the week and rest for four and the after two weeks cut for a week to keep body fat away you will not have to eat that much 200 to 500 over body maintenance calories and what ever calories you burn during workouts i do all my stuff at home with dumbbells pull up bar and a weight vest for workouts and progressively in crease weight to increase your muscle mass i think thats it so i hope this helps and if anyone reading this is a professional trainer please tell me if i missed anything or any way this can be improved also i dont claim to be any sort of professional this is just research ive done over time thanks reading,0,1

leagueoflegends,his damage already fell off considerably midgame thats not really the point of the champion  its to protect generally one specific ally or to chase and lock down enemies the reason to play tahm instead of another tank is because other tanks cant force an enemy to attack you to get to a specific target with the exception of taunts w a pretty short duration tahm can by lending an important target a large health pool at a key moment so they can then spring out of him with potentially several important cds wasted for the enemy team heres things tahm can do better with these changes aside from that weak slow he has a lot more inherent durability early on especially if you e max he will be able to make very efficient trades in laning phase he will be able to cross massive distances on the map during the mid to late game he will be able to eat champions more frequently early game allowing him more opportunities to save or lock down folks and what did he lose mobility during his eat so kidnapper tahm is dead and the death of an enemy championsafety of an ally champion isnt guaranteed poke damage off of his wgeneral waveclear which hurts mostly top lane tahm since his overall trading should still be strong in a duo lane and range on his early game ult which makes his rotations and objective control during the first 15 weaker imo its not that bad his play style will shift a bit but i dont think hes dead,0,1

ChapoTrapHouse,laughing out loud complete gibberish first of all the soviet union was itself an imperialist power forcibly occupying a dozen countries for most of its existence yes they aided antiimperialist movements elsewhere but they crushed the ones in their sphere of influence furthermore every imperialist power aids antiimperialist movements in the territories of its rivals the german empire sent lenin back to russia in 1916 and promised mexico aid in taking back territory that america had taken from it the us empire supports independence movements that undermine its rivals as well like the tibetan one this is how imperialists work they bolster their own empires and try to undermine rival empires second of all how the fuck are markets the big thing that matters to you you just completely ignored all the bread and butter shit i talked about environmental devastation mass incarceration suppression of labor unions and think that because the soviet economy demarketized major sectors that means it was therefore nothing like the american system markets vs nationalization is really an irrelevant issue what matters is the standard of living workers control of the economy and the peace and freedom people enjoy on all those accounts the soviet union was no better than the us,1,0

asoiaf,and thats what lazy writing is for me the fact that i personally hoped for them to somehow use the azor ahai prophecy was a personal desire of mine  but i could have accepted arya killing him if they would have somehow prepared the plot for it they could have prepared some things and i believe that still most people wouldnt have realized that arya would be the one to kill him i personally didnt even realize that she was the one when melisandre told her that line again  simply because i refused to believe that something as unexpected as that could happen amp and thats another issue of mine brienne is one of the best knights there are arya doesnt have enough experience to defeat her imo and still thats a 1v1 fight i could also understand the way she was killing those zombies as it closely resembled how she learned to fight with a stick but she lost that weapon her stealth skills also seem to be rather useless inside of the castle so i find it very difficult to believe that she got that close to nk with only a knife and stealth,0,2

gameofthrones,gt so she was bad until gasp she got good enough managed to beat a magical shape shifting faceless assassin thats called character development she developed over the course of 7 seasons so why are you acting like her abilities are an ass pull no she quite literally won after getting the shit kicked out of her by turning off the lights not because she was better than the waif there was never any indication that she was a particularly skilled great warrior so your sarcastic comment doesnt do anything but show how shitty you get to strangers online when they disagree with your opinion gtlmao what the weasleys were never exceptional the only one that really became anything exceptional was percy and thats why he distanced himself from the family what was rons great magical power what was ginnys or the twins what feats did their parents have molly killed bellatrix with a disarming charm the very definition of anticlimatic looks like you know harry potter even less than you do asoiaf here you are just completely wrong percy doesnt distance himself from his family because they arent magically gifted but because his father isnt viewed as ambition and is seen as a muggle lover bill weasley is a curse breaker for gringots a job that is described as being very dangerous and requiring newts to do bill and percy were head boys and charlie and ron were prefects at hogwarts charlie is a dragon wrangler which is also dangerous and needs powerful magic to keep him somewhat safe both the twins are class clowns but when they start their business multiple older wizards are impressed with their magical ability and hermoine comments on how clever their magical products are they are also able to use their skill to create powerful defensive magical items that the ministry uses in the war against voldermort ron is a very capable wizard and very clever although he prefers to be lazy and doesnt take things seriously but he is able to destroy two horcruxes and is on the front lines in the battle for hogwarts in deathly hallows battling very powerful dark wizards alongside his family ginny from early on is described as having a particularly powerful bat boagie hex in halfblood prince this and her ambition get her on slughorns radar as a student that he takes an interest in she also fights in the first battle of hogwarts aided by felix felices and is powerful enough to fight bellatrix alongside hermoine and luna molly and arthur are active members and have been since the original incarnation of the order of the phoenix arthur shows great skill in charming things like the ford anglier which is so magically charmed by him that it develops sentience when it begins living in the forbidden forest finally mollys abilities are greatly enhanced by love which is a type of magic that bellatrix does not respect nor know the true power of bellatrixs hubris and mollys love for her children and harry are a powerful combination that cause bellatrixs downfall molly doesnt kill bellatrix with a disarming charm the spell she casts that kills bellatrix isnt uttered but molly is channelling enough magic that the ground beneath her cracks from the intensity of it gtlooks like you know harry potter even less than you do asoiaf dont know why youre being so shitty you should work on it,0,2

AskReddit,a gutwound is typically a slow and painful way to go so usually you have time and options keep pressure on it if it makes a suction sound then unfortunately you stomach has been ruptured and the stomach acid will seep in around the rest of your organs which will be extremely painful if not suction and you havent bled to death in the last 6 minutes its good no major arteries have been hit other organs may have been ruptured but most of them are non life threatening both the appendix and the spleen will kill you quicker than the liver but your assailant would have a hell of a time getting both your kidneys in the same thrust all in all you should be good to walk to find help or phone signal however if you are looking at more than 3 to 4 hours to your nearest civilization and another few hours before you get medical assistance then i dont rate your chance of survival as very high bearing in mind that shock is setting in making it harder to make rational decisions if you miraculously managed to get to a hospital keep the battle is far from over the digestion tract is one of the bodies hotbeds for bacteria and depending on what organs have been perforated you could also have natural poisons to deal with too the other option is to lie down and start screaming,0,2

AmItheAsshole,esh  personally i think your parents werent at liberty to disclose what your girlfriend said so theyre the only ones potentially in the clear ive learnt over time that honestly when people talk about things like this with you theyre trusting you so you should respect that trust and not just openly talk about it with others no matter who they are to you its a general rule but ive gotten in trouble for thinking some things were okay to share when its just let to be people being upset if your parents were just taking out there disapproval for your actions on you and that was the only reason things got tough between you then they suck as well as for your girlfriend shes the asshole because she should have disclosed what she said to your parents you dont seem the easiest person to approach like this by your tone but youre a team you should be able to communicate with one another youre clearly compatable on some level or you wouldnt both want to still be together and obviously youre the asshole as well for the cheating but you clearly know that already and are greatful for her forgiveness your angers justified but the best approach is for you to both talk with each other and talk about transparency and honesty unfortunately because of the cheating youre on the back foot here in my opinion and it can and probably will come across hypocritical edit i suspect there might be more to this but honestly giving everyone including you the benefit of the doubt everyone has acted a little dishonestshitty here but you started it with cheating she might have taken you back but forgiveness takes time and its difficult youll both have to work through that,1,1

gaming,the other issue is that they aim to make platformers but obviously have no idea what makes platformers fun to people watching a character move fast isnt what most people want the fun of platformers is mostly derived from overcoming a challenge based around you mastering the movement in the game then having the levels challenge such mastery as well as adding new ways to move that it will also challenge but just watching a character run around then jump with timing that you basically just need to memorize isnt too engaging it becomes just a higher budget temple run which really isnt even a platformer however fans arent demanding good level design so it doesnt happen,0,2

worldnews,gtdid you seriously not read mullers letter heres a very important line that makes your entire talking point moot of course i did and no it doesnt change my talking point one bit there is no way a short statement on a 400 page report is going to fully capture the context nature or substance of the report thats not going to happen you know what would fully capture the report the report which he knew hed be releasing shortly anything else is going to take away context and substance so  now its a question of how much info to put out he knows the full report is going to be released in a short while the more info you give the more theres opportunity for misunderstanding and twisting so he went minimal and he was accurate  the tldr is on the issues of conspiracy or obstruction mueller did not determine conspiracy had taken place but could neither rule out or say for sure if obstruction happened he did provide evidence to be considered that is absolutely the truth was there additional information within that 400 page report which expanded on that yeah  of course there was but thats the point he knew the report would be out and gave an accurate and concise description of what the conclusions were of course trumps going to say exhonorated and of course the dems are going to say wait  why couldnt he rule out obstruction but  that would only be addressed by the full report like i said the guy was in a bit of a tough spot and i think hes being treated a little unfairly what he really should have done is give nothing and tell people to wait for the report but neither side was happy with that,0,1

ChapoTrapHouse,because dehumanization to the point where it has a profound effect on someones world view ie justifying violence or murder is not one specific thing there are a shit ton of ways to dehumanize someone and i guarantee you support some and not others rbehold the master race objectification of women on the right like tomi lahren eating the rich is vegan jokes invalidation is also a mechanism for dehumanization but i doubt youd complain there because you already rightfully know the ethnonationalist ideology is not valid do you want to fight the mechanisms of dehumanization in practice so that people dont get to the thinking that they are literally lesser beings part or do you want to be self righteous and defensive,0,1

marvelstudios,i keep reading this but theres really no evidence that this is the case given how the mcu and dceu played out guardians of the galaxy was a team up movie with no lead in where all of the main characters showed up for the first time and made over 700 million dollars suicide squad did the exact same thing and made the exact same amount of money two films no huge backstories they just hit the ground running threw a half dozen characters at you and you just dealt with it and both did equally well at the box officethis is evidence that a slowly building shared universe is irrelevant what matters is making a movie people want to see thats it the movie doesnt even have to be good as suicide squad showed just make a movie people want to see building a massive universe before the team up doesnt matter there is also even more evidence that building that massive universe isnt actually as costeffective as mcu fans pretend it to be the first phase of the mcu made half as much money as the first phase of the dceu despite releasing more films if the dceu would have copied the mcu they would have thrown away over a billion dollars on the hope that they would eventually convince an audience to show up as much as the dceu gets crapped on their decisions have so far been cynical but economically sound financially performatively theres no evidence that you have to build a shared universe slowly the dceu keeps making critically lukewarm movies but that has nothing to do with a massive shared universe or how many characters got individual films before the big team up it has everything to do with the quality of the actual filmmaking of the individual movies which is a completely different discussion the mcu didnt magically make a bunch of great movies it made a bunch of passable movies with a ton of easter eggs and a few actually great movies the first three four of those movies made nowhere near as much money as the worstperforming dceu movie did so why would the dceu follow in its footsteps the only real valid critique is that the dceu doesnt have as many good movies but you dont need a huge buildup to get to a good movie you just need to make a movie that people show up for  by any means necessary,0,0

freefolk,i watched the video in context and i disagree with your interpretation i think they chose their words carefully and you are reading more into the decision behind the scenes than what they actually said there is also the fact that we know grrm has discussed the arc of the story with them  i believe its more likely that what was shown is not radically different than the book resolution so how to reconcile all of this not by assuming the decision was eh fuck it lets just make it arya as you say much of the hindsight foreshadowing is taken from the early seasons which are very faithful adaptations of the book i believe that grrm did this intentionallyfor more than one character maybe youre right and its an arbitrary lastminute decision that has nothing to do with grrms plan that seems less likely to me than its basically consistent but stripped down a lot i also dont place much weight on the absence of an original ww in the books  very little has been revealed about them by book 5 i hope one day well find out but i fear we wont be seeing a book 6 let alone 7 or more,0,2

unpopularopinion,engineers do much more than create products that are built on assembly lines for example engineers design a lot of infrastructure buildings utilities etc they can also be integral to the construction and operation of power plantschemical plantsetc or they can serve as project managers in a lot of settings engineers are generally paid more i believe because when stuff goes wrong its their asses on the line usually if a building collapses it will most likely fall in the lap of the engineers who designed it unless it was obvious for some reason that good building practices were not used even then engineers would probably be required to verify the quality during and after the building process so it could still fall back on them being an engineer requires you to be the technical conscience in order to get things done in a safe and effective way and that can make you the fall guy when things go bad,0,1

unpopularopinion,except people who are serious about american politics understand that there are teams within the two parties the party makeup of congress is itself divided into coalitions not unlike a parliamentary system this was most apparent a few years ago when the tea party rose to prominence historically being a republican or a democrat did not automatically define someone ideologically there were conservative and liberal coalitions within both parties take theodore roosevelt for example he was a republican but ideologically of a centerleft wing of the party granted we dont see this happening today but that has more to do with our current political culture rather than what the rules allow for,0,0

movies,gt all but nat and thors mom you mean the only females to have actual character progression or impact on the plot of the movie gtyes this is a movie only focused on the og avengers and sadly there was only 1 woman in the six so the movie focused on only the og avengers then put a heroine shot consisting of zero avengers how do those line up exactly other than pandering gtwonder woman is part of the big three of dc captain marvel very much isnt this movies focus was on the og avengers and captain marvel isnt 1 of those 6 she got more screen time then spidey wasp strange and others im not upset that we didnt see cm fight thanos more im upset that she exists in the movie solely as a plot device shes in the movie solely to save tony and smash a ship that is what the most powerful superheroine in mcu is used for in a mission to save all life in the universe its not just screentime its relevance she was also alive for the entire 3 hours and youre comparing her screentime to people that were brought back from the dead with 30 minutes left gtfair enough but that doesnt change the fact she was a supporting character not a lead and that affects my point that femalesside characters can influence the plot and grow as characters when not being the title characters how gtno there were 5 captain marvel wasp gamora and nedulashe is one of the guardian now should be 6 scarlet witch shes an avengers obviously but also only a supporting character and yes the others valkyrie potts okoye and shuri are supporting charactersi feel like im missing someone wasp gamora and nebula are not avengers wasp is a wanted fugitive when shes snapped she was never an avenger in mcu i gave cm the benefit of the doubt for being on the conference call and being close to fury literally the only official avenger you just listed is scarlet witch who joins in aou gti dont agree panther might not have wanted to break tradition but once he know what his father had done and seen the pain it had caused and understood the good he could bring to the world he know he and wakanda must change still none of that is racist thats fine i respect your opinion believe it or not my point about bringing it up in relation to this is that any criticism of bp was deemed racist as many would feel my dislike of the heroine shot is sexist gtshe is very smart but again tony worked out time travel does that make him smarter is it a contest my point is that she is a smart and capable heroine but the movie doesnt quite care to address that does it shes just a chick with blasters gtbecause none of them are the og avengers this is focused on them no one else and yet the hero shot is of several nonavengers united only by their gender rather than their capability or contribution gti wouldnt call it throwing a bone but absolutely yes its fan service think of caps hail hydra line that is fan service to fans of the comic were cap was hydra that line and scene isnt important to the film but its 100 fan service so why cant they have fan service aimed at the ladies caps hail hydra reflects character growth hes learned since ws how to avoid fights literally the exact same fight setup and still get his way his lifetime has been nothing but war fighting hes actively avoiding fights now because he has nothing left to prove hes become a leader not a soldier referencing something from the comics doesnt make it fanservice when it reflects actual character progression its not worthless it prevents the fight and changes how the scene plays out gtand why is that so bad ive said several times now why its bad its low effort forcedout of place and highlights the failure of storytelling gtbut it isnt sexualized in any way if it was then that would be insulting so being fanservice is not always good thats my point i know its not sexualized but as you acknowledge fanservice is very often sexualized fanservice can be offensive in its blatancy or cheapness gtjust to be clear your against all fan service in this film obviously context depends if they were standing over a pile of corpses fanservice is probably not the way to go if they were battling on behalf of all life in a movie that for the last 25 hours hammered into us how dire the consequences of their previous failure was the same applies gtyou are 1 of millions your are not the only person the film makers have to please nor do i expect them to cater to just me or young girls my point is if they want to cater to young girls then do it right dont be fucking lazy about it and slap a fanservice label on it or do you think its enough for young womengirls and they should be satisfied with what they got that in the most important fight of the history of existence they are just good enough for a cameo shot gtand this statement proves you dont get what this whole movie was meant as its obviously you think this was a movie trying to tell a story the best way possible like iw did thats was not the point or goal of this movie this was a victory lapthank you to fansand a way to say good bye to the og avengers the film maker were not trying to make the best movie possible they made avengers fan service the movie i can easily name 10 scenes meant an fan service and doesnt push story at all but thats the point but you arent criticizing those other scenes why if you dont like that they made fan service the movie and wanted a more straight forward film thats legit but why arent you criticizing all the other fan service in the film so the filmmakers werent trying to make the best possible movie they could youre acknowledging that they sacrificed quality for the sake of fanservice maybe thats the problem making a movie less to pander is a disgrace both as a creator and for the audience these are passion projects for thousands of people and millions of dollars are at stake fanservice is a valid explanation it is not however a valid defense you can keep calling it fanservice and i dont disagree but fanservice is by defintion worthless is the gathering of female superheroes to save humanity worthless is this what we want young girls to cheer for and feel represented by a ten second shot in a 3 hour movie yay for inclusiveness disneymarvel gender equality achieved i also dont think you understand the meaning of fanservice by the other examples youve given john wick killing men is not fanservice it being the reason for his existence cap saying hail hydra isnt either but feel free to list these others and i bet they reflect actual character growthplot progression in some way or i dont know maybe dont happen when locked in a desperate battle with the deadliest villain in the universe whos about to get his hands again on the most powerful weapon in the universe with the spoken intention of wiping out all of existence or like you said dont make the filmmakers sacrifice the quality of the film for it,0,1

videos,if your shit is more important to you than the marvel that is human life you are pretty fucked up up there mate as far as alternatives go i dont know about the us but in my country the law constitutes that defending yourself or in this case your belongings must be appropriate to the level of the attack example someone tries to murder you legally totally safe to knock them out cold if they suffer brain damage or die from your defence tough luck but not legally devastating to you somebody steals from you incapacitating them is fine holding them til police arrives is fine but straight up killing them gets you into prison fast finding out who they are and fucking them up a week later would also be very stupid from a legal perspective and most other perspectives too   i think that is an ethically sound sensible and practical approach breakins are rarely fatal for anyone over here we have tough weapon laws so neither the burglar nor the homeowner will be equipped with dangerous weapons most of the time and people are honestly pretty well educated about this kind of stuff your house just needs to be less appealing for breakins than the other houses in the direct vicinity and you are pretty much safe from breakins anyway,1,1

AskReddit,uh what for simple math lets say tax brackets work like this from 025 you get taxed 0 from 2650 you get taxed 10 from 5175 you get taxed 20 from 76100 you get taxed 30 so lets say you make 40 for the first 25 dollars you arent taxed or taxed at 0 if you will then you are taxed 10 on the remaining 15 so you would pay 150 in taxes on your 40 now lets say you got a sweet raise and you are making 60 same as before youre taxed 0 on the first 25 youre taxed 10 on the next 25 up to the top of the 50 bracket and youre taxed 20 on the remaining 10 up to your 60 this means your total taxes would be 0250200 450 many people seem to think that once you make it into that 20 tax bracket your entire income is taxed at 20 which in this example would be 12 in total taxes vs the actual 450 so even if you were making 50 and someone offered you a 1 raise which would put you into the next tax bracket that would only be 020 more in taxes which would still be worth it for you to take the raise because at the end of the day thats still 080 more takehome pay than you had before the only time i can think of being fucked over by a raise would be if you get a raise and no longer qualify for government assistance programs which might mean you technically make more money but your expenses jump to the point where your quality of life is diminished ideally this would only be a transient phase but theres probably a dead zone there somewhere where it would be better to not take the raise unless its substantial enough to make up the difference,0,2
