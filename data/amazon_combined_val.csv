nothing bad about it but its not everything i ever wanted,1
i have these same shoes but in a different color i decided to order the black pair since they were on sale they do not fit the same as my other 34speakup34 shoes and the sole is different then my other pair as well will be returning item only thing is that the price was amazing when i purchased these and its too bad i have to return them,0
material is thin and shiny which is ok but there are lines in the material and the floral is sparse the cut and style are cute just the print and material are less than appealing,1
i liked these socks i am a diabetic and i like to have my night time socks big on me these were perfect,2
cons the innersole is improperly shaped and the foot is forced to slide to the side making it easy to turn ones anklebr br pros well made other that the poor design innersolebr br returned as defective,0
i ordered it on a thursday night and it arrived with oneday service on wednesday apparently it all sat in a service center two towns away for a couple days while the usps had to figure out how to get it to another service center 2 towns away in a different direction to deliver to mebr this is not the first time this happened it seems to be a common occurrence and i would recommend getting someone else other than usps to deliver items in order to actually have oneday service,1
runs very small,0
great dress for the price very flattering and it does not cling to your body i would purchase in other colors follow size chart,2
i was excited to find these flannels at a great price i thought i was getting a modern flannel these are not if your looking for a modern flannel cut comparative to dixon volcom or brixton these are not those these fit like ill meet you at the buffet ok in the shoulders but so silly long they have to be tucked in sizing is fine they are just cut for people who dont really care about modern fitment your dad would have liked them,1
i bought this for a gift for a teen and was pleased quality made not cheap looking or feeling she loves it,2
this band doesnt stay in place in just a little unless its cutting off my circulation by not sitting on wrist correctly its basically making the apple watch not work to its ability its not the watch its definitely band,0
i loved this band and bumper screen protector but the band broke on me within a week im still using the screen bumper but had to use a old band,0
these are nice leggings almost as soft as lularoe they are opaque enough and have a nice smooth finish i actually like the waistband better than lularoe i ordered a plus but had to return for the extra plus so they run a bit small im usually an xl or 1x and the regular plus was just a bit too tight all over to be comfortable so i ordered the larger size washed in cold and hung to dry would not chance putting them in the dryer,2
the material is an awful its thin scratchy and see through there is no way he can wear them out without his underwear showing through the material is so uncomfortable cant wear to bed save your money,0
love these they fit great feel great and arent cheap looking i ordered a size medium im 55 155lbs,2
runs extremely smallbought 2 sizes bigger than my actual size and it didnt fit,0
this sweater is super cute and fit as expected its definitely oversized but not in an awkward sort of way it fit me similar to the model and is flattering i am 5234 weigh 115 lbs and wear a bra size of 34 b i typically wear a xs or s in tops so i ordered a size s in the white color i am super happy with the fit and color although the white is more of an off white than the bright white shown in the photo the sweater also has a strange odor but im sure that will go away after a washingbr br i took off 1 star cuz it took several weeks to arrive i want to order more colors but am uncertain if i will since the shipping is so slowbr br overall i am happy with my purchase,2
when i washed it it shrank,1
this was a gift for a family member they loved it,2
really nice dress and accessories,2
soso,1
it feels disproportionate in the cups it seems like they are too far apart and the material looks a bit thin so you can see the cup inserts if you tried this i would size down one size i dont really like the thin material,1
the pajamas are very soft but a bit thin good for lounging in but not made for cooler weather the pants are longer than expected and the shirt is shorter on torso not quite cropped though there was some extra thread exposed on some of seams all in all a comfy pair of lounge wear but not suited for all body types,1
so much cuter irl buy it,2
good sun glasses,2
they are soft and very comfortable chinese sizing is a lot smaller so be sure to get larger than what you normally wear i will buy more at this price,2
my son loves it got it for a decent price boys are rough so im expecting to have to replace it by next christmas tho im hoping notbr br update the watch came with instructions to set the alarm and the time ect however they were ripped so i only had the middle of the paper the sides were gone so we had to just wing it but my son loves it,0
great earrings wore them on the fourth of july and got lots of compliments very light weight they do not pull on your ears,2
to small did not look sterling im returning for refund,0
it looks like a half shirt its half the height it should be but its 3 times as wide as it should be its unwearable,0
color is not correct with what is shown on web site,1
cheaply made,0
it was cute but the top didnt fit,1
56 137 lbs 36d usually a size 6 or a mediumbr br this jacket is so pretty its stretchy and cute but sadly it fits everywhere but across the boobs i can just get it zipped because the fabric stretches but its not a good look i could wear it open like in the summer but im not sure how useful that is if i sized up it wouldnt look quite right because the slim look would be lost and the rest of the jacket would be too large for mebr br if your chest is on the smaller side you will love this jacket if your chest is fuller this probably is not the jacket for you even if you size up,2
i was disappointed in how these fit very tight in the thigh area,0
this is not a good product it leaves fuzz on my carpet the fuzz at the toe is worn off already first couple of days it was worn off i only wore them a couple of hours a day very disappointing,0
the gray leg warmers are good quality but very small im 57 117lbs and they fit almost like a sock over my leggings if you dont care if they slouch or gather these will work for you length is good thick knit design well made,0
nice basic watch for the price,2
absolutely love this bag and will buy another when this ones about done,2
well my top got lost in the mail i requested a refund they refunded 2 change the top cost 2083 not sure what the 2 refund was but it wasnt the scrub top my son is a front line worker he loves star wars and mandelorian this was supposed to be a birthday gift no exactly pleasedbr after contacting the company again they did reimburse more than was stated br after this i might at some point check them out again,1
the new balance is a comfortable shoe it walks well on the tredmill havent been on the street yet the toe cap is smaller than i expected i purchased a new balance 680 v2 for around the same price that was sold as a size 14 4e us and it was much larger glad the walking shoe has a mess toe area for the expantion of my feet,1
my wifes comment niiice she had fun watching me put it on and her taking it off but it is not something to wear for an extended time as the mesh kind of bites in is a turn on for the ladies though cheap enough for a nights thrill,1
smaller than i expected,1
horrible for and cheaply made so it was returned promptly,0
it makes me feel like a low rider in la adjustable straps are good must be handwashed and arrives with a bit of a production smell,2
is not shiny color is red black mixed returned,1
perfect for kid,2
used for pictures they fit very small,1
wouldnt waste my money charm fell off bracelet didnt hold up bad investment,0
very cheap looking i returned,0
this is pretty short so dont bend over ever also the under dress is very thin,1
these gloves are fine down to about 30 degrees above zero at 20 degrees and colder i start feeling the cold in my hands several minutes after going outsidebr br the gloves do provide good protection against the wind but dont expect them to perform well in extreme cold,1
my five year old granddaughter loves unicorns every size shape and color she is also very fond of her american girl dolls she was in need of a new robe and i found the perfect one for her and her doll matching outfits for american girl dolls and their moms are expensive when purchased from the ag company although the quality of these robes is not as good as that of ag they are good value and good quality i am happy i made the purchase,2
my girl loved these belly rings they have been a great present for her birth day and one she is proud to show off daily,2
i ordered the black and gold glasses the picture of the product looked like the sides were yellow but in fact were a more metallic gold not good or bad to me just different than i expected i still love them and happy to have another pair of goodr sunglassess i run with one pair this pair will be for golf great value for the money you wont be disappointed,2
i really like these but they get loose after screwing them together like youve worn the thread even after the first use also theyre really hard to thread together and it takes some practice theyre sort of cheap but they look decent in your heirs,1
cheap material no real pockets buttons cheap,0
im 51034 med build with 33 waist and 30 inseam i have a couple of the smalls and they fit lengthwise just right but the waist can be a little snug thought id try the medium so i ordered one and although the waist was a good fit the length was a couple inches too long,1
does not fit as advertised everything there was a lot of pulls in the hat not sure if it was used or not it took a month to receive it buyer beware,0
my son must have a wide toe box he always complains about his socks we bought these because they are supposed to be seamless they do have seams the seams are smaller than normal but they are still present at the corners exactly where my son is sensitive they are better than normal socks but they dont totally solve our problems either still looking for a better option,1
started to get pulls in it after about 4 hours of use,2
my coin seems to be close to falling out and it doesnt hold or display well once seated inside,0
very disappointed in this item the chain was so cheap and in knots unable to get the knots out the birthstone was ok,0
very cool robe made of soft plushy material it was described as a mens robe but after trying it on i could see it was clearly tailored for a woman lgxl size was way to small for my husband who normally wears a large size,0
im a 34dd and a lot of the reviews in my size said the bra fit like a demicup it does not if you have a boob shape or orientation on your chest that requires you to wear a demicup or balconette or plunge style bra or even a pushup shape with no extra padding even this bra will likely not work for youbr br it fit perfectly and felt fantastic on though i am not sure how i felt about having the shoulder adjusters toward the front and after adjustments they ended up directly on top of my shoulders which looked like i had weird bony growths or something going on under a tank top the main problem though was the full cup i have asymmetrical breasts and what i call droopy a company like thirdlove has deemed relaxed and they are sideset i fill out the bottom 75 of the cups perfectly making as many adjustments as possible though i could not lift them any higher nor would i ever be able to fill out the top inch or so of the cupsbr br going down a cup size in my experience with all sorts of full coverage bras does not help because of the location and shape of my breasts on my chest had this bra been a demicup i might have been able to not adjust the shoulder straps as much trying to fill that gap either which sort of just flattened against my chest all weird compared to the rest of the bra below which was full of breast tissue if warners decides to come out with a version of this bra in a demicup i will definitely try again,0
maybe i bought this from the wrong seller i dont knowbr br i took all my measurements twice and followed the sellers size chart and ordered accordingly where they fail is that more important than your waist measurement is your underbustbr br dress fit fine at my waist and at the bust zipper wouldnt close the last 15 br br second problem is the top is completely transparent there are two little pink pads to cover your nipples but the pads are completely visible through the gauzy material of the dress so it looks really cheap and cheesybr br like i said maybe i got the short stick and bought it from a knock off seller but theres no way of knowingbr br sent it back,1
i loved the message on bracelet my daughter has been through so much i hope this gift to her is inspirational,2
i was so excited to get these but then i opened the package and one is really bent at the top and the other is fine and slightly rounded these are extremely fragile i was hoping they wouldnt be so soft i cant wear earrings that dont match im so sad,0
absoluteyl love this shirt and it fits great on my husband who is a big guy,2
good protection for the value,1
i cannot use the man because i have no means to connect it to the watch it did not come with spring pins in the pins i have will not fit i could not return the item because the seller reminded me that the description stated that the spring pins were not included,0
it was too snug and the sleeves were alittle short,1
too big,0
looks great i bought this for my husbands blaze fit bit it fell out someplace while we were shopping apparently it didnt fit in the space provided well enough now he just has an empty bracelet,0
it is loose so i would go a size down i am 170 lbs about a size 10 and it was big on me when i ordered a large its okay nothing too fabulous about it,1
good everyday cap for a good price did not fade in the wash,1
i liked one side of the flag looked very nice flip it over and the othrr side of the flag is upside down why i cannot use this will be returning,0
i purchased these boots for my 7 year old grand daughter she wore them 2 times and one of the eyelets fell off reordered a replacement pair she wore them less than 4 times and guess what fell off if you guessed the eyelets you would be correct the material where they attach the eyelets is so this it is ridiculous these boots will not hold up she only wore these to our christmas parties and to the store that is it and broke dont buy these unless you know a way to repair these boots 2 pairs same problem what wrong with this picture,0
really wanted these shoes to work but they were too uncomfortable the left shoe hurt at the bottom front of my foot the right shoe hurt in the ankle area they seemed to fit but maybe a larger size would have helped i gave 3 stars since its possible someone with less sensitive feet might be able to wear them they look really nice and stylish even in my size 105 i love the saucony brand for the wider toe box and will look for another version,1
works great but i had to make sure i can put things in the slots through the side the front is too small i still really like it for organizing my workout area it fit nicely behind the door too,2
i like the deer and flag design but i was really hoping for a better quality robe for the price this was 50 and feels like it should have been around 2030 very thin not plush but it does fit ok,1
didnt match the adimage very blurry will not buy again,0
very nice and thick,2
cups a bit wide under arms,1
videoid5823a0d5d9d01c5bff9236e70468c419 every woman needs to buy this skirt i was so hesitant on what to purchase when it comes to the faux leather skirts and knew i always wanted one i love the rouched look as it is more flattering to the body this is also high waisted and is super comfortable,2
love this dress have gotten so many compliments on it,2
great but but its small pendant but a great accessory,1
love it,2
very cute but threw them away they broke when putting them on,1
i really liked this in the picture i liked it on too but when i started washing it it got disgusting its got lots of pills on it i put it in the washing bag for delicates and wash it in delicate cycle but the more i wash it the worse it gets would never buy another one,0
i would recommend getting a size larger very pretty looks great for work,1
i absolutely love these glasses they look great and i get a ton of compliments on them,2
the fit is a little frumpy and i dont love the materialbr but its good quality,1
this was a very cute outfit the onesie fit perfectly the pants were huge on my daughter i had to roll them up on the waist also the bow broke not worth spending the money on,0
too big fabric was very cheap and the fabric was full of holes it was damaged and i have to pay to return it,0
my only problem is i havent had them that long less than half a year and they are turning color sort of a rose gold color not staining my fingers though good for price and cute takes awhile to get them but i would buy again,2
too smallbr hard to return,0
realmente decepcionada para mujeres que tienen senos grandes no hay nada de soporte ni confort el material cambio totalmente en su primera lavada no vale la pena gastar en este producto,0
goggles fog,1
nice coat the sizes are totally off big disappointment,1
comfortable fit,2
im giving this a 3 because it comes with the link removal tool but overall look feel and quality is a bit lacking if u look closely the metals dont match up infact it looks as if the rose gold is just painted on and will chip off over time,1
a perfect example of purchasing a clothing item that does not meet the standards of description total waste of money,0
i love the sparkle and threw away the boxafter wearing two times one of the stones fell outwish i had the box to send these back,0
the middle of the bottom goes up too high for my comfort level and the sleeves are a little more baggy and so that designer feel was lost but the size was fine it just wasnt my style,1
fit small for a xl,0
this is a very cool looking belt thats about the extent of its usefullness it runs small and is way too flimsy to use for a concealed or open carry sending mine back,0
3xl is not even close so if you are a true 3xl dont bother im an xl and it barely fit its a shame becauseb its not a bad outfit came with song cute items,1
the backpack needs improvement 3 months hiking and the product is done i really appreciated the sidebags which made it easy to acess daytoday items but the cushins used for this product meltau down to nothing after a month i carried the backpack yosemite at the metal frame kind of inner sceleton but only a poor alupipe bowed made its way out at the bottom and hurt my butt lucky me the pipe was covered,1
i absolutely love this diaper bag it looks great has so many compartments and wipes clean so easily a diaper bag backpack is way better than a tote as it gives you more range of motion when chasing after other kids worth every penny and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase a diaper bag,2
i paid attention to what other reviews were saying and ordered one size up for my husband the reason i said fit as expected was for that reason sorry if this is confusing but i think the reason for the one size up is because of the little lip on the back of the slipper if i had gone with the smaller size he probably would be walking on the back of the slipper instead of his foot fitting within the slipper he really likes them,2
plating faded within a week rope is also falling apart,0
cute comfy breathable but get worn out quickly from washing and drying,1
fits great however i received one that had obviously been worn it reeked of cheap cologne and body odor,0
amazing leggings super buttery soft i will definitely be buying more,2
the sizing is small i would size up twice the fabric isnt the best either not very comfortable but good for a quick cosplay costume,0
fit great and was warm and soft id give it five stars but after the second wash i noticed spotting on the front like the dye was more concentrated in spots i thought it was a spill at first but id only worn it once really disappointed bc it was otherwise perfect,1
it looked like a printer was running out of ink or something the whole thing was much more blue than it was supposed to be,1
cute but buy a size smaller runs big to me which will give u no shape in this dress,2
these pants are light and the waist fits nicely however the crotch is just comical looks like im about to shoot a porno or dance in the latest chippendales show i have no idea how anyone could wear these maybe it was a bad pair either way if you have anything between your legs id recommend passing on these,0
cute everyday look,2
its just ok,1
love this outfit,2
loved it good quality shirt and the letters have held up in the laundry,2
my husband likes the texture and design but it starts wearing really fast,0
not what i was expecting its not an actual ear cuff its an eating because it is so heavy it does not stay up on your ear the way it is supposed to and when it arrived my package was damaged and the stud for the earring was missing dont recommend to anybody you could buy the same thing in a better quality for the same price at places like claires and hot topic,0
this watch looks amazing for the price i got a lot of compliments on it and everyone thought it was so expensive the only bad thing is that the gold color on the band has faded the gold color has now turned into a silver color but the head of the watch has stayed gold no one has really noticed the band color change so its not anything completely horrible overall a good buy in my eyes,1
really thin chains that tangle easily,1
the sizing was way off the fit was too small its being returned,0
this jewelry organizer is too large and bulky for the amount of jewelry that it stores,0
nice band bad allergic reactions,0
these came in very handed when we had a freak snow storm they are easy to get on and very comfortable this is important for me as i have foot issues,2
i wear a 10 and couldnt get the dress over my head,0
if all you plan to do is loaf these shoes are fine lightweight with memory foam they are soft and cushiony however they offer virtually no support i was supposed to receive a 105 but instead got a 95 so had to have someone with that size try them on while the initial response was positive it is not a shoe that wold withstand heavy use it would be fine for hanging around the house or possibly a casual friday at the office the synthetic sole is rigid and despite the word 34flex34 in the name this shoe has no bend whatsoever it slips on and has a tab on the heel for easy removal the knit mesh upper is extremely light it is quite breathable but affords no protection frankly for the money you could buy either a couple of pairs of really nice slippers or a good pair of shoes instead,1
very lightweight breathable shoes they do not last very long but for the price i dont mind,2
love the robe good quality very silky i ordered a size larger than i typically wear i like the extra room i am only 52 and the robe comes to the knee only negative shipping from china took 5 weeks,2
quality wasnt what i expected gave it to my granddaughter for her 16th birthday she was pleased,1
leaves a weird dark stain on skin after wearing even after washing,1
the box was torn on one sidebut they were delivered right on time as expected the shoes are cute and my granddaughter loves them,2
really cute but will stretch your ears a little,1
got here faster then expected only thing it huge way bug for my wrists and i have bigger then normal wrists im tall so on a normal person it would slip right off,1
this is not anything but a slip to wear under a see through dress there is no polyester in this material its a same the amount of money spent and the poor quality of this product pockets are very low its is see through dont buy i would put no stars,0
cute shoe and appeared well made but not for any little girl who has a wide foot had to send them back,1
this is really bad sorry small is listed as having a 275 waist it actually measures 24 inches burgundy is gathered at waist and not flat shown in photo buttons do not align correctly and it is a tulip cut at bottom very misrepresented,0
well this is a very stretchy topbr i like the bright pink color and the necklinebr br what i dont like is the fabric it feels like a nightgown in fact i plan to use this to sleep in because it will ne nice and slick on my microfiber coverbr i would never wear this out of the house the material is just too thin and instead of hanging nicely it pulls over and shows every lump bump and spare tire pass,1
bro i could barely breath with this on needs some air holes or something other then that its ok but wouldnt wanna wear for more then 510 minutes,1
the owl is gorgeous which is why i bought this the chain looks pretty but the gold color started fading to black within one week i understand that it is not intended to be real gold but the chains quality is poor,1
i bought a xxl still to small when i wear a l to xl think i have to be a medium so runs very small like the cut but material very thin and see through,1
daughter loves it and wears it every day sturdy material doesnt easily break,2
great,2
its really cute but the ball spins off very easy i recommend glueing the ball onto the chain,1
very colorful i got this fanny pack to hold treats for training my dog it worked perfectly until he chewed it up,2
i was able to wear these for about four times then a screw holding the lens in place fell out never to be seen again unbearable at this point i set them aside only to see both lens screws had fallen out rending them unusable you get what you payfor,0
le faltar compresión,1
exactly as picturedreally didnt expect them to look and be this good,2
feels tight in the goods department and am i am not that large maybe in time pouch will streatch out there is no fly so peeing is a bit more cumbersome especially the way it is designed to keep ones goods perched out if i were to try again would get extra large i am 34 waist,1
i bought this robe to have a nice light robe after a bath i really like this robe but beware it shrinks i washed and dried it and its barely fitting me now i am currently pregnant but its barely closing when tied sleeves come mid forearm to me i still think worth purchasing but just something to consider,1
extremely thin item stretches out throughout the day and you have to dry it to shrink it back into shape not the best quality but for the price its a ok deal,1
love it i was planning on a run of the mill thin cinch bag this is heavy duty has great straps and clasp in front to hold straps together across chest zippered pouch grandson loves it and its perfect size for his gi belt nunchucks and water bottle,2
i wouldnt say i was impressed with this jacket it is light weight and has lots of pockets it seems well made and all but is not worth the money,1
optics are great frames feel exceedingly cheap for 10 about what i expected,1
i adore this swimsuit after having 3 kids i havent loved being in a swimsuit until now this one is a bit cheeky but i like it and it looks great on the girls as most tops wont fit my bust this one it excellent all over highly recommend,2
fast shipping great quality,2
it looks cute in the picture and with a scarf when i received it i thought maybe i could use it for halloween nope it is not something i can wear out of the house the neckline is high in the front and low in the back thin material the little pompoms are put in the front of the neckline and around the wrists only and the pattern reminds me of the 60s i dont want to pay for shipping to return it because its not worth it,0
a few were duds but most of them worked the rubber bands are pretty tight on my fingertips so not very comfortable my finger are not large but they were still fun to play with oddly enough i found myself loving them as mini flashlights especially while camping with all the other junk i carry around in my pockets its nice to have something so useful be so tiny and in pretty colors my nieces and nephews thought they were really cool,1
its useful to open doors andor pushing buttons but sometimes it takes strength of your fingershands for heavy doors,1
i was very hopeful for this bottom i ordered a 22 in the black the sizing is perfect and is true to actual size comes up nice and high but it is see thru in the back the front is double lined but the back isnt and you can get a full moon if you have a top thats long enough it wouldnt matter i guess tho,0
this is a nice looking belt but be careful with storage you might want to hang this one up i roll my belts and keep them in a drawer and this one is already starting to crack and stretch a bit im going to try treating it with leather oil to get some more life out of it but if that doesnt workim going to be really disappointed with jm leather,1
silky satiny sexy slipgown feels good on the skin,2
im on the fence about the rating im the biggest costume jewelry fan ever the positives are you get alot of pieces and variety but overall some of the pieces look cheap to remedy that i wear just 1 necklace looks better than wearing 3u get what u pay for,1
i did order it one size smaller and the fit was ok but if you are a curvy woman this may not be for you the fabric is very crisp the legs were very wide at the bottom you get get what you pay for,1
son buenos el diseño es muy bonito son los 2 que compro los primeros fueron de piel estos parecen de plástico pero me quedaron perfecto y están muy bonitos,2
returned because the fit was not good,0
my husband chose these he likes them but thought they would be bigger the blue stripes are very pretty,2
nice fit but itchy like most 100 marino wool returned,1
although the shirt is nicely designed it is paper thin material i will keep it for the hot summer but i will not buy from this company again sorry but for 2200 this should have better quality material,1
beautiful piece catches light and shimmers,2
i must of got a dud because the stem of watch wont stay in and the time keeps stopping it hard being a medical assistant and not being able to take pulses,0
this was a gift and she loved it i wish there had been a larger size available but she will be watching from home in this shirt so it will have to do,2
zipper broke going back,0
the frames are too small for a man you should let them know before they buy them is there a no star rating because what good are glasses that dont fit,0
broke after a year,1
it kept the sun off my face and was very comfortable easy to pack in suitcase too,2
this shirt was soft and high quality the shirt has stretch to it but is clingy and runs small,1
this was much cuter than i anticipated i have a hard time finding cute dresses this one did not disappoint i usually wear a medium but i have a larger chest sometimes run into problems with it being tight in the chest this one was not i may even get another color,2
i love the material which is a thick cotton its a little short waisted and right on size not overly roomy it looks great with high waist jeans i might order a large if i buy another one,1
did not like the fit or quality,0
the backing keeps falling off,0
disliked it wasnt compatible with my michael kors,0
excellent product cheap durable and keeps timedate better than all of my quartz watches i only wish the strap is made easier to be switched out with a nato,2
really cute but the bottoms were thin no big girl needs that crisscrossed back it was like a busted can of biscuits back there it didnt come up high enough with the bottoms it was right at my natural and it was snugso more biscuits,1
it looks nice but the fitting is very loose size is perfect but the style is loose,2
worked easily were durable and choice of colors made it easy for me to pick one that was easily identified in airport,2
the print is pretty but i was expecting cotton not polyester satin its ok but im disappointed,1
was not comfortable for me,1
really high but it looks so cute the soles are more plastic than rubber because this is a cheap quality shoe probably made in china and nothing like the actual ones that are rubber soled and 90 but it really does the trick i dont recommend wearing them for super long they do hurt because the sole is thick and hard but it really is cute and good for the price for an imitation shoe its also quite sturdy,2
love the ease of putting on and taking off warm but not water resistant,0
i thought this was 14 k gold all the way through the wording is very misleading i also found a bangle same material on macys online site for 99 on sale and it looks better i can say i should have looked at the detail of the bracelet before i purchased three and are returning all three however they are beautiful but not wat i expected an found same item for cheaper price,1
im a us size 9 so i ordered the 9 hugebr br ordered the 8s almost exactly the same size as the 9sbr br not sure im going to try a third time,0
the strap broke after only a few uses,0
love this product,2
it did not quite reach my expectations perhaps because i own so many cardigans sweaters wraps jackets etc i have a higher standard for such items those the price is right for this type of item the overall look left something to be desired i plan on using it as a house robe something along those lines,1
very simple watch two settings time and date the led lights are super bright and it seems like it is sensitive to the touch but not so sensitive that a shirt grazing it will turn it on no sounds so no worry about annoying alarms i am a 26 year old man and it fits me fine my only critique is certain numbers are very hard to read with the lights and the band can make your wrist sweaty but for a 7 watch this is pretty great,2
perfect fit most comfortable hat ive worn great quality,2
34pearls34 are peeling and 34silver34 is tarnishing flaking off,0
these are fleamarket quality socks at a flea market price so i guess i cant complain these are made from very thin material you can see through it on your foot also they arent what i would consider 34no show34 as soon as i pulled them out of the box i could see the ankle area extends farther up that it appears in the picture i tried them on and confirmed this theres a good 15 inches of material showing above my sneakers and thats after i tried adjusting the socks lower on my foot without cramming extra fabric into my toe area so on the plus side no worrying about quitter socks slipping down in your shoe but if like me you really prefer a no show sock these are not what you want ill probably just wear them around the house or give them to one of my sons who arent as picky,1
love the socks just as pictured happy with purchase,2
doesnt fit well if your child is tall for their age,1
the material was thin almost lycra style,0
purchased two,2
ok not awesome,1
if i could give it a 5 i would product and package came broken missing the backs of the earring and the biggest insult to all this is that the earrings pictured are most definitely not even close to what you get what you get is not worth a penny and definitely not worth the wait extremely disappointed and would recommend you run the other way if you are even remotely thinking of getting these i wish someone would have left a true honest feedback before i would not have wasted my money or efforts,0
nice warm sock that is not too bulky to wear with boots,2
this is cute but reminds me of a wrestling singlet also difficult to change my daughter once shes in it since it doesnt have snaps at the bottom,1
very cheap little plastic necklace,2
wish id returned it i bought it because i favor shoulder bags i did not like the short carrying straps as they got in the way when i tried to get the handcarrying straps out of sight the bag just gaped wide and looked ridiculous poor engineering of an otherwise attractive purse,0
this is a very cute soft jacket but the proportions were pretty far off the arms are long enough but the coat is much shorter than expected and way too big around it seems to be proportioned for a toddler even in the bigger sizes,1
gag gift,2
excellent quality,2
bought this about 2 months ago the main zippers are already starting to catch routinely the bag is much more flexible than it looks in the pictures unless you are carrying a bunch of notebooksfilesfoldersetc the bag just sags and looks rather unattractive the velcro for the front flap isnt strong enough to keep the bag closed and things can slip outbr br spend a little more for a better quality bag this isnt worth it,1
very cute hat but just a little big yet for my grand daughter real happy with the quality,2
firstit is not as pictured i assumed i was getting fourmy fault for not read description i looked and looked online for instructions since they were not clear and couldnt figure out even what to do,1
bought this for a 90s party it fit perfectly for as an open shirt,2
shipping issue box was crushed so was hat it worked for the photoop black didnt show the creases once we reshaped it but it was disappointing to see it inadequately packagedshipped,1
satisfied,2
i like this pair of glasses for blocking the blue light the frames were a little larger than i thought i dont consider my face too petite but these look big on me they feel chinsy and flimsy and smudge easily,0
i was very pleased with this purchase 180s offer a great quality product thats comfortable to wear a good brand to purchase,2
the strap that should have covered the little toe was placed in the wrong location little toe hangs out and causes pain sent back they fit and looked good but the wrongly placed strap was too painful too keep,0
make a size 12,0
these absolutely do not aid in diminishing glare or help wnight vision they do is turn everything yellow they do help brighten everything up on a cloudy day,0
horrible sewing and terrible fabric stay clear away,0
this would have made a great decorative door matt for my home but it is only a table mat not even possible to use for any floor area sent me a different address to return never will buy from this seller again i didnt need placemats for my dinning area,0
pretty fabric with nice soft interior but the zipper broke on first wear,0
the idea you can touch the screen with the glove was good but the the patched parts of thumb and index were annoying they prevent me from wearing,0
i always have to break in new shoes these were the first pair that didnt make my feet ache after the first few uses i also didnt experience my pinky toes feeling smashed i have tried wide width and they end up being too loose after a few uses and that could affect my feet over time,2
the filter insert is very difficult to install,1
waaaayyyy too large for 8,1
used for spray painting liked very much,2
just didnt fit me right,1
comfortable but very thin also the waistband in one of them came apart,1
these shoes are a piece of crap i wore them twice and they are treating apart in the front,0
the students received compliments from start to finish as home coming queen,2
the colors are not as dark as the picture shows they are light and the part that looks black is actually blue not like the picture at all very unhappy,0
size l fit girlfriend 5 1 36d she ties around waist notes very comfy,2
nothing extraordinary about this item cheaply made and it shows as such when worn,1
so disappointed this is a cool costume and my son loves it however after only wearing if half a dozen times a hole was developed in the back and of course we are just outside the return window the quality of the fabric is very poor,0
the double clasps are a good feature helping to make the fit secure the latches for adjusting the over the shoulder length are problematic the latch tends to catch on the fabric of the suspender and the spring is quite strong making it difficult to adjust i also found that the metal is a bit sharp making me wonder if my shirts fronts will survive the suspenders,2
great value but the wire wants to spin in the hole where it connects to the acrylic,1
not a bad hat but definitely not best quality the us price should be 24 think i would like it better if i didnt realize amazon marked it up 10lol,1
the product is too big and it goes below the knee,1
great shirt,2
ordered 38x30 pants label says 38x30 but they measure 38x32 so had to get them altered which is a pain,1
not well finished lots of rough spots to cause that chafing youve been missing,0
the dress is beautiful the size was right the only problem i have is the elastic is too high it is too low to wear it under your breast and too high to wear around waist looks good in the closet but i would think twice before i ordered this one,1
absolutely no one wants to see a 60something woman in a two piece suit ive always had trouble buying onepiece suits that fit im so longwaisted that when i was covered at the top then the suit rode up at the bottom to find this suit that is 2piece but has a tank top to go on over is fantasticbr br it has moderate elastic that is comfortable the top has light cups for good shaping and the multiple straps are very interesting my only complaint is that the navy tank top has stitching down the back intentionally creating puckers to the bottom edge this causes the tank top to hike up a little in the middle of the back i think the tank top would have looked better if this stitching wasnt there and the hem was straight acrossbr br heres my disclaimer im 67 57 and 160 pounds i ordered an xl based on the size chart and it fits as expectedbr br overall im very happy with this suit,2
i bought these shoes so i could have something warm and comfortable to wear around the house and thats all theyre good for ive had these for a little a month and exclusively wear them at home but theyre already tearing apart the fabric is separating from the sole which is disappointing but expected from a product in this price range when they wear out completely ill splurge and get some real uggs that i can wear when out in the cold desert nights too,1
well i cant wrote about the wear of the product as i am returning them i purchased a half size bigger than my size and the boots fit my foot but not my calf and there is no give and i dont have particularly large calfs or anything i was saddened bc i was looking for a casual waterproof boot that was warm enough for winter found these and was excited but again im returning them,1
too expense for its size and fit,1
i bought these with the intention of being able to ground all day every day the adhesive on these is strong but not strong enough the wear and tear tore one off in 2 weeks if it was a subscription it would be better because the straps do not last long with moisture outside of that the benefits were proper and to my expectations i was much less stressed and i will eventually buy another pair,1
love it great for maternity ware that i can still use after baby just pull up the top of skirt above bump instead of folding the waist band love colors and material great price too worth buying several,2
the package says new and improved theyre new they suck they feel like the crappy mass produced socks i no longer want to buy and now ive paid a premium price for that experience it sucks,1
it is very tight on your head it is a great value for the money screen scratches very easily but it is inexpensive,1
the mask was stitched such that the stripe was no longer a stripe so it did not look like the picture in the listing which clearly shows a helmet stripe i returned the item i reached out before doing that and the message was basically we have no control over that inventory return and see if the next one is better,0
these are the best socks i have ever purchased by far they hold up to some serious wear and tear as well as keep your feet warm when you are working outdoors for hours at a time in upstate ny winters no less great value they may seem expensive for socks but worth every penny,2
cheaper than i expected no shape,0
4pcs what are you considering 4pcs 2 nose rings a clear bag and a red drawstring bag when you say 4pcs it means 4pcs i love the nose rings its just youre misleading i want another 2 nose rings sent yes different colors but same size for your misleading information,0
i have worn merrells for years and have 5 pairs of various styles these ran very narrow in the toes even after i went a size up i was massively disappointed because i walked the soles smooth on my old ones and needed a replacement at the moment i will have to hike barefoot i am at a loss,0
returned,1
very cheaply made,0
i have enormous faith in the carharrt brand if they sold tuna fish salad sandwiches via the internet i would buy them with calm assurance year around and especially during the hot summer monthsbr i now own two of their rain defender paxton jackets and several of their terrific coats none of the items has failed to meet and exceed my expectations,2
great quality but too small my son wears a 34 jean i bought a 38 carhartt and it was too tight,1
fit as expected,1
as is often the case i bought these clod hoppers without thoroughly checking all reviews they looked very appealing but structurally stiff uncomfortable and easily lost when walking at more than a snails pace im keeping them as a reminder dont buy cheap,1
im not satisfied with the fit i got a medium and its huge i ended up never wearing it,0
got this as a gift my niece and she loved itshes fifteen and loves cats so it was a great gift for herits not plastic so thats goodjust an awesome gift to buy a young girl who like cats or cute jewelry great deal as well,1
this was soft and nice feeling flattering i dont think so it ran small and stretched tightly across my wifes belly we just returned it because they didnt have the next size upbr br so if youre ordering size up,1
this works as a cover up over your bathing suit for the beach or pool etcbr its roomy and fits my daughter she is 56 and bustybr this is light weight and is a see threw but not as much as other beach cover ups she hasbr the color looks like coral with colorful embroidery on the front that is done wellbr br i washed this on a delicate in zipper laundry bag and hung on a hanger to dry,1
i will be returning it because it has too many pocketszippers which is the problem i have with my current crossbody bag its too difficult to find anything,0
the fabric is a wonderful cotton amazing pattern with complimentary colors i wear size 18 or 20 i ordered 26 i like room i think a size 24 would work i work i elementary school and color works the school colors are tie dye this is perfect dress in so many ways one of the teachers is a seamstress and she was mesmerized by the fabric i am thinking about ordering another dress and asking for pockets i am 5434 and the dress comes to my angles again perfect thank you lakkar haveli,2
mask that arrived was not as pictured the grin and print are very small in relation to the mask the print is almost illegible from a distance the material isnt breathable either glasses beware,0
i wish i had something positive to say please spend the extra 10 and look for deals via french connection or the like this fabric is worth about 3 max unbelievably thin cheap and i feel many are being taken advantage of with regard to the price point,0
i love all my cheap amazon clothes from china typically but this one isnt great it is made out of swimsuit material so it is shiny which is odd the seams look cheap and just overall it looks really cheap on the sleeves i think they literally just added a few extra inches of the stripe pattern so they are super long also the top color isnt really mustard it is more yellow i wanted to like it but it isnt for me,0
love it,2
i am a plus size person and these socks fit feel great and look awesome what more can you ask for,2
perfect costume had all the neighbors scared best costume in town,2
nice length and quality of fabric the waist band on grey and pink are not tight at all the navy and orangeish pair both have nicely sewn waist elastic thank you,1
i ordered for my husband for fathers day and planned to decorate it i like that it has 3 large pockets on the bottom but the apron itself is a little bit short its a perfect fit for me im 5ft 4in so it will be too short for my husband,0
my doctor says the ball of my foot is in pain because of flat arches sigh so i researched and found these under shoes for medical professionals theyre the prettiest embroidered leaf pattern n taupe suede and go with everything except maybe black slacksjeans i bought another pair of klogs for thosebr br i couldnt believe the instant relief i was going to save these to wear out and i do wear them nearly everywhere because i cant stand regular shoes until i get some very good inserts my podiatrist said never go barefoot and with these i dont have to i just keep them by the bed slide them on first thing and they pretty much dont leave my feet all day bought toe socks because i cant stand to wear shoes without socks eventually the odor retires them before they wear outbr br ive tried one other brand of supportish shoes orthaheel and they feel great too but these are just so cute and convenient ive been told that they look very good with capris this summer and jeans are a nobrainer,2
this actually a prereview ive been awaiting the product and reading the reviews just want to let readers know im in very sunny jamaica and if these glasses work here then ill certainly let you know cant wait to get them,0
sizing was ok fabric seemed decent but spandex so will cling but cant wear as these are too long and end mid thigh for me would come down below my hips even if 56 inches shorter,1
i purchased this wig for a cosplay i am doing in april the color of the wig is beautiful and the amount of hair that is actually apart of the wig is astounding for the price it is gorgeous however the cosplay i am doing requires lose long waves and a long side bang just like the picture what i received was a beautiful wig however the curls are tighter and two put together and there is no long side bang the wig is beautiful and i am wondering if it is just what happens when so many are being made i think i can brush them out and potentially get some of the bang to the side for the price you can not beat it it is a beautiful wig either way however be warned if what you want is exactly like what is shown in the picture you maybe a but disappointed,1
poorly made shoe which was so disappointing the shoe has a high instep hard to keep on there is dried glue on the inside of the shoe quality is poor and really wanted to loved these,1
cheap,0
beautiful but really short,1
great product i would purchase again,2
good quality bra but it is somewhat small in the cup i can work with it but i couldve gone up one size ill know better next time i like the back and side support,1
the seams came unglued 2 weeks after wearing them i guess that is why they were priced low im giving them 2 stars because the insides were fuzzy,0
i love them they dont cut off circulation at knee and they dont fall down,2
light weight but the material is too hard,0
pretty good quality not to thin they are not wrinkle free but the good cotton ones are supposed to wrinkle learn to love the wrinkle,2
nice quality material bigger than expected,2
no rash no metal on your skin like apple band i love these bands they are more flexible than the name brand they fit perfect and are very comfortable,2
i bought two of these watches they look beautiful but one of them wouldnt work at all the other worked for 3 days and the hour and minute hands became stuck in place but the second hand kept going so it was a total waste of money,0
very heavy material not as flattering as i thought it would be,1
i decided to do a procon review of this watch because that seems the easiest and most appropriate first the good featuresbr 1 very nicelooking watch orange dial has a semiglossy almost coppery look hands and markers are very shiny bezel turns easily but wont slip and bezel numbers easy to read rubberplastic strap is plenty long and feels goodnot too thick or stiff but partially molded and shaped to fit wrist watch case has nice size not too thick or heavy but feels very solid and wellmadebr br and the notsogood numbers on subdials impossible to read without magnifier skeletonized minute hand also hard to see in low light very little luminous material on hands especially minute hand sweep second hand seems to have been an afterthought as it is so thin and dark as to be almost invisible in many light conditions full disclosure i need reading glasses for fine print and the glasses help reading this watch but the watch is hard to read easily even with glassesbr overall a nice watch for the price good size for a grown man with sharp eyes watch has a lot more style and good looks than your average dive watch in this price range,1
the bracelet broke after about 2 weeks but i have just used the beads in other jewelry clasp on the necklace opens up easy but i just closed it with plyers and its fine,1
cute but they stay on velcro is very weak,1
wore them once and the silver pin that keeps the clasp connected fell out i now have a useless shirt stay,0
quality is good,2
ok this mask is really cool to look at with that being said it is so uncomfortable for long periods of time the ridge of the nose is hard and puts pressure in a single spot leaving a huge dent in your face if its worn for 10 minutes i also decided to switch out the spikes on the sides of the nose since they blocked my eyes so i unscrewed them and replaced them with smaller spikes the mask also gets really bad condensation inside from wearing it and it gets wet smell is a little unpleasant too it reminds me of a cheap halloween mask and really you cant breathe in it at all its also heavy and the straps dont like to hold it to your face alone aside from the discomfort of actually wearing it it does look cool and works best for photos which is why i bought it if youre looking for a mask to wear in this pandemic i wouldnt recommend it,1
exactly what i ordered,2
terrible product like a childs size i would return it but it would prob cost me more,0
used them for cupcake decorations for halloween and everyone loved them great quality for the price and super cute too,2
great gift,2
originally bought these many years ago at a little amish store in pa they are so comfortable and long wearing i never get up there to pa anymore and was delighted to find them on amazon,2
kick them off of amazon for price gouging,0
shirts run small especially the length 3t fits like 2t and 2t fits like 18m would not buy again,1
their aid says it will fit large to extra large but it is not true the one i received was more like a medium but the tag indicated lxl,0
a little small,0
i love these i bought two im 218lbs and the xxl fits nice not too big or small true to size,2
regret the purchase,0
nice soft well fitting socks wish they were seamless toe,2
keeps my feet warm,2
my main complaint is that the grey colour looks darker in real life than in the photos too dark for me so i returned the collar is also hard to get to lay properlybr br however it fit as expected for me and the fabric is soft and nice quality the length is great if youre taller would be a great fallwinter top for someone else,1
i use this caftan for loungeweari lived my black one so much that i had to order one in red too,2
looks pretty but even 2 sizes bigger will never fit me,0
the purple lenses are so light theres almost no tint cheap plastic that fits horribly theres no adjustment in the face area at all and no padding around the back to uncomfortable to use for just a halloween costume huge disappointment,0
my son loves it and has not been able to wait for halloween so he wears it out to play,2
these socks are awful the heel comes halfway up my leg and falls down throughout the day i have washed several times in hot water trying to shrink them to fit my normal size 75 feet not worth the buy,0
the shirt in general is a little small im not too worried hoping it will loosen up over time however the armpits are the most tight part of the shirt and im worried that will continue to be an annoyance otherwise it fits well and looks nice,1
ive had this shoe about 6 months now overall its a solid shoe dont get me wrong however there are some pitfalls to them first the shoe laces that are built into the shoes are not good at all they loosen a lot and i think they are way too long ive sort of just let them be and the shoe fits me extremely loose now i dont bother sinching the cord up anymorebr br second the soles they arent as slop resistant as id like and they also seem to wear out very quicklybr br the shoes are comfortable so i feel there are always trade offs,1
light weight summer fitness pant,1
same answer they do not work,0
quality was good but it said it was supposed to fit an adult n it didnt should have sent back,2
i am a 32 dd and the 2 straps above the breasts were too big they just hung down i thought it would have fit good cause its stretchy but those two straps were way too big,0
they are not the bet fit going on or off,1
husband and admirers really like this,2
was a gift recipient loves it a little smaller than i thought it would be,2
i didnt like anything about the socks poor quality too small tight fit but the material is not breathable these are more like uncomfortable poorly made trouser socks but less comfy do not by for soccer or sports as they advertise,0
weird fit,0
gorgreous,2
this shirt is so soft and comfortable washes up nicely and letters look readable and big,2
great for the price it didnt turn my finger green like other cheap jewelry,2
so cute and feel soft but sturdy comes with cute prints,2
very cute but didnt come with backs the hooks are thin and i had trouble finding backs that held securely,1
cute,1
simple but classy,2
stretchie bathing suit material looks cheap fits ok,1
these are super ugly and run small the toe box is very tight for this brand very uncomfortable and ugly shoe,0
the dress was too long for my granddaughter not appealing at all,1
is this for a kid or a man i am a size 12 mens shoe,1
great over the shoulder strap until it failed initial impression was very good but half way through my trip in kyoto the metal piece failed and dropped the camera luckily it has a safety strap or it would have been catostrphic made the rest of the trip so much funsarcasm,0
she loves it,2
material is nice and silky but way too small you need to size up at least 2 sizes from what the chart says,0
belt is literally grey whether thats the actual color of the leather or because this is the driest piece of leather ive ever seen in my life i couldnt tell ya i opened the box and the belt seems to be wellmade but was so ashy and dry that i sent it right back does not resemble the product pic in color,0
thought the vent feature would help somehow did not,1
this is a very cute outfit and got lots of comments on it when my granddaughter wore it but i do hate the fact that it has to be ironed especially the shorts every time you wash it maybe if they changed from 100 cotton to something else that would not wad up so bad would be great,2
i love these super comfy slippers ive used dearfoams for years and the last few have totally failed me plus customer service was completely nonexistent so i decided to try some others and these are a big win theyre crazy durable soft and cozy inside but a solid rubber sole for outdoor use i wear these on the back patio and front porch all the time,2
fit is small i wear a lot of 1x size and bout the 2x size for roominess ummway too tight and ive lost weight,1
i did not like how this bra fit and sent it back,0
terrible turned black and neck green,0
i like the site fabric however the crotch area was not made with enough fabric to stay put while u move around constantly needing to readjust a front wedgie while at the office im glad i havent started yoga yet would of been all bad wearing these,0
i got them for myself for christmas and they ended up falling apart after drying them in the dryer i returned them and got a new pair they also were rather small,0
did not cut the glare,1
after wearing the belts a few times they began to peel poor quality,0
very cheap looking almost like a gumball machine ring,0
this is the worst hat i have ever ordered it goes from a terrible color that did not show up on line when i ordered it to a really crappy piece of material i was so disgusted that i gave to my dog to chew up so it would never be sent anybody once again the dog didnt like it eitherhe puked,0
this is a small wallet i needed the smallest wallet possible and this is it its the exact width of a bill the bill fits exactly with zero room to spare it holds a few cards and has an id window the change section has two compartments and zips shut the fastener is magnetic and strongbr br its exactly what i needed but be aware its very small when you order itbr br the print is cute and the material is shiny and its well made i love it,2
love them,2
this is perfect,2
the neck hole was really big and the material was rough and scratchy i returned it,0
fits perfect sixe to fit love the new pouch much more comfort and room,2
this shoe was too narrow not as described unfortunately had to return,0
the slit was way higher and the fabric was too thin return,0
i bought these for my cheer team to wear for bca month in oct they were cute and adorable when they first arrived but after just one time wearing they pink on the ribbon began wearing off by they end of the month keep in mind these where only worn one day out of the week over half the pink sparkles had come one and the bows were limp and didnt stay up,1
dress was right around the arms and not as flowy as i would have liked around the stomach but it for the 3 year old fine however i ordered hers a size larger,1
thick good quality but super small the measurements listed states 94 wide when in actuality when open it actually measures out to 8 wide only purchase if u expect a smaller sized insert otherwise its thick stuff perfect for a smaller bag,1
just ok,1
its a lovely jumpsuit however after reading several reviews on how well it fit on other women who claim to be a particular size i ordered a large for myself my normal size when it arrived i tried it on immediately and it seemed to be a small rather than a large it doesnt fit at allvery disappointing,0
there was a large lump inside the toe of the left boot i was very disappointed i dont know if these are reject boots they are selling or what cant believe that these made it past inspection i would go directly to korkers 4 boots thats what im going to do,0
i liked the material but not the fit for my body shape,1
while the concept is lovely the item arrived broken unable to usewear,0
fits well bright color,2
this material is as described but its a bit larger than my measurements and i did follow their size guide also id advise getting a petticoat to put underneath,1
where to begin the dress is nice and sparkles brightly however the top boob area has this hard wire to form the dress top and it sticks straight up and away from the body leaving a huge gap above the breasts a friend suggested i use lingerie tape to hold it down but the metal wire is so long that if you push the top against your skin the bottom of the wire pops out maybe it was just my body type but the metal wire in the boob area was the thing that ruined the dress for me the side slit is high and the ruffles around it stick almost straight out,0
very pretty however runs small size up 2 sizes,0
does not wick away sweat it actually holds it in,0
when i received it it was very shiny gorgeous but after 6 monthschain is dull blackened all over tried silver wipes polish etcsame black dull color not worth it,0
happy with the purchase,1
yes i do think these slippers are kind of funny looking like a pink sheep and at the same time kind of cute i got a large and they fit my size 9 foot well and they are extremely comfortable they are a very pale pink and perfect for fall and winter as they are also very warm they are the kind of slippers which if you are staying home all day you will not want to take off the bottom sole is rubber so you wont slip on a hard floor although i have not had sherpa slippers before i have had several pair of dearfoams slippers so hope these hold up as well as the ones ive had in the past per the care label these sherpa slippers can be machine washed cold gentle and lay flat to dry i really like these slippers a lot and am happy i got them,2
this shirt was huge and made of very very thin material very poor quality the necklace arrived broken and with paint chipping off i attempted to return the shirt but the shipping to do so was 22 so instead i threw it in the trash buy with caution friends,0
its too big and it looks like a crumpled mess after washing especially the straps its just not flattering at all its not dressy enough for me to put effort in ironing it tbh and its too big and bulky to be worn at home to lounge what a waste,0
las tallas son complicadas me quedo muy grande,2
with arthritis they are hard to get over my headand kindof snug,1
good quality laces ill buy these again if i ever need laces,2
corbusier line line i know it doesnt make any sense why didnt they get me that night,2
purchased the bag and barely used it for a month for my sons daycare and it already ripped at the zipper this is light use for his items and only gets somewhat filled once a week otherwise this bag is not stuffed,0
this was a christmas gift for a nephew arrived a day early which was great coat is cool but it came with unexpected dirt marks down the front of the coat right out of packaging tried to lightly clean it as to not smear markings but it was a stain that was already set bummer just fyi for those wondering xxl is about a an xl in us sizes,0
super cute but kind of small wish i had gotten one size bigger,1
a little short but next size to big,1
the blouse is not boho its old lady it doesnt have full length sleeves theyre 34 length also it has a v neck not a boho collar its at least 3 ft long its the type of shirt heavy set old ladies wear dont waste your money,1
they are not very comfortable,1
large size makes it versatile thin but warm and the goldenrod is a nice color just in time for fall in the adirondacks the beauty in the photos is a 5 4 size medium for comparison,2
very little support good for sleep bra,1
i am very happy with the new cabinet we mounted this over a chair in the bedroom to use as a spare mirror when not being used as a jewelry cabinet the magnetic latch helps keep the door closed but i did need to beef up the wall hangers to make myself feel better i love the design but i think after having it i may have liked an inwall mount unit better but for what this is i think the design is great and i didnt have to cut into the wall,2
did not care for this the pockets were to high,0
great price,2
its ok it had a very strong unpleasant sent i assume it was from the dye it was supposed to be a gift but it smelled to bad so i couldnt give it to the person,1
true to size great show son loves it,2
really like this swimsuit hoping to buy the navy polka dot one next i am 52 145 and b cup fits great all around and shows off my curves recommend this swimsuit to any one looking for something that is sexy cute but hides the 34flaws34 that having children does to a womans body,2
this belt is awesome for the price it is thick and masculine the quality is beautiful dont hesitate to buy it,2
it doesnt look like as is showed it has a poor colors and bad positions for the muscles legs and have the worst fit ive ever seen,0
loved these leggings at firstbr br after wearing maybe 10 times these ripped in the crotch area while i was wearing them at the gym which is something thats never happened to me in any other leggings before,1
item did not fit over the regular glasses,0
pretty color soft size as expected out of the package purchased 2 of misslove gowns and the one with butterflies did not have tags with fabric content or wash instruction noted material was very stretchy not typical of 100 cotton i emailed seller to inquire initial response received 34these nightgown were made of soft blend cotton34 i asked for additional information again referring to amazon description that gowns are 100 cotton 2nd response 34 it adds 5 polyethylene to make it more softerand we will edit the description at once34br i specifically shopped for 100 cotton gowns buyer beware,0
we got this to 34crown34 our boss for a special achievement it needed to serve only the purpose of presenting him with a crown but its actually pretty solid our office is not an oligarchy so he doesnt wear it daily but it is 34nice34 enough that he leaves it in his office as decoration it would definitely withstand more than one evening of costume parties if thats what its purchased for,2
not worth 20 not padded and material is very cheap,0
a little large,2
they are cute some of the straps broke on first use of our trip,0
decent quality at best but no targeting piece dont your money,0
do not buy if you have any kind of hips or curves but going by the size chart i cant even return them bc its a hassle and i have to pay shipping too so disappointed,0
the velcro on this band broke down quickly,0
so i just got it n b4 my bday n im supper happy about that i love the way it looks n yes small n not a real crystal but its still gorgeous,1
i keep my hair oiled but not too crazy the oils sunk through the cap and made an oil stain,1
this was a very thin flimsy fabric and sized way too small had to return it,0
made a bit cheaply it could be reinforced better,1
the smell the smell the smellbr it came out eventually but it room like 45 washes my coats a year old and i can still smell it faintly,1
i like the way this shirt fits around the shoulders and arms for a golf outing the material was slightly rougher and stiffer than i originally expected but it probably adds to its durability i am not crazy about how the textured wrist cuffs look and feel different from the rest of the shirt as seen in the picture but overall it is a good quality long sleeve collared shirt,2
product runs large,1
it is cute and i love the feathers slight natural greenish tint in them it says it is adjustable by sliding along the headband mine seems to be stuck also the felt circles that are hot glued to the headband and decorative part were not completely glued together making the decorative part wobbly on the headband i have a hot glue gun and will just finish the gluing process after seeing the product i would have rather paid less but i really want to wear this to a wedding to try and make fascinators a thing the us so i will keep it and make the repairs myself,1
nothing about these shorts worked im a size 6 and yet i ordered a 10 and they were still too small like sausage casings also i know the whole 80s yard sale style is really popular right now but they dont look good on anyone ive literally seen no one wearing jeans or shorts like this in the wild looking good its an awful look and i thought i could hide it on these shorts by having my shirts hang over the waist but the cut of pockets are so high way up on the small of your back nope,0
i ordered according to the directions and these would not even come close to fitting definitely not plus sized also they were not the color that i had selected however had they fit i think that they would have been great as they were a nice material and cute,1
the size was not big enough even though it said it was,1
this shirt is a tight fit and runs small however the picture quality is nice i just cant wear it as much as i wanted,1
i loved the charm it was used on a bracelet for a special friend,2
its a good quality product but its a tee shirt and i was expecting a mock turtleneck that rises a little more on the neck,2
ordered this bracelet for my son not true to size what so ever more for new borns my son is 2,0
very nice the chain started to fade after about 2 weeks but the text seems to stay gold i never showered with it,1
cute dress but unfortunately the style didnt work for me,1
too small in torso and not enough give in the shoulder strap adjustments cutting him off in the crotch,1
shirt said loose fitting and wasnt in my opinion pretty color,0
loved this little holder for my id and credit cards so handy,2
they were so cute,1
straps are big and i feel like i need to hold on to the slipper on my foot as i walkbr considering returning it or perhaps giving it as a gift to someone with bigger feet,1
werent comfortable or fit the way it said,0
my daughter was accepted to notre dame nd and i ordered these pajama pants for her to wear when she goes off to nd but shes already wearing them and loves them and wears it often she said they are very comfortable and soft,2
terrible quality returned,0
these mens gloves are just what i was looking for to give as gifts came in plastic bag separating left and right glove allowing for nice presentation,2
unflattering boxy cut and so short,0
waistband a bit stiff and tight but pants are comfy and flattering prefer the pink i bought both,1
love the packaging and the quality it was worth the buy,2
small for the sizes get kne size up,1
bought this strap to wear with the pochette accessoires that came with the multi pochette i absolutely love this strap it looks authentic,2
daughter loves so do i,2
love it,2
it came in with no instructions and its no way it was a 2xl i couldnt even get my arms in cotten coming out just a complete waste of money,0
made a macgruber costume this wig is super cheap so youre not worried about it it looks great too id recommend getting a wig cap to put under it as its not the most comfortable wig ive ever worn but for the price this thing is great,2
i love love love this dress im 411 168lbs and ordered the large it fit perfect,2
looked cheap not great material,0
very supportive not soft life memeory foam but will last a lot longer,2
wouldnt buy again,1
cute i bought this for my 9 year old neice unfortunately the clasp broke instantly its fixable with some effort,1
i ordered this sweaterwhen i received it it had an oil stain on the front of it i sprayed it let it set then i scrubbed it with my finger and it came off i kept it because i liked it but it definitely had been worn before i m very disappointed,0
great boot but size is way off its about a halfsize one size larger than advertised so order a halfsize one size smaller than usual,2
i normally wear a large in shorts and i ordered an xl and these were skin tight definitely go up a few sizes,0
so i have a hard time finding bras in general because most stores dont carry a 32b rather frustrating so when i ordered this i was a little nervous about how it would fit i love it it fits very well and when i exercise its very supportive i have been using it for about 6 months so it has been tested it has held up well going through the washer i dont put it in the dryer but it has been accidentally put in by my family a few times and it hasnt shown any signs of coming apart i would definitely recommend this to everyone and i have i dont write reviews that often but this deserve one,2
these earrings are beautiful the only thing that would improve this purchase is if the vendor included earring stoppers so they wont wiggle out of the earlobe other than that very happy with these wear them a lot,2
cute and comfortable the colors are pretty material is thin great spring shirt,1
soft and silky material my daughter loves this shirt,2
great quality good fit extremely comfortable will purchase again,2
pliers dont have grip and the tips are too big for the shoe hole,0
i had hoped the light would be brighter i purchased this to be better seen while riding my bike,1
these boots are positively comfortable and warm it was a high of 21 degrees today and i slipped these boots on that i just received today and went outside for over 2 hours and my feet were toasty warm love the fact that these boots were so easy to get on and off easy to lace up unbelievable for comfort and stylish i hope they wear well because i have been looking for boots that are warm and comfortable and these outshine the others i ordered and sent back the other boots were a lot more expensive and i couldnt even wiggle my feet in them these are easy on easy off and comfy and perfectly warm love these boots,2
this robe is so soft and cozy its really comfortable and does not feel heavy when wearing im 5 foot 3 and did not have to shorten it its just right the robe washes and dries in the machines nicely a very good buy,2
man i love this kimono fits perfect and a great color plus a cool heron or egrit embroidered on one side great price too,2
comfortable,2
poor material,0
got a lot of people laughing,2
very comfy and warm but not too hot just right,2
ive purchased it for my wife working outside during the cold observing others the vest just didnt last long or didnt keep her center top comfortable in above freezing conditionsbr poor performance,0
pretty sturdy lenses are great glasses slip a bit,1
this is see through very cheaply made i bought a 2xl us and it is more like a womens large it is very short and seams are cheaply sewn very disappointed and would never buy again,0
as already have one l pair bough an s pair for my fiancee now can safely hold side life line of an inflatable boat without hurting her hand palm fit is quite comfy for extended use along element protection highly recommended,2
no fly,1
this product looks like great quality would buy again,2
i like the material and the quality but the dye bleeds onto lighter colors,0
these are a pretty shade of wine red and stretchy as i need due to a med condition i am 5 5 and 240 lbs i accumulate fluid in my abdomen so i needed something to fit all the time which these do they were a bit long but not so long you walk on them the only thing i noticed is after the first wash they slighted pilled,2
i have worn these maybe 56 times the thread is starting to come out and they are starting to become fuzzy,1
love this shirt its so flowy and its a great material it doesnt stay off the shoulder you do have to pull it down quite often but i love it fits as expected,2
fit my 56 year olds feet well but they already seem like my kid will wear them out before he outgrows them used to buying name brand products ie nike or adidas and was hoping for a cheaper alternative the name brands for whatever reason seem to last longer with running out rock climbing than these shoes they are fine for an extra pair of shoes but may not hold up very well if used as a primary pair for an active kid,1
i was really disappointed with this piece the size was perfect its 1 inch across so people complaining about size must be talking about how delicate it looks it is flimsy and the arms of the flake bend easily my biggest gripe is that the 34texture34 stamped into the metal dulls the shine silver should have a few months later it was tarnished and even with silver polish the piece is gray and dull looking also the loop on back that the chain runs through is too small and only my smaller silver chain would go through it,0
nice but clasp isnt very tight,1
cheap alternative to the expensive bug name brands fits nice good pockets waist fits a little big usually wear 3436 depending on brand,2
not compression and not to size,0
loves this jacket apart from the pockets where not sow properly so i had to resow both both pockets,1
i ordered a large i wear a size 38c bra 35 inch waist 53 160 lbs it fit nicely and not too revealing the material is a little thick which is good but maybe a little too warm to wear during warmer summer days unless wearing with shorts and flip flips it was long enough on me that i could wear it with leggings the back is longer than the front which is good because it covers my culo very pretty top glad i ordered it ive enclosed some pictures i hope this review helps,2
socks were not variety pack as displayed i received the same socks with the same prints on them,0
i purchased this bag for my trip a cruise to the bahamas i carried this bag with me during my time on the islands it is beautiful bag the writing is more gold than the picture shows a plus for me its an oversized bag and can hold a lot although i would recommend only carrying a few items i would typically carry sunscreen 2 bottles of water 16oz lip gloss a change of clothes beach towel wallet my camera and small souvenirs that i grabbed on the island by day 4 i noticed that the stitching that attached the handles to the bag are starting to pop i would have expected to use it for more than just one tripbr br pros beautiful bag easy to match with beachvacation attire roomybr br cons not sturdy no zipper for the smaller pocket inside,1
beautiful dress however it was a little too big for me and it was missing a button im giving it 3 s because it came to me missing a button,1
its ok,1
this was a few sizes too small and i had already sized up definitely size up several sizes,1
not only did they not look like advertisement they are super small i didnt even attempt to try them on i love green and was excited when these came across my screen i was so disappointed i returned them immediately,0
the actual watch is big and seems to be of good quality the band itself is total garbage ive worn this watch maybe 5 times and the band just simply tore apart i have a graveyard of invicta watches with torn bands i dont recommend rubber strap watches from invicta,1
nice as expected,2
i am a diabetic i spray the inside of the socks with skineeze spray before putting them on the spray keeps my legs moisturized all day long and the compression makes my legs no longer ache and keeps the swelling to a minimum,2
works great,2
the colors are full not vivid as pictured they are more earthy than exuberant i had wanted the bright colorsbr br also they arent very plush and not soft i dont like them at all they are just 34meh34,1
the color assortment is great and look great but i have trouble with them sliding off when i wear them while exercising was hoping to wear them in our convertible when we have the top down and while bike riding definitely wont work for me for either of those,1
good,2
this dress was awful when you raise your arms the whole dress comes up super tight,0
normally an anticipated trait though this gator neck is a tad small for my 65ness i have a few others cotton and synthetic blends that have good 3d stretch this products is very tight around while having good length stretch decent product not my fit or material blend,1
these were very nice in the beginning however the cheap elastic that supports the straps just snapped as i was walking to work i maybe wear these once or twice a month in warmer weather so not much usage in a year to justify this im very disappointed as ive never paid this much for sandals and i expected them to last forever stick to real birkenstocks people,0
my lo weighs almost 12 pounds at 3 months and this is still pretty big on her i didnt care for the fabric quality either i thought it was going to be a softer cotton but its not shipped on time and in good condition though we will make it work,1
it looks nice and expensive i just wish it wasnt that big too big for my wrist i will give it to my sister who is bigger than mebr make sure you ask the seller for a smaller size,2
the bestbr best sizebr best weightbr best service,2
the last triple sensor casio watch i had lasted for about 17 years no battery replacement or other issues until the lcd screen started to smudge and fade out lots of scratches falls and wear but reliable to the endbr br this one is an eye catcher and am expecting the same tough reliability,2
i checked carefully for any defects couldnt find any jacket is well made and comfortable i needed a jacket with zipped pockets and this one is perfect no lost items when you go for a jog or brisk walk or anything else i highly recomemend it,2
bought these for my 11 year old daughterfit well when tried onthen washed once and they literally shrunk to half their size or smaller,0
the lenses are not near as good as oakley for the price they are ok,1
love it,2
sizing off didnt fit and to return,1
wow really designer looking very stylish,2
made very nicely but i found it too bulky and heavy even when empty as a senior i wanted a wellmade but light weight card case i returned it,1
videoid6861f35c212c77f895a527b4a7f70b1 the shirt are amazing quality is superb even after washing it,2
womens blouse was very thin amp way too small i ordered a very large top amp when it arrived i was so disappointed bcuz to would only fit a young girl,0
softpretty fabric,2
fits great warm holds up in the wash,2
there is really nothing wrong with these glasses they are well made they are just to large for my face i chose to keep them however to keep at my bedside for evening reading,1
im so disappointed with these i am 55 and these dont even come up to my knees they only reach 3 below the knee they are so short that they are uncomfortable i would only recommend these to a person who is short in stature,0
bought 5 of them price was good husband tried on when we got them fit perfect until i washed them he is tall and thin and likes xl cant return because i washed them all before he was to wear them order bigger size,1
i am autistic and i have a hard time wearing underwear having sensory issues makes feeling comfortable with materials against my crotch difficult these are great the material is a shiny silky material and you easily forget they are there,2
ordered yellow and its borderline mustardorange not the end of the world but they were purchased as part of a costume so it was tricky to get the colors to match not bad for the price,1
the tunnels are at least a full millimeter larger than the ends of the tapers and the nonflared edges are very sharp after pushing the tapers through i was not able to get the tunnel in after a bloody mess too had to size back and start all over again with a different set the black coating on the tapers also started chipping off before i even attempted to put them inbr br i consulted my piercer about this experience and she informed me that standard sizing is different in other countries i suspect these are manufactured outside of the us so sizing differences may be part of the problem here or just quality control problems either way steer clear,0
its just as pictured its perfect for me i have a very small wrist and it adjusts nicely,2
these were ok at first for the pool but tore up very quickly,1
beware although is says its for silver gold etc the instructions saydo not use on gold so i am disappointed in this i bought it to polish my wedding ring,1
the advertisement looked great the shirt itself is fine but the graphics are lacking dull in order to present a 3d effect,0
slim wrist have challenge to tighten pattern cool,1
theyre stretchy so theyll fit broader thighs but the heart gets stretched and distorted doesnt look right they are also pretty long but i am only 53 so a lot of clothes are too long for me lol,1
material was flimsy and the armhole area gapped in a sloppy way,0
i wear a 105 or 11 these are too small,1
unreal faux,1
very pretty vibrant colors on this mermaid bag it was a gift and the little lady really liked it,1
good fit and appearance but the material seems to pick up lint cat hairs,1
love it i always get complimented when i wear this and my response is always 34amazon34 cute for summer and fallwinter with some leggings underneath and boots,2
jacket looks nothing like that pant was tight everywhere but in the waist color looks different also dont like the material largebr 56 170lbs,0
very small purse but good materal,1
my daughter says this is fantastic shes a total wonder woman fan,2
these shoes are going to the homeless they hurt the bottom of my feet and way too spongy didnt give enough support of course you never know how shoes feel until you wear them a few times,0
the fabric isnt what i expected you get what you pay for,1
great fit,0
it fit pretty large i have gained a lot of weight and got the xl and it was really too big i have to order another type of dress for my trip this weekend but i would order this again without hesitation after i lose a few pounds i love the pockets,1
i normally buy similar large hanes shirt at walmart but this one was bit small to start with then shrunk from large to medium,0
material is way to thin sizing accurate,1
best watch i have ever purchased i have been a citizens client for five years and this eco driven watch is by far the best one yet the solar energy eco drive is genius,2
nah wont wear it cheap fabric too,1
i bought these as everyday earrings they are considerably smaller than anticipated,1
i did not like this outfit nothing about it was flattering the fit was weird the materiel was disappointing and itchy the shorts rolled up weirdly on the sides where the color band was like the shorts material was less sturdy than the decorative part the top was thin and see through disappointed,0
i ordered a small and the bottoms were a little loose the top was cute good quality but also a little loose though it has adjustable straps i thought about keeping it just to use the tankini top but decided i didnt love it that muchbr it was returned,0
perfect ordering 1 of every color,2
product is great slow to get it worth the wait,2
great product very easy to fit to desired length,2
i ordered the necklace as a birthday gift but the star was hard to see it wasnt bright as it looked in the picture so i returned it other than that it seemed to be fine,0
works well for an all cotton bra,1
beautiful look much more expensive than it is,2
this print is ugly it doesnt look like in the photo and the ups left the package in my yard so the do dog ate it,0
did not come in navy was a very odd blue color fit well but very disappointed in the color,0
fabric is very light weightw the smallish fit i returned it,1
i ordered this for chemo but it is too small for a blanket and necessities after chemo it will be a great size for appointments wallet treats yarn blanket airpods meds chapstick odds and ends necessary it also attracts dirt lint and dog hair very cute,0
itchy,0
i ordered this in dark grey and loved how stretchy and slinky the dress was then i got it in the green color and the material is way different wayyy more cotton feeling,1
looked weird on me might be cute on you though lovely color,1
the shirt is nice but the arm length is quite short i dont have very long arms so for it not to fit my arm length is odd every other part fit fine,1
decent but im not so sure about onesizefitsall if its a little tight on my head,1
summarybr the ring has very good build quality ive had it for 2 years and wear it everyday the spinning mechanism works fine the alphabet color is still good however the ring can scratch easily even though it is made of stainless steel,2
i was really excited about this shirt cause its super cute and made with a material thats not super soft but is comfortable however unfortunately within the first few hours of wearing it where the ruffle hem is in the lower half of the shirt it started ripping it doesnt seem to be sewed together very well so now i have a couple small gaps in the shirt where if i accidentally pull on it ill have areas of my stomach showing br but great customer service they gave me a refund and apologized and said that they would be talking with their manufacturer to prevent this from happening again,1
im a huge fan so i purchased this but i feel its expensive and it takes forever to iron out the flag flat i wish they would roll this up and ship it instead of folding it into a thousand squares,1
ive only used this belt once so far but it worked good i like that it is so adjustable if you are looking for something to keep your pants in place it works but if you are looking for something to hold your gut in its not going to do that,2
i love brahmin bags and this color is so fun yet elegant,2
not what i expected at all very small,0
this shoe is a bit tighter than my other size 44 ecco shoes but the shoe fits snug and really protects my feet at the end of the day my feet do not hurt anymore as to the quality this shoe is not as visually appealing as my other ecco dress casual shoes but still looks good also on this shoe i would have to say for a slip on its a tad harder to get on my foot than my other ecco brand slip on shoes the quality is great however i think that this shoe is designed to last a long time my only fear is on the heel and how it will hold up given that this shoe is a little hard to put on and unless you use a shoehorn you may see some premature wear on the back,2
exactly as ordered great quality colour fits my large driving sunglassesplus reading glasses so the case is a good size,2
i use these as an every day handkerchief if a bench is wet after rain i will wipe it down with a bandana i will blow my nose into one when im stuffy it serves as a heavy duty napkin that adds a bit of panache to my ensemble with color and design that being said they are only one sided and the material is not to my liking in the future i will look for a thicker version of this bandana that has a clear design on both sides i will also only order in packs of colors that i use most often the white lavender teal and purple colors get left in the bottom of the drawer,1
i love vionic sand lies but these hurt the crisscross is on the top of the shoe,1
picture is blurry on the fronta little disappointed as i get a lot of these shirts with no issues,1
so bad i cant believe someone sells them cut my finger first time i put them on,0
garbage dont waste your money arm snapped after 3rd wear,0
the fit is good and they are soft on the inside so a thumbs up for comfort however the warmth just isnt there as other reviews have implied just walking the dog in mid forties weather my fingers especially the tips got a bit cold so for outdoor exercise or light work i gave a three grip is good for driving and not bulky so for the price over all not a terrible glove,1
they are made from very thin cloth no padding at all i got the small ones yet they still slide down during the course of the day,0
perfect great quality my granddaughter loves them,2
i read the reviews and ordered a size up just to be safe still a little too small on me but it is very cute and seems very well made illbr probably give away as a present,1
dont like it br itches a lot,0
delivery was on time but the mask just doesnt work once you put on the mask the part that goes over the bridge of your nose goes all the way up to your eyes the loops on ears are way too small and they pull your ears down the look is nice but the concept of this mask is just not working,0
looks really pretty,2
im very curious to find out who the people leaving these reviews are because the fit was most certainly not 34perfect34 as many of them have said im a size 8 so at first i bought the skirt in a medium and it was ridiculously small it looked like it was made for a doll so i figured id go up a size right well the large is just as small whos making these and what measurements are they using this is ridiculous im 5534 and 130lbs im curvy sure cause im latina but i should not have this much trouble figuring out my size for thesebr horrible experience,0
got these to use as sweatbands during workouts they are not thick enough to keep sweat out of your face theyre decent as masks or casual bandanas but dont even think too hard because sweat will just roll right through it,1
cute not too big for a 1 year old did not aggravate his ears,2
was smaller than i expected but it is a pretty piece,1
my wife went from a 96 to 10 with the help of these bad boys,2
i love the color they are lightweight and very pretty,2
i bought the vneck red in a size medium as recommended by the record and size chart i am 53 145 lbs it was too small and not a vneck when i tried to zip it up it want to be off the shoulder and more of a boatneck the zipper is not a very good quality so i would say id youre planning on buying this dress size up to allow the zipper some forgiving space,0
this bracelet is very pretty but my niece bent it just trying to put it on her wrist it is flimsy as some others reported i hope it holds up as it was a gift for her,1
too big and would need ironing after each wash material not suited for care free use,0
i love the ways these feel they fit great and support great i have 10 of them so yes im happy with them,2
ordered these for a friend and she really seems to like them,2
extremely comfortable and great quality,2
i use them in the water and going to the store very versatile,2
the dress fit okay but the sleeves are puffier than i expected and it wound up looking a little too much like a school marm outfit for my tastes it was also kind of on the snug side i got an xl and i usually wear a 1618,1
they are really comfortable would definitely recommend gotta try them you will buy them,2
slides off when taking the glasses off,0
these are exactly what i wanted a slipper to slide into to go down to the basement replacing my downstairs shoes they have a nice gripping sole and i have taken the trash out wearing them i ordered size 12d and they are commodious not tight at all i believe you can trust the sizing price and delivery were excellent,2
breaks easily at jump ring,1
my high school grandson loves it,2
thanks,2
cheap dont waste your money,0
i wouldnt say these are high quality or beautiful but for the price theyre about what youd expect theyre fun hoops but nothing id wear every day,1
dont use on real leather absorbs horribly ruined a beautiful pair of boots but not too many options for grey so but no i do not recommend this grey pasty stuff,0
this necklace reminds me so much of the one from the movie titanic its absolutely lovely the center stone is super sparkly i like the chunky chainbr br it is clearly a piece of costume jewelry you can feel it when you pick it up its very lightweightbr br overall a very pretty necklace that will garner you a ton of compliments,2
these are super cute comfortable and the pocket it big enough for my phone,2
perfect dress,2
ordered a 3xl for the extra bagginess way too short and definitely not 3x feels like one of those sponges you use to wash cars way too snug for me especially a 3x this is a joke,0
one eye is off yet ok was going to return gave to my friend who loves it,1
looks like a plain gray scarf green color is very faint,0
bottoms fit fine but the top is not meant for the chest size of medium to large busts,0
very cute dress easy fit though after first wash dress looked pretty rough attached is a closeup photograph of the dress after only two washings i suggest handwashing and hangdrying if you want to keep the dress nicer longer,1
this looks like a 3rd grade art project it is felt felt with some cheap things attached to it the clasp and metal connector dont even rise to the level of costume jewelry terrible i figure i can wear it this halloween,0
its much shorter than it appears on the model had to return it,0
so cute fits perfect i bought a medium if you want a looser look id get the the next size up i love the wood look buttons and the lace is so pretty,2
these socks are fine in comfort and style but i specifically wanted some navy colored sock because that is what i wear with jeans these are so dark that they look black the only way i could tell they were navy was to put them up against something black and i could see the faintest blue tint no what i wanted if you are looking thin mens socks this are decent but if you are looking for navy keep looking,1
i wanted to like these so much ultimately the fit was just all wrong for an apple shaped person they fit my waist and were baggy around my butt and thighs if i went down a size i felt they would be too tight in the waistbr they did seem like they would be relatively cool in the heat and the color i purchased was a lovely plum color,1
beautiful sweater true to size xl purchased,2
a hassle putting it on buttons kept unsnapping a bit long but that was cool to keep pants dry,1
i wanted a longer looser fit the fabric is pretty thin will keep as a spare shirt,1
it wasnt what i expected,0
these look great no complaints about that however for some reason they made them with no extra room in the chain on the clasp sideits right against the choker never had a piece of jewelry like that the widest choker is extremely difficult to maneuver its stupid especially if you have acrylic nailsdont even bother buying unless there is someone around to take it on and off for you lol,0
had to repair it plastic look to it worked for event,2
quality is fine but the leg holes are so large that they constantly ride up not very comfortable,0
perfect fit,2
sleek accurate and light just what a guy needs not a stone weight on his arm beautiful,2
i own a pair of literide sneakers so i was curious to see how these sandals compare lightweight and stylish for sure material is rubbery so im almost certain that feet will be sweaty in the summer blister alert length is perfect i like the velcro closure front strap allows for a surprisingly wide fit yet my big toe hangs off it seems that unlike the roomy toebox of the classic crocs clogs the shape of the front of these sandals is designed for feet that have spent decades in tight shoes with toes crammed not for my feet,0
they color isnt as great as the pink and green pairs they look purple on the computer screen but in person they are more of a light smoky grey not much to look at,1
just what i needed to bend my metal blanks into bracelets,2
good quality and nice colors but feel very tight around calves and i dont have heavy legs,1
the pins that came with the kit dont even work for the gear,0
i sent several emails back and forth had a bridal shop do the sizing too dress came in a bag all bunched up and strings hanging everywhere from it to long to tight why did i waste my time with emails to make sure it was rightwhat a waste of money,0
very smooth on the skina silky feel i feel very pretty wearing it the actual size is a bit big but once you tie the stringbelt it drapes off the body nicely,2
maybe im not cleaning it often enough or im not cleaning things for long enough but when following the instructions i really havent noticed much of a change with my rings,1
the realbr purchased small im 54 135lbs good fitnot to tightbr pros comfortable shipped on time fit as expected good length similar to photobr cons shipped poorly see photo attached lines are not equally aligned see photos material slightly shiny and not the quality nor material expectedbr unable to decide at this time if i should return or wear as sleep wear nevertheless my recommendation would be to purchase a sold colorbr please hit helpful if my review helped you in anyway thank you so much,1
comfortable material feels good on skin just that its made of a bit transparent material,1
i like it but really on the large size compared to the size chart listed i need to wear another tank usually clothes on amazon seem on the smaller size but not this one im a 36d i think i need two size smaller,1
way to many duplicates mostly girl designs and very little boyish designs,1
very cheap fabricbr extremely poor sewing on this itembr completely dissatisfied and returned as soon as possible,0
nice warm attractive gloves but you have to hold your hand just so to manipulative the touch screen and its more like pawing no way to do anything requiring precision,1
when it arrived the material was a bit itchy and not very soft or comfortable i washed it in cold water and dried on low and then it was much softer and comfortable i like the shade of pink but i dont really like the fit could look cute with the right outfit though i think,1
the description says for girls age 712 years old when i got the socks they were too small i think the description should say toddlergirl shoe sizes 712 instead of years my daughter is average height and has normal skinny feet and is almost 9 years old these socks may have fit her little fee when she was 35 size description too confusing or simply miss labeled,0
while the pattern on this dress is cute and the cut is nice the material is a lycralike legging material and very thin if this wasnt for an indoor photo shoot where i didnt have to worry about sunlight hitting on me id likely have to wear a slip underneath,1
i dont like that the leggings fall down and im not buying a garter belt,0
this belt is so cute with so many outfits the fit is great since i am very petite and it is always so hard to find belts to fit my 2534 waist it is a little cheaply made the bow is just glued on so you have to be carefully not to pull on it when takin kit off i think it would be an easy fix if it does come off just use a glue gun to attach again overall very cute grate fit but not the best made product,2
i did not like the scratchy material it also is to small for an extra large it is super uncomfortable can not wear,0
this item came to me as a square hard block of something resembling uncooked ramen noodles definitely was not clothing i returned it,0
i bought these after reading all of the great reviews they are definitely comfortable and they fit really well i love them but noticed today after wearing them just under two months and walking 2 miles a day that the soles are already worn out i only wear them for my morning walk and not during the day so i think thats not a lot of use to be worn out already,1
good fit but came apart after first use zipper got stuck in sequins and was fun to take off fringe also falling off at bottom of dress beautiful colors,1
i bought this for my 3 year old daughter as she has wanted to be a mermaid ever since she watched the little mermaid i opened the package and she totally fell in love with it she put it on and did not want to take it off she was very upset with me when she had to take the mermaid tail off to get in the carseat to leave the quality of the suit is great and soft and the colors are quite vividbr br i buy all clothes for my daughter in a size 4 so i bought this in a size 45 and it is a little big for her this is my fault as i should have looked at the measurement chart before ordering so i definitely recommend doing this before purchasing i received a discount on this product for my honest review i hope this helps,2
adequate if you like snug socks,1
worst suit i ever boughtthe style and fit is impossible to wear and you pay to return it just say no to ann cole garbage suits,0
best quality i have found good price i own almost all colors,2
color wasnt true to picture a bit more tan than expected,1
the pattern design on the dress and the seams are way off not what is discrived on online its horrible i would not wear this out in public i would definatley not recommend to buy quality is horrible,0
way way too small than normal size in the us merchant told me it is not worth returning to them merchant does not want to make any kind of deal i am very disappointed,0
felt very bulky and awkward,0
the size was perfect the color is exactly as displayed,2
no good for me looked worse than not using them at all just too light and too obvious,0
i liked the periwinkle blue accent against the bra however this bra lacks the support and flexibility necessary to make it a good sports bra there is definite bounce the cups are unlined there are seams that run up the center of the cups they are uncomfortable and irritating okay for lounging but the design is not comfortable or suitable for vigorous activity,1
had to have them shortened,0
based on the other reviews i was looking forward to receiving the yellow earrings i got them today and theyre hideous big chunky thick unpolished like an uncut diamond looks like a bit like a rockrough dull cloudyuntil its finished and the color these earrings are not yellow theyre like a guldens mustard brownish gold yuck im not even sure theyre worth my time and effort to return them they might go straight into the trash before i call it a day,0
visually good look lets see how it works,2
runs small cheap price cheap material you get what you pay for,0
the wallet is very usefull and comfortable high quality materials 100 recommended,2
pretty but just a little large in the chest for me,2
i am 55 and weigh 165 i am a bit curvy at the hips have a 36d bust dress was too tight at the thighs i bought a mediumi was not a fan of how it looked after it was tied at the waist the material was nice thicker than i expected,1
go with your gut i read the reviews and did not listen because i liked the print so i wanted it i ordered this to match my husband for our daughters 1st luau this did not fit at all reason being is that it does not have any material that makes it stretch for women who are bigger on top it just flattens you the quality is not all there either the print is nice but it just seems as if they cut out a pattern and stitched it up hope this helps,1
i love these socks and order some every couple of monthsbr theyre the lightest ever but could be more visit effective,2
lost ball within days,0
super cute loved them,2
queda muy justo y como que se bajabr talvez es por la tela es caliente pero no me gusto que tenía que andarme lo subiendo,1
i ordered what is pictured here and a different set i got two of the same thing and they were smashed becuase the packing was horrible really surprized becuase bundle monster is normally a great seller i contacted them and it still hasnt been replaced,0
have not worn it yet but i did try it on and its kool,2
3 star product supportive compression surpassed previous brands havent seemed to weaken over time and are still appropriately tightbr i got the black pairs and they have unfortunately faded to a grayish black if youre wearing them with black uniform pants there is a distinct difference in black and this faded colorbr also see picture the compression fabric holds them folded in the washerdryer they have developed an even more faded fold line down the middle of each sockbr so if you want good compression and dont care if they fade or have a weird line these do the job,1
low rise waist feels terrible,0
i am thin petite have small feet these slippers are narrow on me but they are very warm comfortable was a good price,1
prombr she looked gorgeousbr very pleased,2
love the swim diaper the design is very cute and it fits my son great the snaps also make it super easy to take off when its wetbr br taking off two stars because i paid extra for a prime item and it took 5 days to get here it didnt even ship until the day it was supposed to be delivered,1
it fits perfectly and very confortable,2
i thought they would fit a little large but that was not the case but i do like the looks and hopefully they will break in and be more comfortable,1
would not buy again,0
thank you,2
the minnie mouse costume was very cheap ours rip on seem about 1 hour of wearing it we thought this would be better costume than one found at walmart due to buying on amazon not any different than walmart costumeexcept 20 dollars more i would not buy this again i usually dont take time to fill out review but my 2 yo daughter was very sad when dress ripped,0
this is a wellconstructed hat at a reasonable price with good materials however its not slouchy in any way and if you squint or move your head the entire thing falls off not enough stretch to keep it in place it might do fine with shorter hair but i guarantee the woman in the picture has to sit still smiling that way lest her cap fly off,0
poor fabric and fabrication thinthrew it away,0
i purchased one a few months backnow they come with a yellowbrownish color on the bottom half of the lensesnot a fan because its very noticeable in pictures and even while wearing them,1
well fitting mens briefs that are comfortable,2
came with a crystal missing,0
a little large but not uncomfortable nice clor plaid,2
great price,2
love love love these have 4 so that i can change up when i am on vacation and going to the beach every day get compliments from everyone about how nice they are love them,2
this is a 5 star watch i marked it 3 so people might read the reason why save themselves a return i have arthritis in my hands never imagined it would affect a watch the band has no 34give34 when open i could just barely get it over my thumb index finger joint near my hand once i had it on my wrist i realized at least 23 links would need to be removed to fit my tiny wrist then i would never get the watch on the watch is gorgeous it is a muted pink not a loud cheap looking pink the band part is a pale pink color i love it the watch case is a little darker pink but so very classy i am so sad as i just love this watch one other thing i noticed is that is feels fairly heavy in weight compared to other watches i have owned but nothing that would cause me to return it they say the ceramic is baked on at a high temperature that may be what is adding the weight also i have read other watch reviews that state the colored stainless steel bands chip i doubt very seriously this band will chip,1
these socks are ok theyre pretty but theyre not quite soft enough also they feel like they dont have enough elastic and will slouch down a lot i havent worn them more than trying them on so if i feel differently after wearing them ill change my review but out of the box i wasnt impressed with anything but the price,1
i needed organization for my laptop backpack and settled on this one watching the video it looks like it holds 85x11 inch paper but its just a smidge short the description doesnt say it will hold a full sheet of paper so they didnt misrepresent their product just be aware otherwise its an okay organizer had i read more carefully i might have selected a different one this one doesnt seem very sturdy so im not sure how long it will last,1
love these shoes i have wide feet so i have to break them in a little bit more then they will be just right,2
a very nice jersey be warned the sizing is cn not us look a the size chart and measure your chest a large is like a small in us sizes,2
i have several dakine bags and backpacks for self and 3 daughters they are all great much higher quality than most backpacks my elementary school daughters use grom backpacks for school and they are perfect size both for a kid and for a woman i like them for when i dont have to carry my laptop the wonder backpack is fairly similar size but less good than the grom the shape is slightly less ergonomic its wider at the bottom and sticks into my back a bit also theres no outer pocket which is useful for keeping wallet and keys or pencil case separate from other items if youre choosing between them go with the grom,1
i purchased this suit to get more secure coverage for water therapyexercise the traditional crossracer back suits for lap swimming are secure but theyre more difficult to get onoff with a 34i chest and still dont cover high enough this suit comes up all the way in the back almost like a tshirt would and is easy onoff while still being secure due to the zipper being fully functional i find that the high back does annoy me a bit on the back of my neck but i think that may be due to my chest pulling it forward i purchased an xl based on reviews and the fact that i have a large bust i would prefer a smaller size for the lower half of my body 14 to avoid the extra fabric and have it be a little more snug but needed the space up top so i stuck with the xl i do think it depends on your body shape considering the other reviews so you may want to take that into account i have wide hips and find the bottom to be decent fitting overall a very good suit holding up well after chlorine use 5x per week and soakingrinsing afterwards before hand wash,2
awesome little bolo just what i needed,2
beautiful and well made,2
pretty dress however sequins falling off a soon as i tried it on ordered my normal size and its too tight will be returning,1
color is wrong not the same as pictured runs smallbr this is the 2nd time i have ordered these boots for my daughter the first time the boot pictured was pink wtan fur trim i received pink with white fur trimbr this time around the boot was supposed to be brown wtan fur i got brown w white fur im so annoyedbr will not order again,0
thought it was going to be cotton but was a polyester blend,1
good,1
the water bottle pockets are in a truly bizarre location it is impossible to use without taking the pack off your back otherwise this a supersafe pack with cool features,1
the shirt fits fihe and the fabric is soft and washed wellbr i just thought that the decal looked cheap as opposed to 2 other shirts i purchased it has no glitter or decorative trimming just the pressed picturebr it is fine as a workout topper to go shopping during the holidays but you couldnt wear it to a more festive occasion,1
looks cute but is kinda thin expected it to be more thick,1
nice assortment nice to wear comfortable,2
this was awful dont waste your money i would give it zero if possible,0
charms are larger than they appear,1
this whale pattern clearly goes one direction and the entire hat has the whales upside down,0
too small to fit on the average womans legs the stretchy bits work but the lace at the top cuts the circulation out of my legs,0
too small,0
this is a nice watch from afar when you look up close you can see it is poorly made i have worn it for about 2 weeks now and it is already falling apart today the band came off and i had to hot glue it together i am not impressed i liked the color and was excited to receive this watch but it has disappointed me i would suggest spending more money on a watch that will hold up,1
poor quality zipper broke while zipping up colors not as depicted,0
very cute but tight and difficult to get on i would need at least one size larger than the regular classic uggs that i buy,1
these did the job for halloween and ill be wearing them as a costume again im sure my complaints are that the material is like a swimsuit which i found to be uncomfortable but kind of works for the mermaid look and these leggings definitely run small,2
much smaller than i expected too small for the 610 year olds at birthday party but they are cute seemed decent quality for price,1
used for random bracelets watches ill be purchasing another one soon,2
i am so sad i really wanted these pajama pants to work out they are literally falling apart at the seams and that is after wearing them only three times these pajamas are soft and great but if they fall apart they are definitely not worth the money,0
ordered for my grandson it is snug on him and also on my husband they are both 6 foot tall and around 230 lbs,1
i was recently diagnosed with ms and ive been trying to use any and every natural remedy i can find to ease the muscle and nerve pain the bracelet doesnt help with that but the knuckles in my hands have gotten smaller and i dont have arthritis pain at all i also bought one for my grandmother and she loves it,2
i bought this top for christmas photo shoot it really disappoint me bcoz the materisl is not good and size is too tight it looks like medium so iam going to returnbr the lenght of the top too short so dont waste your money,0
does not fit my glasses might be ok if it did all these solar shield clipon lenses appear only to fir smaller frames sizing guidance at the site are not useful in selecting lens,0
this did not fit welltoo tight uncomfortable for me so had to return itbr cute design for right person but not for me,1
sorry,1
i really wanted to like this shirt but it was too small,1
definitely not an xl,0
material is thin and sewing is bad tried to return but too busy to do it,0
fabric is nylon and not thick like a normal sweatshirt this is basically a overly large fitting long sleeved shirt kinda odd fitting but ill keep since it was so inexpensive,0
these are ok however the sizing is small compared to other jms products that i have purchased,1
was a gift fro granddaughter,2
ordered another pair because theyre so comfortable great quality,2
it made my costume,2
runs a bit small buy a larger size than you think you would wear quality of the fabric is decent,1
the quality of the material was very poor for the price of the hat,0
very thin cute but super thin,1
liked the raincoat definitely not all season very lightweight,1
cute but smaller than expected quality is that as youd find in a 99c store and not as pictured or worth 800 i needed a tortoise shell look earring so ill keep and wear them until i find a larger pair of better quality,0
bought for friend he loved it,2
these bras are not high impact i think they might work for yoga but i wouldnt know i got them for a friend they offer no support for high impact activities,1
one shoe fits one doesnt have worn vibrant shoes for years bought a size larger than my size re comments that they run small big hassle to return love vibrams but this type not right ugh,0
love this top will be ordering more in fun colors sized true soft fabric,2
i like the style it was the wrong size,2
these are not the most supportive slippers on the market they are very cushy and they keep my feet warm i have had better slippers but never at this price the combination of great price and good performance make this slipper a great investment not sure how they will hold up but at this price i do not mind frequently replacing them if need be,2
very beautiful only reason i didnt rate 5 stars was because its slightly bigger than i was hoping well worth the money though great value and super prettybr br edit do not buy each of the studs fell out over a couple of weeks time they fell in my ear and i had to dig them out very disappointed,0
very impressed my pair arrived in nice packaging and feel really sturdy wasnt expecting this quality of item given the price also surprised by the extra nose pads and screwdriver thats included will surely use joopin again,2
way too small for being a large no ball room,0
even if you bought these two sizes large they would not fit right the binding around the lowest part is ridiculously right no stretch dont waste your money,0
the best,2
the cap arrived way before i expected the craftsmanship is great the materail looks to be of good quality the color is spoton as in the picture but the hat is a little large i can fix this with hat sizing tape but my real grievance isthe cap is just too baggy lookingtoo floppy it doesnt have or hold an attractive shape in that respect it doesnt quite look like the pictires ultimately im a bit disappointed with it,1
i love these i have already purchased more i used to buy all of my tanks at target but these are even better i like them for layering i am 56 118lbs and the xs fits perfect,2
wish it was a pair of arrows but cute,2
very nice product the color they call gravel is actually very dark green was hoping it would be dark grey at least you absolutely must order a size larger on the waist i wear a 36 and got the 38w and they fit perfectly,2
this dress is nothing like the picturebr it is not sized properlybr it looks like an arts and craft project gone badbr its too bad i missed the deadline for returnbr what was meant to be a communion dress now has to be a hollowing play dress,0
this is meant for a bigger person its too big and it pulls my arm hair but it is pretty,1
i really like the bracelet but it comes aliose very easliy,0
i love theseive had them before and whenever i need another pair i contact you guys thanks so much thanks,2
very cheap looking some of the stones were out not good,0
broke quickly in two months,0
no clothes,0
i was not a fan of this dress if you have a little extra chunk this isnt for you i bought the large for my 52 155 lb self and it was not flattering it made my love handles look even larger than they are and the sleeves were too long the material is thick it appears to be good quality but i didnt examine it closelybr br i think the dress would be great for someone skinny and tall i am neither i returned the dress,1
this are wonderful winter boots the color soft suede furry top are a beautiful combination your feet will stay warm and dry with the aquatalia waterproof feature,2
very poorly made broke after using a handful of times,0
really them then i was just hoping they werent so thin my kiddo will rip this in a day or two,1
i cant say whether or not the rfid blocking feature works thank goodness but this is a nice simple good quality wallet at a good price its not too big and bulky but i can fit my checkbook cash and all of my cards in it it also came with a nice little walletsized picture holder i wasnt able to fit it in the wallet although i suspect i could have if i left out my checkbook,2
its a nice necklace but the cross does not stay in the infinity part it comes apart and can fall off your neck,0
its cute but the ear fell off after 1 use so be prepared to sew it back on,1
not expensive as others looks great on bright blue color that is popular,2
this worked well enough for what i needed it for the back was low enough that i didnt need to use straps id purchased to make bras lower the v was deep enough that it didnt show i like that i was able to adjust it to a halter and i feel that that gave it a little extra support i definitely would suggest using some fashion tape to keep it a bit more secure though the way it is cut and the way the material is it isnt super supportive it really did work well enough though i was able to get it in in time and it was significantly better than any stick on 34bras34 out there i had gotten the 34b fit and i cant imagine another size would have worked better so i was pleased with the fit,1
when i bought these they where 12 bucks acceptable at that price but i wouldnt pay morebr these are pretty much disposable,1
the zipper broke in less then a month i bought it back in march 21 2021 and broke may 5 2021 cheap zipper,0
super difficult to put on i actually started bleeding from attempting to put it on i think it stretched my piercing because i had to adjust the way the bar went in and for it to latch onto the other side,0
ill sized the tops was a lot larger than the bottom i had to return it sure was pretty though i had difficulty opening the frogs up the front as well knots and loops,0
yeah a 14 inch of padding if you prefer unlined cups as i do this makeda spacer bra will make your chest look ridiculously rounded and overstuffed as it did on me furthermore there is no elastic on the upper edge of the cups so they gape away from the body when bending over just awful especially since anita is known for elasticizing the tops of their bra cups and shying away from any sort of padding see the anita rosa faia aurelia allover lace underwire bra 5672 the band however fits perfectly to size a 40 e is a 40e,0
i had recent cataract surgery that left my eyes sensitive to uv and these things took care of it and continue to do so as these are the darkest clipons ive ever found glad i bought more because apparently they are out of or dont carry the dark ones,2
its a shame because the ring is so pretty but it broke in a couple of weeks the bottom part broke off the post at least it wasnt terribly expensive do not recommend,0
this bag is very flimsy just putting my phone makes it sagneeds to be more sturdy,1
had to return as the fabric was super thin clingy and just not yet quality i wanted i have two similar dresses i purchased off of amazon probably 7 years ago and they are made so much better i still wear them and am sad the manufacturer no longer carries them this dressjust did not meet expectations,0
bought this for my teen daughter its a bit long on her frame but she finds it very comfortable,2
i like the color and material but this tank was way too short for me im 3 months postpartum and this is just not working for me this will be an at home workout top only,1
like the jacket only issue is the torso is short and the sleeves are long my gut hangs and this thing was not gut friendly even in a nice 5xl an extra 2 on the torso and 2 less on the sleeve and it would be perfect,1
kinda cheap looking but i wasnt expecting much at that price its okay,1
size was a little large but as i walked around in them i guess i will have to keep them maybe heavy socks will help nice and warm and look great,2
the slippers were nice and warm but the traction beads on the bottom started falling off right away i had it for a day and a third of them had fallen offi basically wore it around the house just sitting so i didnt do any highlevel activity with it on the slippers were nice and soft but im afraid i would eventually slip and fall in a matter of days at the rate the traction beads were coming offreturned,0
this dress was cute but runs very very small had to return,1
i wanted to love this dress the print was nice and it seemed casual but classy but sadly it was way to sheer see through itd be good as a beach wrap for reference i ordered the dress in white,1
way too small for my 64 230lb frame too tight across the midsection and under the arms,0
purchased for our 15 mo toddler who is now 17months these dont hold up when compared to a less expensive simple rubber soled mesh shoe from a unpopular brand for toddlers we wanted to love these however they get dirty fast and scuff easily on the toe because of the material theyre stiffer than other shoes and not as light weight thats not good for little ones when worn our toddler has a slower and heavier walk and his gait changes for the worse not a good buy for toddlers just walking just cute to look at we purchased a less expensive rubber soled mesh shoe and had better results,1
im small chested like a cup small i got the mediums they fit nicely in the cup but snug around the chestbr br i didnt realize they were hand wash so that sucks i put them in the hand wash cycle on my machine and everything was fine my husband washed them the second time and not knowingly put them in the regular color cycle they came out fine but one of the pads got all wadded up at the top i wish the pads were just sewn in place theyre a pain to straighten outbr br overall they are fine my post baby boobs fill the medium but if i wear a night pad in the bra and it can be a tight fit come the morning when i need to pump or feedbr br ill just have to be more careful washing them in the hand wash cycle i may end up taking out the pads,2
this belt is everything the manufacturer said it is an attractive rich dark brown the leather and it is definitely real leather with a great leather aroma and feel is thick enough to wear well and supple enough to conform to your bodys curves comfortably the width of the belt slides easily though the loops on my jeans the buckle is a simple classic design and is made from real brassbr br there is a hole punch included along with instructions on how to shorten it if needed the belt arrives in an attractive substantial box making this an excellent choice for gift giving,2
the dress is thin material and gapes on the sides i got a medium im 57 and 135 and the length is great but the sides are bad ill have to sew it to fix overall its not bad for a cheap dress but you get what you pay for,1
this watch looks nice it feels nice all metalbr br and it absolutely doesnt work every other digital watch ive ever bought in the past forty years has worked out of the box not this one i opened it up thinking that there was a plastic insert preventing the battery from making a connection nope just flat out brokenbr br and worse once i got the tiny ittybitty minuscule screws out of the back plate i could not get them back in no need to really because the stupid pos doesnt workbr br finally because i got this through vine i have to pay for this even though its broken bogus,0
love the dress it fits as expected material is of good quality,2
dont fit like the real oakley lens cant see out of them everything looks like a rainbow,0
i purchased this tank 4pk based on other reviews im not sure if these gals were guessing their heightweight but im 55 105lbs 34a really slim several reviewers claimed to be this sizeshape and they stated the small there is no xs was a nice comfy tight fit a couple reviewers even said theyd go up a size uh these shirts are not for slender gals theyre huge if youre looking for fitted or semifitted no if youre looking for a tank to wear to bed dont mind swimming in it while exposing all your goodies then yes this is for you me ill just stick wprana for yoga wear,0
i hope you love ironing this is made of that soft fabric that is wrinkled coming out of the dryer even if you are standing there waiting great color but not likely to make high rotation this darth vader cape is high maintenance,1
a gift loved it,2
,0
too small for my taste but it is made well,1
these are cute but not as soft or quality material as usual disney brand pajamas i think theyre worth half the price,1
these are super cute bracelets but they will not stay tight on her wrist and will fall off,1
i was not expecting great quality however this looks very very cheap i wont be wearing it,0
for less than ten bucks i bought three of these great shirt,2
i bought this for my four year old as he wanted one after he saw his 10 year old brother had one it is easy to set and he loves the flashing lights,2
the material of the luggage is very thin it feels very flimsy compared to other luggage in this price category i used it on a road trip from california to texas and the outside plastic started peeling if your looking for something affordable look at another option this one is only a matter of time until i break it and it is a disappointment,0
funny arrived fast very happy good fit,2
i would love to go braless and thought i would give these a try i give them a 2 because the adhesive is not sticky enough to hold i am constantly pressing down on then to keep them in place however i will continue to use them around the house just to conceal my nipples i would not purchase these if you are a d cup and need lift,0
i hope the wedding party is not wearing the same color,2
not strong enough,1
was very thin and way too short and i got a small and im 53 so im pretty short for it to be too short on me sleeves were also a bit short,0
the design is very flattering being somewhat apple shaped this dress enhances the top half while hiding the middle below beautifully flowing material the wrinkles from packaging ironed out easily the material feels soft and is only a little see through purchased the predominantly black design and also the cream and love them both equallybr im a 36c and typically wear a size 12 or large and they both fit very comfortably not tight and no gaping at the buttons,2
no exaggeration when reviews a say this runs small this runs way small feels like a girls size it wore like a bandeau crop top not what is pictured at all,0
i ordered my 3yr old son going on 4 a size 34 it was entirely too big i ordered a smaller size 23 its still pretty big my son is average size he wears 3t4t id say size down if youre getting the distressed jean jacket,0
cant be reviewedi will buy no more items without them being prime,0
my boyfriend got this just too great to pass up outfit for the brigerton queens ball a netflix experience and although its the perfect costume for the occasion it was just one disaster after anotherbr br now dont get me wrong if you have some time to prepare this costume set could be a really great value but if you want something easy and readytowear you just wont be wearing it longbr it needs major repair before wearbr br i was so proud of finding this costume for him but now i feel terrible that i couldnt find betterbr we got a lot of compliments at the queens ball and he really looked fantastic and authentic when we walked in which is why i just couldnt give it less than 3 stars but this outfit is sooo cheaplypoorly constructed that its good for one night at most andor needs some major tlcrepair befooore wearing which is ridiculous for something brand new after about 45 minutes not even an hour wearing it my boyfriend had already lost 2 vest buttons and 1 shirt button he had already replaced the pants im sorry but i dont know any man whos going to be comfortable in the tight highwaisted satin pants it came with we had a little trouble buttoning his left shirt cuff since they forgot to give that button a buttonhole the included ascot tie is awfully short to tie properlybr by the end of the ball my boyfriend didnt have much left of the original costume in tact anyways his vest was falling off it couldnt stay in place without all its buttons and half were gone his shirt lost a button wouldnt stay closed or flat either hed already replaced the pants and he had to buy another tie the jacket was literally the only piece of the set to make it to the end of the nightbr br i think that this set couldn be saved with a little care just make sure to apply that care before wearing or youll be carerying it homebr if you take the time to thoroughly examine every piece for defects like my boyfriends missing buttonhole and restitch all the buttons on tightly replace the pants and add some inexpensive simple accessories and youll get a great value out of this setbr if you dont sew dont buy this setbr not sure why anyone would buy from this seller for 107 anymore anyways when you can get it for 99 as a prime item now then at least you can easily return it if it has defective piecesbr br note as they add more color options they seem to be addressing some of the issues with this costume set like the satin pants the red and blue coat sets come with cotton pants i would give it another few months for them to get it right before considering purchasebr best of luck youre going to need it,1
they are a little to low for my preference good quality though,1
within a week the shoes leaked we live in northwest washington its wet here even a cheap pair of shoes should hold up better than this,0
ordered for my 1 year old and they were too small returning cute shoes though,1
my 8yr old grandson likes it designstyle attractive flimsycheap,1
love the stretch watch band looks great with the apple watchbr shipping was fast,2
the idea to my mind for a belt from a purely pragmatic standpoint is to make sure your trousers dont creep slowly down your backside and ultimately prevent you from showing your undergarments to passersby much like any belt that aim is achieved through the currently en vogue ratchet system its primary duty however is hampered by the sheer heft of the buckle in the picture a minimal reproduction of the traditional strap and buckle in reality a massive texassized contraption of mechanical might it would in the near future dystopian world we may live in be a very functional and durable weapon and is probably better suited to bludgeoning rather than pantsholderupping,0
unfortunately the fit is small but its a beautiful shirt,1
cheap materialnot flatteringlooks to be lingerie,0
cute but i could only wear it once very poor quality i dont think this is a real max studio outfit due to its quality,0
these are amazing so adorable and soft and very well made i love love these so much i am going to buy myself more i already know one thing my family members will be getting for christmas next year a pair for everyone there are so many to choose from buy buy buy,2
these are very nice they are thicker than expected warm and cozy they look better in person,2
fits great and very soft material my nephew loves em,2
it fit as expected and the color is beautiful,1
poor quality,0
quality of these sox has gone down over past couple of years pretty thin,1
there was a fairly deep dentscratch right in the middle of one of the sides of the pendant i have to make sure to try and wear it so that that side is hidden otherwise its a good necklace,1
this watch left me throbbing with delight and its heavy enough to beat someone with not that id risk getting hair and scalp wedged under the diamond encrusted bezel its always such a bitch to scrape off youd think for 200000 it would be self cleaning and also have some kind of pleasureyou mode too winkwink br orbr maybe the problem is that youd think thatbr irregardless the instant i bought this watch every problem in my life was resolved so 3 out of 5 stars,1
the seamstitching on the crotch sux its not even aligned no matter how i tried to twist the waist a little here or therebr then the label ua underarmour insignia on the leg also started coming offbr its one of those buys that i shouldve known better not to ever buy leggings onlinebr br i would love to return it but i tore off the tags already as i always do habit and i was too excited cause of the pockets br br save your money dont buy this spend your hard earned money on something else,0
my son love those light up sneakers fix perfectly well recommended,2
very comfortable but as a larger woman my breasts end up as a uniboob there is no shaping to the breast but it is comfortable so i use it for around the house bra and use my wacoal bras when out in public,1
great volleyball shoes for a year or so as with most court shoes wearing them outside very quickly wears down the rubber traction and ive had mine for three years now and they are starting to stretch out but tying the laces really tight every half hour or so normally works,1
these frames help keep your mask off your nose and mouth directly but do get moist and need to be removed and cleaned to be comfortable when wearing masks for a long time they help not feeling smothered,1
had higher hopes for this dress ended up returning imo it is not worth the price did not like the material almost reminded me of like a trash bag or wind breaker size guide was accurate but it was not at all flattering on me large bust small waist large hips,1
true to size comfortable well made held my 45 all day with no problem highly recommend,2
does not do custom fingerprint or namebr also does not return amazons messages for reruns buyer beware,0
wore it as a workout top but will also wear for casual weekends fits perfect and the quality of fabric is better than expected,2
small,1
this is about what i expected it certainly isnt a quality piece the garnet colored center piece is essentially plastic my 14yearold son thinks its great though i feel i paid too much for this,0
a little bit large and see through,1
stretch come lose at the bottom,2
nice compressions socks i wear them all day at work and they are very helpful with edema,2
love the color and thinking of another onedifferent color wish there was size option as my wrist is small but not a big deal love the look,2
it was fine until it was not first one broke i expect the second one to follow the issues is the spring in the buckle it is gone i am losing weight so a spontaneous belt failure while out is an issue kingmoore never more,0
the colors of these socks are great and the fabric is soft very comfortable and great quality,2
4s are usually a little big on me and these are way too small order up a size or youll be disappointed too they are cute but cute is no good if you cant wear them because you cant squeeze your foot into them,0
review 010119br br i have only used this a handful of times and the interior fabric straps have already ripped,1
returned did not even come to my waist much less dress length not sure what happened with this one have purchased same style previously and it was nice,0
i loved the style color and fit of the dress what i didnt like was the dress was super thin,0
im 52 175lbs short thicker in the bottom part of my body ordered a medium based on the reviews they arent as form fitting as i was expecting extremely long returning for a size small will update the review once they arrive but overall the quality of these is amazing super cute light weight so perfect for spring summer the length was the only thing that killed it for me,1
the straps are a little narrow so they do slip off sometimesget twisted but the backpack is surprisingly roomy and seems pretty sturdy the vinyl doesnt seem like it will crack and have sharp edges or start peeling etc and the zippers havent stuck on me yet i bought a shirt and a pair of knee socks at a concert and still had room for my wallet phone small makeup bag glasses case etc and the shirt my friend bought as well,2
this bracelet is beautiful i got the blue and it is mainly opalite beads and another stone that im not sure about its not moonstone it has a bit of a greenish huebr br the cord is soft and nothing pinches or pulls hairs the cord has several knots so you pick the right size for your wrist and then cut off the excess,2
loved the colors on this purse which is why i ordered but its quite a bit larger than i like this causes me to load it down with 34stuff34 making it heavy then items im looking for get lost would be nice if it had more compartments to organize contents cell phone compartment isnt large enough for my samsung galaxy 8 it falls out every time i try it has only one zippered compartment on inside and 2 small pockets that arent deep enough to hold hardly anything,1
very soft and cuddly my granddaughter loves them they also washed up very well,0
a little big otherwise ok,1
tops are cute but really short then again im a bit endowed so i cant really complain theyre very thin for a workout tank i have to wear this tank over another one to make sure nothingsurprising pops out,1
i hate it its like pulling masking tape tape of your breast its hurts so bad when you have to take them off not worth the money and much less the pain,0
its really comfortable and way cute on but after you dry it it looks cheap and not as cute,1
i was able to get the bottom one done correctly but that was only after i messed up the top one the issue with this is the pictures in the instructions are very blurry so you cant tell which way youre supposed to face the adhesive before putting it on your teeth which is how i realized i messed up the first time and now i cant use it anymore,0
its spider web thin,0
completely see thru,0
they fit perfect and are very supple but still durable my husband loved them very dressy but still masculine the snaps are easy to do up and undo,2
my son loves them,2
love this dress not only is it pretty but super comfortable as well received lots of compliments on it and they couldnt believe the price i paid for it wore mine with cowboy boots but the dress also looks nice with a heel or wedge sandal i liked it so much i ordered another love that it has pockets too,2
headliner not sewn in well hat itself is good quality,1
little big but comfortable,2
had to send back because product was way too large,1
the hue pajama pants i received were shorter than advertised mine came with a 27 inseam rather than a 295 inseam fyi the colors are stronger than they appear in the photo the fabric feels nice ive ordered from hue many times and generally been very pleased however since the pandemic began this is the second time i have had a pant not fit as expected another pair was cut and sewn very shallow in the tush area and the backside was more than 2 lower than other pairs ordered when sitting the pant stopped just at the crevice so you may want to try before buy i would still buy from hue because their cotton rayon pants are comfy for lounging and bed,1
cute but one of them came damaged they feel strong and sturdy which is a good thing but wont be wearing them damaged,1
i purchased this jersey for myself and absolutely loved it its a great buy for the price its lightweight and of pretty good quality it comes with the mlb tag,2
these sunglasses are truly polarized they look good and theyre quick to put on in the car they do their job well,2
these pocket squares look nice but they are small supposed to be 10 x 10 inches but are just under 10 inches square as shown in the picturesbr br they are decent enough pocket squares they feel a touch thinner than my other pocket square but still feel sturdy but folding into more elaborate folds might be difficult due to the small size also they might slip into the pocket for the same reason however if you use a pocket square holder and you dont use elaborate folds then these should work out fine,0
this is an adorable sweater but light weight enough to wear this summer youll want to consider ordering a size smaller for your child its long but that would make it cute worn as a dress with a pair of leggings or tights its really well made and a very pretty shade of pink i love the style and would make a great addition to any childs wardrobe,2
the fit was true to size and the colors were nice however i wish the inner padding was better quality they do not offer as much support as i had hoped,1
glove was too small,1
purchased this quartz keychain less than three months ago and just realized today the quartz crystal is missing the silver chain remains but the crystal fell off and is nowhere to be found very disappointed poor quality would not recommend,0
i ordered size 23 years and received an outfit that is smaller than my sons old twelve month clothes this was supposed to be a gift for a friends daughter for her birthday we live out of town so now i either have to risk driving in an ice storm or show up with nothing actually i guess well probably just not go so thank you for thatbr also super cheap looking on top of probably being too small for an infant,0
very cheap not even the ones on the picture waste of money,0
i was excited about this top the first thing i noticed is that the color is more of a cornflower blue not a deep blue the second was the quality of material which is thin and cheap the forearms are proportionally small the thumb holes are in the wrong place all in all a complete miss,0
awful not gold color one came damaged cant use due to wrong color returning,0
im giving these 5 stars for the fit and pockets material is great and they are very comfortablebr the only downside is my wife wont actually let me wear them to the gym inappropriate was the term she used so they are great lounging around shorts,2
fell apart after wearing a few times the string broke week 1 and now the strap to tighten is also missing cute but not worth the money,0
we pack this thing full of stuff for swimming but the handles pop off easily which is really irritating then you have to find the inner circle piece that came off its easy to clean and less expensive than similar bags,1
not like any smartwool product ive had before these are really itchy and the inseam must be 32 at a minimum going back,1
soft to touch very nice fabric,2
like the style but bought several sizing off on this one,1
exactly what i was looking for quality material and not flimsy,2
i like the watch and the looks the problem so far has been that the time the watch set is wrong and im working on getting it rightit would be nice to have a simple way to set time and date i could worry about what time it is in rio later,1
i got the mesh version of the hat and as a couple others have mentioned the top front of the hat is very pointy looking it looks fairly dumb aside from that the rest of the hat is decent,0
pros the quality of the fabric and the way it fits is greatbr cons the print looks nothing like the picture am very disappointed as the print i received isnt as nice i may order another one in a print i like and pray it looks the same as whats advertisedbr however i will keep it due to how it fits and feels,1
really cute but a little small,2
perfect i love it,2
had order a half size larger wish i could send them back probably cant since i wore them to work a couple of times insoles are super hard and uncomfortablebr update ive owned these shoes for 3 months and the soles are falling off paid 120 and now they are junk now i see them on here 30 cheaper changing my review to one star because zero is not an option,0
it fits wellbr color of leather is greatbr lock changed color after couple of normal use,1
the earrings came completely broken no post at all i guess you get what you pay for junk,0
the sleeves on this sweatshirt are more like tee shirt materialvery thin,1
i loved my first pair of hokas and they are still going strong after 18 months of wear i talked up hokas arch support and how they made my hip stop hurting so i ordered this pair but one of the eyelets pulled out after 4 months i was so upset and disappointed ridiculous for these shoes to be far inferior to my costco gardening shoes has success gone to the heads of hoka designers i doubt i will buy another pair unless i buy from a local shoe store that stands by their products,0
i was dubious of amazon clothes but the allegra k line does fit a bit on the large side which is a good thing my shirts have gotten compliments,2
nice color and good material the only con was the sewn in place bra the pads were awkwardly high on the chest,2
upon trying to put this on the strap broke i had to sew several places just to reinforce seams strap connections etc,0
it doesnt really whisk away sweat but its underwear i have had way better,1
the material is really soft and i liked that but i ordered it in white and it was very see through,0
made in china really small,0
4x shirt fit like an american 2x way undersized disappointing since the material was so beautiful and the shirt well made returned for a hasslefree refund,0
basic watch i bought a similar one and got i dont know at least a year from the band getting a new watch is cheaper than getting a new band im happy with it,2
gift to my brother hes size 718 cap this cap is nice except its too big for heads slightly towards the lower end of the measurement range an adjustment snap or velcro strip adjustment wud make it perfect a strong wind will blow it off your head,1
smaller than expected smallest chain ever,1
im not happy im an 80 year old female and have worn new balance mens shoes for more than 20 years the only shoes ive worn shoe quality has lessened as time passed the toe box on this shoe is rounded rather than tapered as it appears in the photos amazon you know people use the reviews to help decide on a purchase the leading reviews are not current 2018 was 4 years ago 2017 five worst of all 99 sneakers and all return choices no longer include printing a label and dropping off at ups store,1
i order this for easter and one was broke very hard to close but the kids love the design,1
was looking for sun protection and after reading another review i bought this scarf is perfect,2
fits a bit small but works,2
i returned this because i ordered much bigger than normal and its very tight across the chest its also a very thin material i was expecting thicker and higher quality,0
bought the xl for my 15 month old grandson and it was nearly impossible to get them over his chubby little thighs he was 28 lbs great quality and nice concept but poor fit we use them twice before packing them off in a donation box,0
not just for men anymore i was looking for a pair of sweat pantstop to lounge in most clothing like this for women is either 34form fitting34 which is not comfortable for lounging or is way too expensive this sweater is great even if its suppose to be for men i purchased a size small and it is a perfect combination of comfortable without looking sloppy this is my 3rd one,2
i love these feels great,2
so i bought 2 of these black and brown they come nicely packaged and look really good they work well until they dont one had the ratchet buckle fall apart completely the other is functioning well still not sure if i would recommend though,1
the neck ripped after one use,0
its not like the other asics shoes its a bit narrower and has no arch support i wear it for looks not comfort,1
the fabric and look of this shirt was very nice but a medium was a bit too tight on me am planning to return it soon,1
great product and value,2
tried to fit the perfect length but these pants were a little too long,1
the heel lip on one of the shoes folded in,1
tarnished with in wearing twice got tangled easily was very disappointed,0
i loved my first pair of these and am so glad they still make them i like the tan distressed look for wearing with khakis,2
wish i got the one with the makeup brush holders but otherwise it works,1
inexpensive probr looks cheap von,1
this fabric feels like a 15 halloween costume i was shocked at the lack of quality for the price i paid the fit was also no good the waist sits at a weird spot on the body and there was a lot of room in the bust despite my 32d cup returned,1
cute flannel but runs way too small i ordered the 2x which i thought would be a little big but fine im about size 14 38d what arrived is a chinese 6x and too tight even tight on my forearms which are not an unusual size i can wear it with one button done over my stomach and a t underneath but my chest doesnt really fit going to try with a smooshy sports bra,0
what a beautiful bag couldnt be any happier with my purchase,2
great boot,2
the sleeves are pretty short and sizes run smalltheres also no tag to tell you which is the front and which is the back,0
the fabric is so weak that the cut out parts pieces of fabric in the eyes teeth came apart,0
looks cool at 10ft or more away looks bad up closebr edges are sharp fyi they say you can wear it but i would not recommend itbr it will not fit anyone with a large hat size way to small to wear anything under itbr will look okay sitting on a shelf for deco in a kids roombr totally not recommended for wear due to the edges,0
it was flimsy wouldnt stand up very disappointed,0
i loved this skirt it was just too small i would have kept it im finally losing weight but i havent had that size waist since my 30s size chart does show that it runs small but i forgot to check,2
color is a bit brighter than anticipated and not as soft as expected it is an unremarkable shirt,0
the item is not true to size my husband is a 34 and we still ordered a size up and it came too small,0
fit perfectly i especially like the feel of the tshirts,2
didnt look the same and xl looked like a small returned,2
let me start by saying how smooth and lightweight these necklaces are just crafted to literal perfection the color and shine is gorgeous they are easily put on and look great with just about anything i have ordered from countless of buyers and this one just stands out from them all order it i will promise you that you wont regret it i would definitely want to order more pieces from this buyer shipping was on time and for the price you just cant beat im obsessed and a customer to stay,2
it was too big it wouldnt stay on any wrist i know of only useful as carrying,0
for the men who do not like the george costanza wallet this probably ideal,2
bought two pairs one was broken as soon as i opened bag very cute bite poorly made,0
at first you think these are tight once you wear a few times they break in and fit true to size,2
did not like the material its a bit itchy my arms broke out wouldnt recommend this brand ill have to keep looking around,0
very nice item more sparkly in real life than in the picture wellmade excellent price shipped very quickly i definitely recommend the item and the seller,2
i was hesitant about buying underwear online but needed underwear that would line dry quickly while traveling i highly recommend them,2
they are a cute show but the soles are narrow and flat so your feet start to hurt after awhile,1
these are super dark and almost opaque if worn for more than 8 hours you may lose circulation in your leg,0
cute but very tiny and not a great quality i like the idea behind the style but it was very short in the torso tight in the bust and the shiny 34scales34 were slightly rubbed away,0
too fit like a cropbr top too small,0
love the fabric with theses board shorts however i didnt expect to have to order such a huge size difference i read the reviews so i ordered a xl i wear a size 12 when i got them i tried them on and they were skin tight returned them no problem there and ordered a xxl they fit perfectly so warning to all on the size you may want to order 23 sizes larger,0
we like walls quality living on a farm every bit of clothing ends up being dragged into the farming process at some time or another and only really good quality stuff stands the hard use this shirt is nice enough to go out to dinner yet it would be comfortable on a tractor as well if the tag says walls we know it will wash well and look good over time,2
band was super cute and i loved the color however one end was messed up and wouldnt slide into my watch face i was really impressed with the quality but i obviously couldnt use it so i sent it back,0
i bought these to use to from and in an indoor pool and they are fine for that they are not heavyduty enough to be called hiking sandals,1
perfect size and length love it,2
this is an attractive sports bra at a great price which is hard to find for larger breasts but i am not sure i would say it 34supports34 it pretty much smooshes them down which while effective is not exactly what i had in mindbr br that being said it is pretty much what i expected for the price i will not be returning it but i dont think i would purchase more,1
bends easier than other bioplast jewelry ive had but overall works as intended,1
these shoes would have been perfect for me love the heel height and the wonderful leather i have a wide foot these were so wide my foot went clear to the front and kept flipping off the back of my foot i am so disappointed i really need a shoe like this but they are either too narrow or too wide grrrr,0
comfy and love the pockets first one i bought was different color and amazon suggested small for me but it was a little tight around the breast area i am 36 dd so this time around i purchased medium and it fit perfectly,2
very cute but ran small in the chest area even though i fell within their measurements givenfit perfect everywhere else sadly had to return,1
very cute and seasonalcould be larger,1
typical piece if chinese crap,0
sent product quickly and is what was advertised,2
very nice,2
make sure to read the dimensions very well bigger size might have been better not enough space for multiple phones,1
please do not ask me to revise my reviewbr i will not do so i was trying to get this as a christmas gift 4 someone i am so disgusted by what i recieved and delivered today this was definitely not worth 2100 if i wanted to get scammed i simply couldve gone to a real harley davidson store 2 check items out in person please dont waste ur money buying thisbr this is a disappointment to give this to a person as a giftthis is ashame,0
i love that socks look exactly as displayed and have been a great alternative to my black compression socks,2
the earrings and necklace turned colors after 1 time wearing it,0
these look nice in and i think theyre made out of a good quality metal as i have sensitive ears and have been wearing them for about a week now with no issues my only complain is that one pair in particular was extremely hard to open and close but i fixed it with a pair of wire cutters,2
this blouse is very pretty but it fits very oddly im a tall woman and have a problem with tops being too short but this one is wide and short,1
casual every day bag practical and stylish,2
purchased this bag in blue and immediately noticed it was not 22 inches as stated i purchased it to place a travel toddler bed and this will not work due to the seller listing incorrect measurements as shown in my picture the bag from bottom seam to top is 20 inches in addition the bag will not stay closed the little black clip on the bag just lets the cording slip through so anything in the bag will just fall out i figured these issues may have been a fluke so i ordered another bag in blue same problemwrong size at 20 inches tall and bag will not drawstring close in terms of quality of bag its unremarkable i would avoid,0
followed the size chart but way too small returned,0
really cute but the neck was too big,1
its made really well just way too big i got the smallest one,1
,0
didnt work sent it back,0
first review rejected lets try thisbr br i enjoy getting damaged items that were clearly returns with holes cut in two places from someones box cutter and then crammed into a rumpled mess and shipped to me damaged returns is just what i wanted and expected when i paid for a new ponchobr br thank you for a wonderful purchase,0
these work out shirts arebr comfortable during work out fit wellbr br im 58 170 medium was perfectbr br i purchased them for use with peloton home gym use you dont even know your wearing a shirtbr br my 24 yo liked them we bought set forbr him as well,2
i hate that no company makes an opaque white shirt i feel a dress shirt would look dressier if you couldnt see a pitted out undershirt through it but it the style of this shirt seems par for the course as to what the general market offers its fine,1
these came in so handy to hang things in my rats cages easy to maneuver and not too heavy very sturdy,2
this hat is super warm and the ponytail hole is great i work as paramedic so i need to wear my head up and out of the way and im outside in the elements this is the best of both worlds,2
flimsy fake pockets material was seethrough,0
the red was to much so i returned them but i didnt like the way they fit and are comfort,1
love this dress fit great looked good,2
perfect wallet holds so much,2
i got this dress and took it out of the package part of the package was stuck to the dress it wont come off no matter the method so sad because it looked and fit great,1
i ended up returning these they are very transparent,1
it scratches your credit cards and if youre like me with polished long nails it is guaranteed to break your nails it is strong it is def durable but hard to insert what you need there,1
one of the eyes fell off before it could even be worn,0
so this isnt nearly as cute and sparkly as i expected looks kind of dingy compared to my other silver rings i wear a size 9 and ordered a size 9 but its quite a bit tighter than my other rings its ok not bad definitely not great,1
to small xl id maybe a medium its getting old buying things that are marked incorrectly had to return,1
small,1
the fit was as expected but the material was more seethrough than expected im a mom of a curious boy so i wanted something more conservative if it were just my husband and me at home it would be fine but i am returning because it is too sheer for my needs,1
these glasses are too big for my face they do not rest on the bridge of my nose sometimes a problem i have because of face shape will use at home but not in public or on zoom,1
i purchased this shirt in large and it was too short and a bit snug like a fitted shirt so i got another in xl and its way too big in every way im 57 175 lbs dad bod these shirts are nice but dont have a chest pocket,1
love these flat platform wedges they are perfect for dressing up or down and are very easy to walk in the only reason i am not giving them five stars is that there is a little extra leather around the ankle but nothing i cant live with,2
this fit was very large i ordered a large because im a us size 12 top 36ddd and this fit was too large for me if it had adjustable straps i might have kept it but there was no way to make it work because it wasnt adjustable it also looked and felt more like a swimming suit top rather than a bralette or sports bra,0
i wear this easy summer dress often,2
i wanted to love these boots but they lack some fairly standard traits a hiking boot should have ill start off by saying they are pretty comfortable out of the box and have a footbed thats kinda makes you feel like you are being propelled forward when walking they are very light weight and have a very nice appearance i love the way they look first ding was the laces they are super thin and dont feel like they will hold up next was the toe box its too big for my feet so they were sliding around a bit when i was hiking i have standard width feet i didnt get any blisters though on an 11 mile break in hike next big issue is the traction on rocks i dont know what rubber they use but its just not up to snuff i was doing a lot of rock scrambles and they did not feel confidence inspiring i think they should make a deal and get one of the better rubber manufacturers to help them out i love stealth rubber for stickiness and vibram for durability lastly was the construction of the boot they do have a nice rubberized coating on the lower part of the boot but the upper materials dont feel very tough the upper part by the heel is like neoprene and the lower mesh is sod to the touch im not sure how theyd hold up to abrasions from rocks id bet money that they will shred a wear quickly this boot could be fixed i hope on learns from this and makes a few adjustments i kinda wish id bought the la sportiva stream gtx or the asolo falcon gvs for around the same money hind sight is 2020 however if you are not doing a lot of rock scrambles and like speed hiking or want a high top wp trail runner these might be the boot for you they are great looking and stylish they do perform very well as long as your not on super rocky terrain hope this helps,1
just the right size i needed for my project,2
loved this black dress too bad was huge on my hip area,1
i bought suspenders to wear under a shirt to keep pants up on my appleshaped middle these would be uncomfortable next to skin,2
its exlarge fits like a medium horrible fit,0
awesome,2
bought one koloa hat and it was fantastic this one not so great top does pop up enough and bill is lopsided def returning,1
i wanted to really love this scarf so bad but the quality is just terrible,0
love it always complimented on cloudstyles blazers and this one is especially dashing,2
beautiful bag,2
i was a little surprised when i put these on because theyre not as comfortable as my other puma sneakers and i have a ton im keeping them but they wont be used for events where ill be in my feet for hours at a time i still love puma sneakers,1
although they are high quality these earrings dont stay on the ear like theyre supposed to,1
this watch is way to small for a guy and im not a big guy 57 and 155 lbs with normal size wrist barely fits around my wrist and looks like a womens watch i wore these old style casios for years a long time ago and this is not the same product,0
really cute and adorable anklets adjustable and doesnt slip past the ankle or fall off bought this for my sister and buying another set for myself because theyre so cute and comfortable and some of the best anklets ive seen lately,2
i selected my correct size with most other products and this product was way too big for methis product does not run true to size and i felt like it was cheaply made i had issues with getting a full refund from this company so i just said forget it and counted it as a loss,0
i think that this shoe is made for a lady with a wide foot,1
these are awesome sandals they are beautiful fit great and so comfortable my favorite brand the price on here for this brand can not be beat anywhere else,2
ordered 2 of these watches neither one works very disappointed kept forgetting to do return missed the window now im stuck with 2 watches that do not work,0
purchase was made to replace an identical pair lost earlier this year sadly one earring lacks some tension leading to the earring not remaining on one ear,1
it runs extremely small im not very big i usually wear mediums and large and i ordered a large and it was still way too small it fit my ten year old sister better i couldnt really get it over my arms and the apron couldnt fit over my boobs and im only a 36c so i cant imagine how itd fit anyone who isnt petite,0
the colors were supposed to be more vibrant as in the picture but the cheapness of the fabric took away from the whole shirt,0
he cannot wear it to school because of the noise,2
i got this for my bf as a gift and im very impressed its not too big but its very good looking he loves it too i got it in black very coold,2
looks and feels cheap very flimsy,0
this was a good buy i was abke to decorate my daughter crocs she loved how she could spell names and also add numbers it was the colors for me,2
these are excellent quality strung beads and really cute however dang the little rubber band loops that go around the arms of the glasses is so cheap the metal clasp is fine if you want to add new rubber loops they literally do not work stretch them as tight as you want 50 times a day they dont stay i contantly had my glasses hanging on by one arm then no arms then on the floor one of the strands broke all over the floor beads everywhere i dont even use them anymore but i do have them hanging on a lamp in my room because they are so cute,1
i like these shoes but even though i got the smaller more narrow size they are still a little floppy on my feet otherwise they are very comfortable,2
this suit is the best came fittign me perfect ordered a large and i am 148lbs 5 feet 8 34 inches tall 603 i look smashing oh and the quality is as shown and i am very picky thanks amazon 603,2
i ordered xl which generally fit fine these are very tight and the lining is very thin order one size up,1
great watch but my husband needed one that showed the month and year without having to punch a button,2
waist and inseam were ok but legs were cut too smallfor us and were too tight to wear had to return,1
original add says it is made in italy but actually it is made in china,1
petty nice shoes not anything to go to war in but pretty neat little flats,1
the lens on both sides of the watch where not attached,0
i had this on and off for sometime close to 10 months now i realized i end up taking it off due to skin allergy i doubt its as pure as they claim because i had one from another company and never had an issue i liked the design so tried this big waste of money,0
they fit well the material is soft and comfortable time will tell concerning the durability,2
fast shipping and excellent quality,2
received jeans immediately noticed that these are not official multiple points of counterfeit red tag doesnt say levis just a 3434 front button stamped incorrectly inside tag doesnt match product number inside leg tag non existent no red 3434 on back leather tag returning beware of counterfeit,0
picked up this as a secondary wallet lost original and wanted to try these slim wallets loaded it up with my cards i didnt have an airtag to put inside unfortunately overall its pretty good feels solid and well built does what its supposed to definitely recommend,1
nice shirt,2
cute i like it very much thank you,2
i like this long sleeve its soft and make me warm nice product for a cheap price,2
this dress runs very large i ordered this in a size s and it was falling off my mom who wears a size 6 i wear a 1012 and tried it on and it fitbr br it is comfortable on and is lined the cuff at the sleeves makes them not fall over your hand and look too long the sequins catch the light and look great there is a slit but it isnt very high the waist is stretchy and very forgivingbr br personally it isnt flattering on my body shape but it is a nice dress just make sure to size down,1
i think there are better choices out there buffs were ok but i am not sure they worth the price long and felt soft i think i could do with about 12 of the length and i would expect 12 the price,1
perfect for my son and his ballgames does not repeal water very well,2
the box itself is nice and the etched glass came out good but the box isnt as wide as i would have expected if you have invicta watches this box is not good for you,0
not much arch support the zipper pull is quite small and a pita when layered up in clothes to use love the tread pattern and traction ability hate the way they fit its like they were made by people that dont know what a foot is it rubs in all the wrong places,1
dont fit,0
i wear large sweatpants and have other brands that fit perfect these are so huge that i could fit three people into them i cannot wear these out of the house and returning them is just a pain i would love to see what mediums fit like but larges should be for someone who wears xxls very nice material but cannot wear them to the gym where i purchased them for out 80,0
these are dangerous when being used while driving under super sunny circumstances avoid getting hit by sun rays from the inside angle between the sunglasses and your cheeks it reflects off the sun,0
didnt fit me at all was too short in length im 58 and i really had to yank it up to fit my chest area had strings hanging out of peep hole area also no liner,1
they were nice,1
perfect comfy shoe,2
the look is sloppy and cheap very disappointed doesnt look anything like the picture,0
nice simple but classy watch i could not give a very good review because the band looks and feels cheap if the watch is worn daily the band will not last 6 months,1
much much smaller than pictured picture on model especially looked much bigger that they are these are really tiny,0
perfect for a visit to scotland,2
awesome looking but the quality left me wanting the glasses arrived on time but upon examing them the frames were bent and after only two days of use the plastic nose pieces became loose and one fell offbr br since so many people love these glasses i cant imagine that they are all that bad but maybe it was just the aviators,1
they came nicely packaged but the ones that i got are a 12 gauge not a 14,1
what can i say this is the most wonderful sweater and the color is perfect,2
out of the box this bag looks used it is very distressed looking i was disappointed it is extremely well made the leather is nice and the canvas is sturdy but it isnt appealing to me,1
but they should stick to making tractors,0
i want to love these but i cant i read plus size and for some dumb reason believed it im 55 and 200 lbs i thought the 1x would be fine cause i usually wear that size but this is more like a jeans size 12 of which i am an 18 theyre super comfy and feel great but wow are they tight and wow does my butt crack show,1
the idea is better than the execution i really wanted to like this respond but i just dont i have tried to use it many times and its just not comfortable and it does not hold the watch close to my skin in a way that feels usable oh well at least it was not expensive,0
i have 52 136lbs i got size large i do have big thighs i am short but the length wasnt as long as others i had to really shimmy in i ended up ripping them before a performance if i had a bigger size they may have been better very cute and professional smoothness,1
one size doesnt fit all to big lm older adult,0
keeps my feet very toasty and looks great with just about everything,2
cute but good luck on matching up that off color blue,0
product okay just got here late,1
i sewed the patch on my blue and yellow scarf and it works perfectly its a great way to show house pride,2
i wanted to like thesethey are very cute and soft unfortunately they were just too wide for my daughters feet and they wouldnt stay on the length fit fine but if your child has wide feet then im sure these would work,1
very nice looking purse used it for a wedding clasp stays closed and it is large enough to hold what you need for the evening,2
not very thick if your using this for covid cover must wear mask under,1
the helmet fits perfectly its lightweight offers very good peripheral vision and the buckle is ready to use with gloves i wear eyeglasses and several costlier helmets are next to impossible for me to put them on through the visor with this helmet is was problem at all the only downside to me is the tinted secondary visor while its simple to use while riding it is curved sharply upwards at the sides leaving a large gap on the sides and in the nose bridge dead center this gap really allows a lot of bright sunlight through its distracting and annoying fix that and it would be five stars easily,1
we didnt end up using them as they were too small for my 11 yr old,0
even for a 3x it was even smaller than i expected,0
very pleased with fit elastic band a little tight but should be better in time material excellent quality,2
works fine can be a little hassle to get to with the clip going over the zipper,1
this is absolutely beautiful looks just like pictures maybe even better seems well made beads are threaded through the wire on bracelets not glued in i love it,2
beyond expectations love the pocketsthe material is beyond cuteand its reversible i generally order a medium 810 this is a fit for all sizes its just a little too large but thats how i love my robes,2
nice pants but way too long i had to return i am 55 which is average height but i was walking on the pants pants were medium weight and appeared to be nice quality but pants were in excess of 35 inches long,2
this is great for a busy mom who needs to have her keys and hands andor babies i love it,2
nice costume or infrequent use worked very well for a sneaker ball or theme party very comfortable as well,1
socks are okay not really the comfy cozy i had hoped for they slide down a bit and didnt really stay on my feet well,1
whoever made this hates babiesbr im offended,0
have three pairs,2
will buy some more looks n feels awesomely great,2
not a good glass design started peeling off within a couple of days of use,0
broke after very little use metal prongs are cheaply made,0
its good basic leather a little larger than the business card holder ive been looking for but a nice wallet just the same holds a dozen or so cards with room to spare ill be back to let you know how the stitching holds up could be the one weak link,2
videoidd8be0ac641681bf3d8cbc9eb94f6812d needs rubber tips without rubber grip the card puller and the surface of the cards it can not grip on them,0
the neckline is boat neck bra straps are always showing,2
great for the price but definately get your usual size or downsize by one very large legs,2
too pointy for me,0
the size is good handles are sturdy the fabric itself isnt very durable it made it through 1 trip and had holes in the bottom by the end i used it to protect my backpack on the ferry to and from catalina island i suppose it did the job but kind of pricy for a onetime use,1
lacks a second window on the back of the license flip out viewer my badbr otherwise ok and soft like the stitchesbr ohpockets not consistent in size some cc and biz cards do not slide in smoothly in all pockets,1
it is bigger than expected but nice,2
i ordered a xl in this dress for a wedding it is super cute but too small i went by what other review said for sizing it fit nice other than the neck yikes i could not wear it i will keep and have it altered to work for me my suggestion is to size upbr 150 lbs 53 38d dress size 12,0
buyers beware these glasses is not polarized wearing it you will harm your eyes,0
this is a most beautiful sweater highest of quality choice,2
buy it,2
company did not have the original hat that i ordered they offered a similar style although i was disappointed my dad loves it,2
the back of this sports bra is fun but it does not fit according to the size chart the band was too large and the cup size wasnt accurate it also has really annoying and thick inside pads it was not comfortable or fitting i dont plan on buying another sports bra from this company,0
well i did like it but the strap broke after just a couple of weeks i didnt even carry anything heavy in it lame,0
a very pretty watch i am very happy i bought this watch its not bulky looking like other watches,2
great product at a great price though i would prefer the shinier nylon fabric than this soft matte fabrici like the fact that this has a much higher lycra content than most leggings,2
these are okay but they do not keep your hands warm under 20f they are more of a mild winter glove if you are going jogging in very cold temps look for something much thicker,1
the sweater fits but is not lose fitting like the picture,0
good for mild winters,1
smocked top area to small for anyone but a childno room for any cup size,0
very washable my wife loved them great gift,2
i liked that these were high waisted and had good reviews those all seem to be from 2020 though and i think theyve changed the style theres only about 15in of the waist part and thats a cheaplysewn elastic band the seam down the back is way too tight and very uncomfortable i didnt expect high quality for the price but these are below low quality added a star bc my husband likes the way they look so much,0
this was a christmas present for my wife she received so many compliments on them and she keep telling people how comfortable and not bunching they were when she slept,2
thank you for offering a size 13 as skechers run a full size smaller than other brands yeabr comfy shoes for all my daily running around,2
this is a low quality shirt looks sloppy on and the collar is not made right,0
very pretty bag love the color,2
love it,2
a faulty charm unable to fit on pandora bracelet,0
bar is to short,0
about 2 weeks after i had gotten this armband it broke againbr without any good reason which is i took off a glove and the little plastic closing thing just fell apartbr having had original swatch armbands my whole life in europe they are available everywhere already the feel of this one gave me the impression not to be original but then there may be a difference in the products sold by swatch in europe versus the usa so i cant be surebr but no armband however cheap it may be should fall apart after wearing it 2 weeks,0
the skirt us beautiful it only took 3 months to get it but its beautiful,2
the description didnt explain what these were exactly so it was not what i expected,0
the color is a nice color and goes well with many of my outfits both casual and not so casual however they have a weird feel to them they are a bit large and the bottoms are rather stiff i wore them for several months and then gave them to the goodwill i wouldnt buy them again,1
a bit tight doesnt fit the head,1
i bought this as a birthday present for my sister and she loves it,2
i love michael kors products i have several bags when i ordered this for travel i really thought that it would be perfect however it is really too small and more the size of a handbag my fault for not looking at the specs and the zipper on the top is metal and very garish to the eye for some reason this doesnt have the typical quality of a michael kors product while i will keep it its not good for travel its too small more like a handbag,1
only had it a week and already falling apart id plastic is thin and cheaply constructed not worth a dime,0
this is not at all a full costume i absolutely should have read more into the description runs extremely big,0
two of them fell apart the day after we bought it good material but not good quality,0
the look is the same as the picture however the length was extremely long,1
super cute but came broken,0
think ill really like this love that the ruffles hide my mid section wish id have paid more attention to realize this was just the top but ive now ordered a bottom,2
sadly i had to return them the fit was just too large,0
great sunglasses and not just for looks the polarization or whatever is great too theyre a little loose on my head but ive had them for a while now so it may be because ive worn them so much either way its not even close to being bad enough to make me stop loving them i can wear them on top of my head without them falling off or getting caught in my hair going to order them in black as soon as im done writing this review,2
holes in both pockets a month after purchase very cheaply made ugh its a very generous cutsuper roomy just a big bummer to have to sew the pockets back together,0
piece of crap gold beads and brown leather not black as stated no way to fasten and very big save your money,0
bought this as a part of a birthday gift for someone older who will just have to trust me when i tell him what it says its cute but the charm itself is so tiny 12 an inch in diameter in total its not really possible to read the words without using a magnifying glass so its not going to have the impact id hoped for,1
absolutely love these bought 3 in different colors will probably buy more feel wonderful,2
order in your size or down this was huge on me this is super forgiving and stretchy,1
the watch is a good concept setting the time and date were no big problem says its a germany watch but theres sticker on the back that says made in chinabr there are 2 buttons on the side of the watch the 2nd one fell off and theres no way to reattach it the 2nd button is used to set the watch i just keep the button in the original box in case i ever need to change the time or date other then that the watch is great bright green numbers are easy to read just wish the button didnt fall off,0
they look like the picture but they are so uncomfortable,1
too tight in the crotch,0
i really like this nf backpack this looks great and now i can carry my 1734 laptop safely anywhere,2
material is very cheap and thin you would definitely have to wear something thick underneath if you live in a cold place horrible look i am returning for a refund,0
too big and fame looking,0
i originally bought this dress as a find out my size purchase i havent bought a dress in over 6 years so i needed to know my sizebr i bought a size 18 i am 200lbs 66 inches tall 44 bust i wore this with a body shopping garment loved it,2
fits perfectly i love the color and design its helpful to not only keep my hair back and secure but keeps me warm as well great productbr br this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review,2
nice charm bought for my goddaughters bracket it does not have much weight to it but it is good for the purpose,2
hermoso el llavero tiene todos los detalles necesarios más pequeño que tu mano pero se ajusta muy bien como simulación,2
use for staying relatively dry while bathing my disabled hubby,2
i gave these to a friend he loved it its a nice gift for the guy who liked watches,2
thicker than i expected nonskid patterns work well on the hardwood floors feet are staying warm,1
i havent really had a chance to wear them much yet but started wearing around the house to get used to the arch these fit perfectly but still hoping i will get used to the arch,2
very small and the post to loop them through you ear is a bit bigger causing a minor pan all day i will be returning,0
awesome product,2
this is my 7th pair of jambu shoes size 9 these fit like 912 and i have to wear socks to keep my feet from slipping out of the shoes so i am disappointed,1
the dress is shorter than it appears from the picture im 54 and it comes above my knees other than the length its a nice dress,1
very flexible and fit well over childrens plastic arm frames comfortable according to my 4 yr old,2
bought these for swimming usa masters in february and lasted till august they fit great and look great i regular wash them in the shower with cold water and swim suite shampoo to help remove chlorine its been a hot summer here around august i am washing myself in the shower after a swim and start to notice my rear end has some type of dark ink i dont know if that is the chloraban fabric leaking from the waist but definitely was leaking and in the pictures you can kind of see the waist line with color fade as if something was spilled on it it also has a smell to it thats not very pleasant i dont know if this had to do with being exposed to so much heat because after i swam i sat out to tan in them i ordered another pair and gonna see how long they last this time going into the winter season,1
without the aid of another person there is no way to pull up the back to its full length which causes bulges and creasing,1
awful fit very cheap elastic not covered by cloth very uncomfortable and absolutely no leak protection,0
not for me,1
but they do pop of your shoes,1
in the photo the fabric looks like soft heathery cotton but its more rough and solid with an offcolor more orangish than red its not baggy unless you buy a size or two up its also not as long as pictured the model is wearing a completely different tank,0
their picture makes it look a more sandy color at least on my screen the shoe i got was almost a reddish brownbr br i could have excepted that if it was comfortable the shoe felt both too big and too small at the same time i couldnt get the straps to fit even at their tightest my feet still felt like they were sliding around this is after ordering a half size smaller than what i normally wear at the same time i felt like if i ordered any smaller my toes would be almost off the edge of the shoebr br the air bubble thing on the heel looks kinda silly in personbr br i returned it the same day,0
not covered by water prooftube,0
perfect fit love it,2
a little short for a taller gentleman,2
kinda gross and synthetic looking i was about to return it and realized it was cheap so i guess it made sense definitely not high quality its fine for one day but not recommended its gross to the touch,0
very confortable i just flew with them and they are very good my legs feel great,2
one of the pairs arrived with a hole in the leg and a weird stain as though they had been returned and repackaged i really didnt feel the low price was worth the hassle of returning so i just washed them a few times before giving to my husband to wear,0
this is not a wrap dress as shown the dress is completely sewn together the tie is a seperate piece they also did not include small loops on the side of the dress since this is not a true wrap dress so the tie actually falls down your waist as you walk as it cannot stay in the position you would like it to to look like a real wrap around,0
would give 5 stars but i ordered a 3 pack of largexl they sent one largexl 2 smalls the pair that fit are super soft comfy,1
i loved wearing them the 1st time he but after washing not so much tried to put them back on and several loose strings kept getting wrapped around my toes the compression is still good after the 3rd wash but you have to be super careful putting them on,1
pros this came in a massive nicely displayed box it came in time also for that it gets 2 stars now the cons this was advertised as a choker see pic not anything close to a choker this necklace is massive and bulky not dainty and small as one would expect as again its advertised as a choker sometimes less is really more gaudy not wearable art fair looking product if my 9 year old doesnt want it will try to send back pic shows it worn with a dangle choker to show just how off this description is,0
actual product color is a bit off what shows up on my screen the socks arrived with no indication of fibre content or washing instructions i washed in the machine on hot with normal detergent and dried in the dryer on high there was slight pilling but i found this still acceptable the socks fit well even after washing i wear a size 8 d shoe the fabric is soft and thick with a lot of elasticity the socks do not stretch out of shape with wear the construction seems to be solid with no loose threads or poorly made seams the insides of the socks are smooth and comfortable they are certainly not see through have holes stains look used or have any other obvious problems,2
these are really great mules they were surprisingly more comfortable than i was expecting i have wide feet and these were not too narrow for me i normally wear a size 10 and this fit true to size,2
this is such a fun tie the fabric quality is very good and its a pretty faithful representation of the scream as a closeup of the individual and with the orange cropped out i actually saw the painting in oslo and the tie does it justice the recipient of this gift just loved itprobably distills the whole office atmospherebr i received no compensation whatsoever for this review,2
i gave them away to someone i consider my enemy,0
i really love this it was super cute and comfortable however it is large normally this brand is right on the target for fit but this one was unexpectedly large i liked it so much i reordered it in the smaller size and it worked fine,2
this is my 3rd casio gshock watch 2 was an analog that only lasted 3 years so i thought i would try digital screen with the added information like a more legible day and datebr br unfortunately this black screen needs more contrast as you often have to tilt the watch into a light source to be able to read the screen built in light is not very bright so it only helps in the darkbr br suggest buying the light screen or the analog version instead,0
this is the most uncomfortable shoe ive ever purchased they were a bit tight the first wear but with thinner socks were doable the heel is very stiff and high though and blisters are unavoidable ive only worn them twice and dont plan on wearing them again,0
this product was exactly what i expected,2
even went down two sizes and the bra straps can still be pulled up to my ears this is not a high impact bra,0
was more like a shirt,0
i love it i might buy more of themlooks almost like leather i cant wait to wear it,2
i am 55 120 pounds and a small b cup i liked the dress but found lots of lose stitching and there was quite the gap around my armpits so it would probably work for ladies with larger bc the dress meets the floor and i hope it shrinks a little in the wash true to color and style,1
product is cheaply made flimsy thin card board is showing at swam,0
looked really cheap,0
good band perfect size very stylish,1
these earrings are fun to wear little one inch slices of a lime very cute i them,2
its ok my daughter liked it,1
cant get my orthotics in the shoe,0
it fit but is way too short in the back so you butt is literally out probably cute if youre very slim with small cheeks lol,0
perfect for happy mail for my customers,2
bought these shorts to prevent my thighs from chafing and they work great i love it that much that i bought more of them i use it when i take my walks and my bike rides light weight and dries fast,2
do not buy this if you dont like wearing tight anything around your face or neck or you have anxiety on the pictures it looks like its a big wide tube but its not it does fit a small child nice n loose,0
im going to return them i ordered the size i wear in everything and even on my right foot the slightly bigger one i was swimming in them,0
we gave them as a birthday gift and our friend absolutely loves them good quality and design,2
ruined after 1st wash,1
i gave this review 3 stars only because this is a thong not brazilian cut it is very cute and fits great,1
i bought this shirt for puttering around outside it is thin enough so it will not add a lot of heat during fl summers and long enough to allow me to bend over without showing skin or more i normally wear a size 18 and the xxl fit beautifully the downside is there is a large raised black mark on the top so it will be returned,0
very satisfied with my hat and the service on all my purchases,2
pos this is not a winter sweater very cheesy not what i expected at all,0
videoid6bb25f1910b7193b0e3ac0977fd24b42 i did not expect such a poor quality i also expected the neck of it in the back to be a whole lot different to where it fit comfortably i do not recommend this unless theres no other choice,0
it came with a black smudge tht i had to go and get cleaned and it still would not come out,0
they are more black then navy blue,1
had to return just a tad to large would love to get another pair but i bought these on amazon prime day so no offer to exchange for the special price loved the look and feel,2
love this style and color,2
underwire in the bra broke the 5th time i wore it i loved it until that happened,0
the product is ok but it came broken i guess it broke in the mail it does what its supposed to at least holds the jewelry and it looks cute i wish i could give more stars but this doesnt seem sturdy i was still able to use it at least but wont be buying again as i know it could break,1
i havent purchased this hat but theyve stolen photos from the briar baby website if you want a hat like the ones the children in the photos are wearing check them out they have excellent quality hats,0
its a bit fitted but all in right placesbr not suitable for the well hung,1
this pair of shoes lasted 1 and a half month before i changed it usually it takes at least half of the school year before i buy a new pair for my son i got size 1 for my 8 yr old fit as expected regular size feet not wide after 2 weeks it already got folds in the front and holes on soles i got 2 shoes from payless store during their 40 off everything sale instead and i am pretty impressed on what i got it cost me 13 bucks each but my son said these were very comfortable and light,0
these earrings appeared well made and delightfully detailed my wife receives many comments and compliments about them so why not a fifth star the box they arrived in made them look like a dollar store purchase though the box usually gets thrown away these are worth a better initial presentation a minor complaint really certainly worth the br br consider buying the cat pin as well you wont be disappointed,2
not as described supposed to be a 3 pack and only 1 arrived,0
im a size 6 with a fairly narrow footbr i bought a 6 and sadly they were too short and waaaay too widebr returned,1
fabric is very thin construction not good,0
big seems well made fits well in wallet a,2
they dont stay on your head theyre way too loose,0
i am new to spinning and hopefully adding cycling soon but these shoes are fantastic they are very comfortable and easy to get the hang of the one warning is for people with a wide toe box the show is very narrow in the front so if you have a wide toe box be careful that this shoe might be a little narrow for you,2
runs big like the other reviews say once i found my size i was very happy with them,2
bought size m for a 7yo she is skinny for her age and the costume is still at least two sizes too small the gloves are ridiculously small sized yet the boots are too bigsbr for 50 not worthy returned,0
device would not activate when following instructions for pressing reset button on initial setup followed troubleshooting steps on website but no response from reset button no phone contact for support only email poor support process and faulty device,0
not worth the price clothes under the jacket get feathers all over a disaster,0
the strap wasnt sewn on i had to sew it myselfyou get what you pay for i guess,1
great workout piece fits a little big but comfortable,2
it would be impossible to wear a sock of normal thickness under this boot,0
god did i love this dress its so pretty but sadly with someone with a 40b bra size i couldnt breathe in it i got it zipped but it was way too tight please please please make a larger size i need a 14,1
some of them doesnt make all the way in so if you stretch it belt comes out from watch,1
fit was terrible padding was like cardboard would not recommend,0
beautiful but runs a little small,2
i love this outfit,2
so cute but i sized up because i have a tall toddler and the waist is large so it droops the straps were also very long but thankfully they have two button holes to make them shorter or longer and crisscrossing thembr in the back helped a lot,1
they loved the hats gave them for the rehearsal,2
the fabric is super breathable and comfy but not supportive for jostled running tennis hiking sports etc the foot can slip too much from side to side my son said theyre very comfy though,1
we raised a bunch of kids using all lands end coats over the past 30 years i have watched their quality decline terribly though this coat is well made has all the best features fits well and has everything going for it i sent it back after struggling for 10 minutes to line up the zippers my 20 year old le squall has the same zippers that still work beautifully order at your own risk,0
it looks used very wide and poor material,0
the pants were too long for my small height and didnt expect an elastic band around the waist but the manufacturer corrected the problem in a fast and thoughtful manner which is much appreciated the pants were well made and warm like the adv said,2
cute and comfortable,2
these were a huge hit at an 8th bday party they actually lasted a full two hours of crazy kids playing,2
i ended up making this into a muscle t because its huge the decal is so large its like wearing a plastic bag,1
ty,1
little long but love it,2
very low quality worn off in a month,0
quality is great looks beautiful,2
really cute but runs a bit small i got them for my homegirls baby who is 11 months and they fit his little legs kinda tight,1
very pretty but a little to big for me,2
shiny kind of material weird also way too baggy,1
got this for my 5 year old niece to match her dance leotard she is in love with it it did smell terrible when delivered though like it was soaked in gasoline had to wash it twice and febreeze the crap out of it for the smell to dissipate,2
i expect that during a rainstorm water will enter the top two pockets in the front and the outside document pocket at the rear they have velcro closures,2
very casual dress if you are looking for something to bum around in this is good but if you are more conservative wearing a bra is a must as this one really is not complimentry on without one oh and for hawaii the fabric is too warm,1
nice and warm soles are not thick at all you can feel the peebles and small rocks on dirt road not made for other than snow walking,1
my daughter loves the pocketz,1
they were okay they slid down didnt stay up but were otherwise nice,1
the material is thin loos tread above all is not good,0
my daughter loves this its soft and colorful fits her perfectly,2
nicebut the other model is more old fashion and has more protection in critical parts and has too an nice design,1
very thin fabric you may want to wear a slip or leggings under the skirt,1
you had to be in the brightest and hottest sun to get any movement of the fan not much air movement at all chalk it up to 34novelty34 level gimmick,0
lightweight and good to run in because they vent easily but the lenses pop out very easily and they definitely dont look as good as the fully enclosed dadumas i also have,2
liked how breathable they are and easeofuse and colors dont like how the strings start coming apart after a handful of times of wearing also i dont know if this is due to shape or just being too big for my kid but he has to wear the back clear up on the top of his crown in order to keep it from falling off of his little 5 year old face,1
this dress is for sure what i wanted out of a summery dress i was looking for something casual yet dressy to wear to a wedding and i found it,2
fabric part is fine but the tassel part is coming apart at the ends sending back,0
i absolutely loved these earrings wore them for my wedding and they looked great gave them 3 stars because one broke as soon as i took it off the in the night after the wedding at least it didnt happen during,1
although the photo looks like the black and white pattern really 34pops34 this is actually a dull gray top i was disappointed,1
unfortunately half of the clips had came unglued from the flowers,1
i like that it has a front closure and its pretty but doesnt support,0
i bought the matching butterfly necklaces for my mother and me we are both bad about not being able to wait until christmas to give gifts to each other when the matching necklaces arrived they were so brilliantly lovely and wellmade in every way i went ahead and gave her the butterfly necklacebr br a few days ago i received the butterfly earrings they are so gorgeous and are identical to the butterfly pendantsbr br i was on the phone with my mom a little bit ago and i asked her how she was liking her butterfly necklace she said yes and that she was wondering if there were butterfly earrings that she could wear with it i started laughing and asked her if she wanted the rest of her christmas present she was tickled pink that i got her the butterfly earrings to match her necklacebr br i can highly recommend the earrings and the necklace they are truly delicate and lovely works of art i love the high quality 3 dimensional aspect and the affordable price i believe you will too,2
i love these slippers very comfy and seem to have plenty of cushion i hope they last me,2
great top but runs small,1
perfect,2
this necklace was nicer than i thought it would be my granddaughter loved it and it came in a cute little box,2
it was not what i thought it was i will not buy on line in the future i need to try the item on,0
at 62 250 i need a xl sweatshirt the one i bought before this one fit perfectly and after first washing the crew neck actually remained a crew neck not an oversized hole for your head then i bought this crewneck because the other fit so well and the sleeves are oversized way to much material the crewneck is just an oversized hole for your head and the waist stays stretched out comforts ok but not the best fit,1
the product alone was beautiful in its own way i was expecting it to be more or a cloth material it was more of a silk type material and it looks so great in the pictures and when i got it it seemed to be more of a bathing suit cover,0
cute but wouldnt stay on not worth the purchase,0
i wanted to love these but unfortunately these just did not work for my little one the quality and material of these is great but the fit is off i ordered the 1824 month size for my 11 month old hes quite tall and lean so i expected them to be a bit baggy but ordered bigger for length putting these on him they were basically capri length right off the bat i think these would be a great option for a shorter chunky baby but i would not recommend for anyone with a tall or lean little one,1
i like it but these socks do not always stay on my daughter feet,2
s size good for me im 52,2
depends on what youre buying this for i wanted to use it for a ball it didnt fit well and my friend said that it looked like a grandmas dress,1
taking a long time to break in even after starting with an hour the first day adding an hour each day but they are still comfortable just not all day shoes,1
pants did not fit i bought a 38x32 and it says 38x32 on the tag measured the pant and they are 34 inches waist now i am going to have tkfool with sending them back sooo disappointed,0
beautiful you may need a great foundation,2
i bought two of these belts and the love the look and the apparent toughness well made leather and grommets but the reversible part a very thin pivoting pin broke on both now i have two almost brand new looking worthless belts once the reversible pin breaks the whole thing falls apart,0
its ok,1
i need this in all the colors its super comfy to sleep in and wear around the house lounging its a tad big on me but 1 thats to be expected with the style not meant to be form fitting since its meant to be comfy and 2 im small anyway like 120 lbs 32 bust i cant decide what color i want next but the pink polka dots were super cute,2
my old eddiebauer sweatshirt had twolayers held tightly together where one layer added insulation with a bit of polyester this one had what appeared to be a single middlethickness cotton layer on the upside this one fit the body better and was more compressible than both old sweatshirt and fleece jackets,1
i do not not like the waist band on the pants i ordered a large so it would be more comfortable but it is huge on me i am 53 130lb this outfit doesnt fit at all like the model is wearing it,0
it broke the first day i wore it when the 34leather34 band fell off of the face of the watch i used jbweld to reconnect it and it has been fine ever since were going on a whole week now i love the look of the watch and it runs fine but just a heads up the quality may be a little bit lacking,0
light and easy to wear i like it,2
multiple pairs broke before even wearing them i shipped some in protective packaging and some of them broke too,0
ive been wearing these shirts for a few months now and the neck elastic on all of them are still in great shape cant complain about the price either much cheaper on amazon than in stores,2
they dont really work for my feettheyre always slipping off my heel in my shoes and its kind of annoying,0
these shoes look sharp my son picked these out for the school year unfortunately theyve only been worn to school for 14 days and the toes are already losing their color had i known they would wear so quickly cosmetically we would have purchased something else other than that we have no complaints and hell continue wearing these,1
i dont know what this was way to small confused to why i ordered it,0
not silver turned after 3 day,0
bought these in feb and my son already has holes through the bottomyes hes active but not destructive,0
lightweight zip up jacket to wear when a little cool loved it fit well i am a tall 5934 200lbs and i chose the xl,2
bought it for my daughter but when i saw how thin the fabric was i didnt even have her try it on i could tell it was too small and too long anyway i appreciate them allowing me to return it might be a nice dress for someone just not for my daughter,1
this became a hat decorating a st patricks day hat i had the hat and added this with some shamrocks made of green pipe cleaners and made the perfectly decorated hat for a party,2
i liked this purse but it wasnt as cute in person basically looked like black jeans turned into a purse that being said it is still a cute casual bag just didnt work for me because there was no good spot for my phone,1
i am very pleased with these pants they are a very good value,2
looks great on me,2
is more like an xllove the material but it is too tight around the middle and bottom,1
ive been wearing altra shoes since lone peak 25 and have the torin 45 which are great fit well and have a supremely comfortable tongue system the torin 5 unfortunately changed the tongue system so that is hits right at the joint in the ankle especially during flexion of the foot the rest of the shoe fits will i hope they update the torin 6 with the 45s tongue,0
loved these sunglasses floated great lensthe arm fell off within a week picked them up out them on and it fell off cannot put it back on disappointed,0
worst bra ever never stays zipped all through my workout i have to stop and rezip ridiculous,0
if you are heavy chested order a size up downsize i did that and the bottoms arent fitted and the shirt is still a little snug but doesnt stretch the lettering,1
at first i received an empty envelope had not been sealed this was corrected and a new order sent out immediately received quickly however i was shorted filters sent six instead of eight still dont know how well they work after all this hope they work well,1
the bra cups are completely sheer and do not fit its like having tissue paper barely covering but also it doesnt fit so its crumpled its impossible to get on properly its extremely difficult to latch in the back all sewing and fabric is extremely cheap and poorly done it is a garment i would avoid on a dollar rack doesnt look like the photo,0
nice dress doesnt fit so not as expected asked to return and shipper was agreeable and helpful but postage was 75 at my expense so not worth it to me i will donate it somewhere,0
fit weird with wide loose bottom and snug near top but had funny shoulders that stick out,0
this wig is fantastic i was expecting cheap and messy and we got a high quality very pretty wig it fits me and my 10 year old so very versatile,2
i used the slippers just for in house wear i was disappointed in the quality of it it wasnt long before these slippers became too loose on my feet but i was especially disappointed with the slippers developing holes and having the inside stuffing come out and this was just from walking in my own home mostly on carpeting and not outside with adverse weather or stony rocky or sharp surfaces i wish i could purchase a pair of slippers that are both comfortable and durable,0
cute shirt but runs way small and can only be dry cleaned spot cleaned and its already started falling apart cheap material,1
this was a great product we initially bought it for the stage show and it rocked i love to upload the picture,2
this skirt is very pretty and i like that there is two layers of tulle type mesh and then an liner layerbr br the only issue is that it is too small if you are unsure of what size to get youll definitely want to go up a size,1
sock fabric feels nice run smallbr i wear a womens size 7 wide shoe these medium size socks feel too snug will return for large sizebr hope this helps your sizing needs,1
great jacket its stylish and functional and has a lot of pockets,2
i really like these gloves but the left one is a size bigger than the right,2
fits way to big cheap material,0
the purse was beautifulwell made i returned it because it was to large,1
shrunk after a couple of washes,1
tiny they lie about sizes,0
it is not what i expected can i return it,1
nice looking shirt the lines are clean and it is very flattering,2
the length and clips for the shirt are finebr br one of my major complaints is the foot loops sewing makes it never sit flushbr br the other complaint the one that makes me not be able to stand wearing these is the metal clip near the ysplit since the foot loop doesnt sit flush it twists the band left and right well when it does that you have the metal clip digging into your skin or pulling hairbr br plastic adjustable clips would solve the issue that prevents me from wearing these,0
i bought the the same sweater at the official fjalraven store inperson so i was a little skeptical to order online in a different color but it was true to spec,2
big fail amazon while the cut fit and the stretchy material is great the butt seam is wrinkled and not flush against the fabric like the other seams im not sure if this was only in the 2 pairs i tried but either way its a quality control issue if you want a lump line in your butt crack then these fit the bill,0
not as pictured the hardware is silvertone not goldtone and none of the pom poms have the snaphook on the chain which is in the photo of this item im not happy,0
really pretty but my friend said it gave her a rash i guess just be careful if u have sensitive skin she loves it as a car charm tho lol,1
too small,0
this is a bootleg t shirt and in no way is supported by the band the only official merch is sold by the band on the bands website this tshirt is crap quality,0
i mean let me be fair its inexpensive so no surprise its okay itll get the job done for how long not too sure not too sure at all,1
the cut is flattering and color is as shown perfect right wrong sweat seeps through like nobodys business it literally looked like i peed 210 would not suggest if youre gonna sweat save them to lounge in or do something non sweaty,0
when i first put this on the lettering which says rezag rats that is on the side of the left leg was stuck together i actually had to pry it apart because it was like the letters melted onto themselves lucky it was not damaged nevertheless i have no idea what that saying meansbr br these yoga pants are very comfortable they did roll down periodically at the waist they wash well inside out but i hang dry them if they did not have this nonsensical lettering and the waist did not roll down periodically i would have rated these 5 stars,1
purchased size small listing says length is 39434 but the dress i received was 4434 length too long also the dress is see throughbr going t return,0
do not waste your money as usual i purposely ordered 2 sizes up since its online clothing this outfit is made for a very petite person if fit more like a 34 length shirt and capri tights for a small frame person,0
love these shirts for the price and the fact that i am a big guy and they fit loose is a plus,2
i bought these for my soon to be grandson my daughter in law opened them her babyshower and everyone luvd them cuz their so cute however they are 2 different stlye shoes i need to exchange them right away and getbr a pair that matches,0
fit was ok for me legs were snug but in a good way so they shouldnt ride up too bad elastic is thin and cheap as are all the materials usedbr br they are what they are but probably wont last you long,1
it is cute but did not hold my shawl together any pull and it comes undone,0
my husband is 63 and weighs 300 lbs i struggle to find clothes for him that both look good and fit well he loves this shirt and i love the way it looks on him i purchased the 4xlt the length is perfect with ample fabric to tuck in the vented sleeves and rear yoke make the shirt very cool and comfortable its classic styling is suitable for casual activity as well as sunday morning church this one is a home run and we will order more like it in the future,2
the material of the tank tops are good but the sizing is way off,0
they were super comfy but they run slightly smalli would recommend these to anyone looking for their staple black shoe,2
ok,2
pierde el color rapidamente,0
broke down,1
i bought this product for a friends christmas gift its extremely smaller than i thought it would be for the price the logo is almost unrecognizable if you dont know lsu colors youd try to figure out what it is,0
fit was tighter than expected and the finish and quality of the material was less than expected,0
love this piece would order again,2
perfect for the need very sturdy and easy to open stay closed consistenly too,2
real thin,1
this dress is petite which i am not i was recommended to buy a size up to accommodate for this but that didnt cut it this dress is super tight super short i have a larger bust so maybe itd work for someone with a smaller chest or someone actually petite like directed decent material though,1
soft,2
bought as a gift,2
way to short in the legs,0
this shirt is beautiful and works for casual as well as formal look the only downside is the tacky golden buttons i am returning this because of the gaudy buttons,1
what you see is what you get,2
material was a thin jersey type shrunk after first was is comfortable but for more casual settings,1
i bought about 7 of these a year ago i have now used them numerous times travelingbr i have had no problems with them breaking so they seem quite durablebr the blue color that i purchased is very easy to see on your bag so easily identifiablebr i would for sure buy these again i now only use these luggage tags on all of my bagsbr the metal coupler has never unscrewed,2
i had high hopes for this item since they were not cheap sunglasses but i gotta say they are a little flimsy feeling like i could bend them very easily yes they are light weight but not in a good way in my opinion,1
pretty and dont hurt my ears,2
runs very small will try again and order up,1
poorly made cheap flimsy fabric i do not recommend,0
they fell apart to fast for the price i paid for them wouldnt recommend them,0
this glove perfects fits my hand it is elastic and will fit all hands i gave 4 stars because it should have to be bit thicker,2
not warm enough if you work in surgery it is not lined and you can actually see light through it i am 5334 125lb between a 4 an a 6 and its a smidge too big i have not washed it yet but dont think it will shrink the sleeves stop past my thumbs when i hold my arms and hands straight down a coworker who is at least a size bigger than me put it on over a shirt and a pullover sweater its winter now found it was snug but she was able to get in on without a struggle i would say that a small fits a 68 well but its not warm enough for the operating room it is feminine but as you can see from the picture the shoulder edges are quite angular maybe a bit too stylized the waist is drawn in for a nice silhouette and i find the pockets to be conveniently located and such that your phone or whatever will stay in and not fall out when you bend over or about as one does as a nurse relatively attractive not warm,1
difficult to read and not accurate,1
these are super cute to wear as a necklace but also to see love them,2
my daughter loves all things ballet and purple is her absolute favorite color so when i see this i knew for a fact that i was going to have to buy it for her not only is it wellmade but the color and sizing are very true to what you would expect when ordering i was super happy with it now my daughter is very tall for her age so i did order a bigger size but i have to do that with all clothing for her so thats not a big deal the lace on this is beautiful and even after wearing quite a bit and washing a few times it has held up wonderfully the skirt is so pretty and looks great with the leotard its easy to get on and off thanks to the functioning clip on the back although it did take me a minute to figure it out all in all this is a beautiful outfit for practicing ballet or simply wearing around the house as a dressup costume im going to be getting another one in pink as well,2
these were fine if used around a swimming pool to keep your feet from being scraped i made the mistake of using them for hiking through water and wet rocky areas if that is what you need buy something more substantial,1
color not as expected but its a very cute blouse i ordered the pink in small im 52 120 lbs and its a little bigger than i expected but i can alter it because its really cute however what i got was a blouse that is bright pink with red flowers not more of a lighter lavendery white with pink flowers as shown none of the other colors available match what i received at all i reordered the pink to see if it shows up as it looks on website if not i have no idea what this seller is doing will update,1
the material is not sweatshirt material it is a thin funky material the photo is deceiving i received a message from the seller and they want to give me a partial return if i dont return it also something about not paying for return shipping i an returning it today it was advertised as free shipping and returns lets see if they honor this,0
way to long and high waisted,0
the straps keep ripping i purchased 3 of these and each time the straps rip off,0
love the concept but the knit fabric showed the outline of my phone and overall just too bulky for me,1
very disappointed order a woman xl and once it came i couldnt fit it end up turning it to a night gown for my 5 yrs grand daughter,0
not true too size much smaller,0
the ball broke on the second day and grabbing the card does not work when i try to put the card out of the pinch is a total failure i lost my money,0
i like that you can take everything you need i would suggest a wrist strap i use one from another product,2
nice style i ordered a half size smaller and they still slip off my heels,2
its a metal id tag on a piece of velcro i got it because im not crazy about wrist bands which interfere with gloves it does work on the shoelaces of my mountain bike shoes obviously its not for road shoes or any others that use straps instead of laces it doesnt give you much room to type in your id info which is a drawback and the price seems way high for what it is and if i could have actually looked at this product in person i probably would have saved my 20 but it does the job and i use it so thats a good thing,1
this purse is cute and a good size i bought it to be able to carry a book and soda on flights it worked well but after just 6 months it has at least 3 rips in the lining and one zipper is broken,0
i have this dress in stripes and its a dream but this one has a costumelike sheen on it i wish it didnt have,1
good quality,2
size way up i wasted my money on a medium currently have a xl on the way hopefully that fits would love a refund for the too small shirt,0
soooooo cute great product and quick shipping our daughter is in heaven,2
to thin material thought i would try thinner socks but i miss the thicker more cushy sock plus i wore them with cowboy boots and they dont stay up would probably be good for dressy shoes but not as active wear,0
the style of the bag was awesome leather was beautiful but the stitching made the bag look really ugly and dowdy,1
videoid3c3b92e573357bd4d6c3f82a7e2b54db i ordered this little romper to use as a gift to a local organization that works with children and which often needs help getting baby clothes as a grandma i think its a very nice onesie that has just the right amount of stretch to it the snaps work well and appear to stay snapped even when you pull on them this is important to me because when onesies first came out the snaps were notorious for not staying snapped the only down side to this outfit is that it does have kind of a chemical smell to it so i advise washing it first before you use it with baby just to get the softness into the material and the smell out other than that its a cute outfit that is not genderspecific meaning it would be great for a girl or a boy i received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review,2
arrived very late and one of the nose rings was completely smashed out of shape these nose rings are definitely not silver as the listing says the nonbroken one turned my nose black after just a few hours of wear,0
nice heavy watch keeps good time,2
34c this is a bit big id exchange them but i dont care for padded inserts which tend to roll and crinkle in the wash too much of a hassle to deal with,0
does not provide good support returned shoes will spend more and get a good pair,0
super cute bracelet color is great and seems well made i gave it as a gift it came nicely packaged with a gift bag and even had a blank gift note and envelope,2
cute but way too small the model in the picture must be 5 tall and 95 lbs,1
at first it fit okay but on the first time that i washed it it became extremely saggy and did not hold together well the inside material hung open and constantly bothered my nose,0
shirt was too long shirt went to my mid thigh and im 6 foot,0
theyre lovely and feel good but the back is a bit skimpier than other pairs i own and as a result these give me a semi wedgie i have a small butt so i imagine this would be worse for anyone that really has anything back there,1
this shirt is thick but transparent so youll need something underneath the drape is also awkwardalthough the pictures look like it has an offcenter cut its actually a symmetrical 34v34 up the middle with lots of fabric bunched outside your hips which makes them look wider recommended for anyone whos pencilthin and trying to widen a bit not recommended for anyone whod prefer something slimming,1
in comparison with other joggers or sweat pants i have purchased this just does not look good th ribbing makes it look so bad they are comfortable maybe 30 in length i bought 3 pair and sent 2 back kept the gray the black and navy were worse i would have sent all 3 back but i needed a pair like now would not recommend,2
perfect,2
my wife bought this for her phone and was very pleased when it got herethere have been some great advances in fake leather34very rich looking34,2
great product perfect fit vibrant colorsbr the flowers did fall off after a long days wear but we used fabric glue and sewed on afterwards,2
fit is great after wearing 5x the seam little threads are showing the pants are not tight so i dont understand i love these pants but am,0
i was hoping it would fit more cards it was not misrepresented though,1
super comfortable my little one loves them they are perfect for the beach because of the rubber but are also nice enough to wear out and being white they match everything theyre great,2
these drawstring bags are a great deal they are sturdy enough to hold a few books for class or a change of clothes or shoes much nicer than the price would suggest,2
i recommend ordering a size big these definitely run small the material is a little thinner than some suits so it does have a little more stretch which is good because of the sizing issue the breast pads move all over the place so its probably better just to take them out they are cute and look good thiugh and i would order again but in a larger size,1
its for very tiny wrists,0
i ordered a large and it was way tight in chest area waist too,0
too saggy for my liking but still a real cute hat,2
eh its ok kinda looks like im wearing a towel lol,1
if i can find other footwear with this much comfort and breathability ill never want for another brand,2
liked this ring at first eventually it stretched out and slid off my finger theres a name brand that costs more but last longer too,1
i wish it was not one size for a woman i dont have small hands glove size 75 but still these gloves are about 2 inches longer than my largest finger and about 12 inch at the thumb they are very bulky also the velcro to take off and keep back the mitten part is too small and at wrong location for smaller hands,1
videoid4b22a14850fec5c314d9340a1b4e5fff this spinny tardis necklace is very poor quality the tardis wont spin it gets stuck there is no detail or attention to detail the paint job is very poor with bubble spots throughout the finish looks and feels very cheap,0
beware of the size conversion it runs small,1
perfect fit love the material very comfortable,2
the packaging of that watch is very bad good for 3 dollars is fine at least you could put it in a box because of that the screen has been broken,0
its ok for the price,1
cute abc comfy but poor quality washed it when i opened the package per washing instructions and the seam came undone at the waist band going to return it,0
love love love this shirt silky soft and looks great with everything,2
they say 30f but i worked in 20f at my work and my hands would numb up in about 20 mins of being in their pointless gloves,0
cheap quality pearls and stones were missing,0
i rarely write a review but this canvas tote bag just needed one it is the perfect size to hold my ipad kindle wallet lip gloss and still have room for extras without looking bulky another plus is the zipper to close the tote which is a big plus for me ive only been using it for a short time but it seems to be very well constructed i purchased the gray and it is very stylish,2
love these boots best investment for the winter so many compliments super easy to get on and off i plan to buy other styles,2
the jacket fits as expected its warms for cold maine winters but it tears easily at the seams ive had to sew it twice already,1
i love this it makes me feel safer walking with it it can do some damage if necessary the best part is it just looks like a key finder and is undetectable because theres no metal great for self defense,2
i bought it to wear it to the airport or just to run quick errands it fit true to size and stayed as was when i washed it the only thing i would be mindful about is the drawstrings try not to pull on one side too much or it can completely come out and you would have to put it back through the hole other than that i really like it and will get other colors,2
this shirt is described as 34wine34 but when i got it it was clearly not the color wine i was very excited about this shirt but very disappointed when received it was hoping to be able to get another shirt but havent had a response,0
ive had this purse for about a year and though i love the color i dont like that its not a very sturdy bag and tends to bunch up and fold around its hard to find items in the pockets it has a nice casual look and seems to be of high quality but i will be looking for a sturdier purse in the future,1
theyre ok they easily get sand in them i use them to play beach volleyball in the summer months when the sand is too hot for bare feet the rubber attracts heat and makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear the quality of the material is nice though,1
it is okay i ordered a short because i am short but i wish it was longer,1
very small,0
run very small,0
these knee socks could come up just abit higher,1
broke after one use,0
so easy to spot on the luggage conveyer very sturdy,2
i receive great compliments whenever i wear this pair of earrings inexpensive item and yet wonderful to look like a million dollar thanks,2
my grandson loves his truck shirt,2
quality is not great at all waste of a few dollars,0
am very pleased with this product good quality material,2
great deal,2
videoide5f4f21914c95b819b48a9b89c973d27 son bastante buenas algo delicadas pero muy funcionales,2
really cute and soft not much to them though,1
this didnt say it was from china and it was way too small for size xl price was kinda high fir the fabric,0
love it good looking practical and sturdy,2
so cute and comfy,2
fit sort of funny,1
this is a 3piece 4 piece if you count the belt for the robe which comes in one size only i purchased the black on and havent tried the gstring but everything else fit nicely and comfy i ended up going back to purchase the pink one afterwards,2
the product is made very cheap horrible will never buy again ill probably end up just doing it awaybr i end up throwing the product away the material is horrible whoever thought this was a good shirt i feel sorry for them,0
la calidad de la tela no es lo que esperaba,0
great product does its job very well highly recommend these bags,2
looks cheap,0
this is a beautiful replica of my staff sergeant rank insignia i pinned it onto my af veteran hat and it is a good addition,2
i like the pattern but runs way small i am a skinny person with big shoulders so bought a large so it would fit my shoulders fits like a us xs in my opinion,1
the armholes have a weird fit and the shirt itself is very boxy its not flattering at all for anyone who has an hourglass or pear shaped body darts or pulling in the side seams in a curve would have benefited this shirt its not see through but its really not worth itbr br i cant recommend this shirt,1
the fit it really big so it just looks bad on,1
this dress is way to big and the material has a very artificial feel i will not be wearing this dress,0
the watch is great but the strap is kinda weirdly designed the side with the holes is much longer proportionally to the side with the buckle and it makes the tail end of the strap come up too far,2
very classy,2
soft fabric,2
this is cute but it doesnt function as described it is supposed to be an earring cuff but it doesnt stand up so it just dangles and doesnt look good im returning it which is unfortunate because it would be cute if it functioned correctly,0
like it but the color is too yellowish,1
it is pretty bad quality i had to cut off so many stray strings from the stop its only worth about 4 i hope it lasts through the wash,1
up the middle of each cup is a seam that doesnt lie flat look closely st the picture under t shirts its noticeable too bad,1
these were not comfortable at first but i think the legging style just takes a little while to get comfortable after wearings and washings they are quite nice now and i am happy with them id buy another in a heartbeat but this brand seems to have made too small a batch for sale and then discontinued making them which is very frustrating for the consumer ive encountered this with others of this brand and style and i think it is a terrible way to do business they started out at a very good price then the price kept going up and up and now they are unavailable and apparently wont come available again any time soon who is responsible for this debacle it seems to me a company ought to make enough of a style and product to serve the buying public and not run out of their goods this way,2
this is cheap made hats torn very easy and would not hold up 20 mins after wearing,0
love this watch its very cool i bought this two years ago as a present or my husband and he uses daily and the strap its really bad quality i have to find a replacement strap,1
got it for my daughter its one of her favorite pieces of jewelry,2
i bought a size medium and it was big on me,1
the design is super cute but its small and the material has no give the buttons are pretty iffy on quality im not super confident they will hold up and the front pockets are fake i might take a gamble to size up but i might just return it and let it go,1
flimsy but nice thought,0
i bought the holder to be able to take my necklaces with me the unit doesnt stay together everything moved necklaces were a tangled mess horrible construction very disappointed,0
over all the bag is cute but the straps are made way to long and are adjustable but still way to big for a child,2
i love the fabric as does my husband florida heat i think its actually shorter then it should be,1
sent to my brother for christmas br he loved it and wore it proudly to the pickle ball courts br fit was good and it did not stretch w wash dry br good buy and fun gift,2
need instruction manual as to how they think this will stay on my ear it does not fit,0
it arrived with two of the colors broken but otherwise the colors are very pretty and stick well,0
i read in the description that this gown was all cotton it doe not even feel like cotton i am also suprised that lands end would offer a gown like this feels mostly like some kind of polyester i would not recommend,1
nice sweater ordered it in red and it is salmon in color it gives color to the face and looks good the fit is okay boxy not flowy if that makes sense it will give you volume on your upper half and its structured around the waist as it curls in being petite it kinda makes me look larger than what i ambut it could hide flaws and it is uber comfy i am giving it 3 stars because it came with two holes in the sweater bummed,1
cutest dress ever,2
these were a gift to my husband he loves them and wears them everyday,2
these are very cute and i will enjoy wearing them anywhere but on my ears these hurt like the dickens they are so large that they cover the earlobe and then hang over even more at the bottom which i dont consider attractive just my opinion and they are very heavy they made my ears terribly sore i have never had earrings that hurt like these ive had pierced ears for many years ill modify them by shortening the posts and then wearing them as pins i wish they were just a wee bit smaller and more comfortable as they are really pretty,1
for me these sandals did not work the band over the top of the foot was not wide enough and didnt have any give for stretching the toe strap area seemed like it would have been fine the quality was good i was hoping for a little more elastic in the foot band the foot bed seemed comfortable and well made just not for me,1
to small in the arms,0
very pretty but broke within the first month,1
cheap quality you can barely make out the design wouldnt recommend it,0
these gloves are perfect for toddlers my little one is 16 months old and they fit her perfectly and they stay on she doesnt like taking them off so i assume theyre comfortable,2
great fit and very comfy,2
too small,0
two of the 3 shirts fit well the other was waaaay smaller than the others but labeled the same size,1
i received the sweater today and i was very eager for it to comebr once it came i was extremely excited until i realized the horrendous material it was in its so cheap and the entire sweater can fall apart when washed just once its also extremely difficult to zip up very see through this is more of a halloween costume than an everyday sweater you can wear in public its just horrible it looks nothing like the picture please dont waste your time by buying this product like i did find a way better one,0
wish it had worked,1
not very flattering dull color,1
i ordered a large before it was huge i have a 38 bust it should have been tight i ordered a medium now 36 it is still huge it does not give it tight feeling at all theres plenty of stretch but thats only when i pull on it i wouldnt recommend this their sizes just runway too large,0
little flimsy but will work,1
these were way too small they might fit a child i ended up giving them to my little cousin,0
good magazine,2
used on foster baby fits well has held up,2
yissang womens pullon office business casual ankle dress pants trousers with pockets size xl color blackbr im 56 tall 125130 lbs i normally wear a size small or medium or 6 or 8 pants i received an xl when i ordered these slacks 95 polyester 5 spandex hand wash only inside outbr br even though the slacks are too large for me there are many things i can talk about the material is polyester and very shiny the pants have a 29 inseam they look pretty long on me but thats mainly because they are too big there are nice deep pockets on the front that give the pants style it also looks like there are two pockets on the back of the pants but they are not real pockets just there for the design the pants have an elastic waist in the front it doesnt look bad but in the back it makes your rear look saggy there are belt loops on the pants that just dont seem to fit the style of the pants the pants kind of look like fancy dress slacks that missed the mark i am going to give them a three stars since i am not sure if i would like them more if they were my size i really tried hard to make them look okay and thats what they are okay hope you found this review helpful,1
i think these were supposed to be fitted around the arms but way too roomy then again i have skinny arms had to return,1
this is a great brand i was dismayed when the shoes didnt fit i already own the same brand size and color,0
these leggings are very comfortable and when you run they stay in place and dont fall down i am 52 and where a large in pants the bottoms flare out on the calf not really made for short people,1
this suit is cute bottoms are a bit racy but not too much especially because the top covers well,2
okay it appeard to be silver,1
this is a very trim fitting long sleeve tshirt i have it in size m and it fit tighter than normal for a m size right out of the bag and even tighter once it had been laundered its wearable as a layer under another shirt but too tight to wear alone the tightness is especially apparent on the arms both in terms of circumference and length i would recommend sizing up one size at a minimumbr br the material is quite thin and the top buttons are just decorative instead of functional as they often are in a henley style shirt the head opening is tight as well since the button flap is pretty shortbr br on the plus side the material is soft and comfortable no issues at all with hem stitchingbr br if this were properly sized it would still not be a 5star shirt due to the faux buttons and thin fabric once the sizing issue is added in its a below average 2star shirt not one i would recommend,0
great bag fits a lot inside without feeling like it weighs a ton,2
better price than landsendcom supima cotton is so soft snd comfy love it,2
i ordered a medium and it was wayy too big and puffy 53 135lbs 29 waist and 375 hips if you have a smaller waist order down a size or two also the string to tie it wasnt in there very well and came out in the wash immediately i am not happy with these pants,0
ended up returning because the clasps are nearly impossible to close,1
looks good very cheap you can tell they are made in china,0
very thin material,0
i love this dress the colors are sooo bright and it is soo comfortable it is a lil short but i do have legs for days i am 57 and weigh around 190 i ordered an extra large as usual and it fits fine with plenty room,2
i love love these sandals awesome comfort for a high arch i bought a second pair in another color because they are so comfortable,2
cute and soft scarf fits my 5 year old perfectly the elastic band keeps it from falling off,2
was a lots of ones that didnt worked,0
they fit as expected just gets fuzzy quickly,1
bigger than it seems,1
bought right size but just didnt fit properly for my body frame,1
ive bought several pairs of ryka shoes and i was excited to find these boots they are comfortable easy to put on and the stretchy cord makes them supportive sadly after a couple of weeks the tabs that hold the cords in place shredded and broke away from the shoe i like the boots enough to see if i can get them repaired but the quality in this one regard is sorely lacking,0
this is top quality leather that is beautiful however after six months one of the pins that holds the band in place just snapped causing my watch to fall off this therefore impacted the overall quality rating that being said the customer service is 5 stars they immediately replaced the band,2
my daughter loves them fits perfectly looks great beautiful quality,2
it fits as expected its very comfy and stylish looks good with and without hair,2
dont waste your money go with rayban,0
i am very disappointed that these glasses do not make a difference for me while driving at night,0
tee was a gift for my sister and she lives it,2
fawnoxford tan is a nice neutral and the color is as pictured at least on my screen size 7 fit as expected these are definitely a low profile flip flop but with more substance than most nice cushioning and some arch support they seem slightly narrow not a problem for normal width but it you require a wide width these might not be for you i would give these 5 stars but current price range is anywhere from 3245 which seems a bit high if you find them at a price that works for you go for it they are comfortable and good quality,2
a little small and very short you will definitely need leggings or shorts underneath,1
granddaughter used this dress for tea party very cutevshe lived it,2
sent the wrong size no way to return them without a car dont like paying ups a pick up fee for a low cost item they will be a donation to the local thrift store,0
i thought i was getting a mid length but got a full length which was to long i had to get it shortened because i needed it for st patricks day dinner,1
i gave this turtleneck to my granddaughter to wear i liked the color and it was not too heavy material i would recommend that you make more colors a very fine product was very satisfied,2
i ordered the burgundy scarf but in reality its a dark red color i have a gray one that i love but i needed a pop of color for an evening wedding and red wont work ill be returning it,1
super beautiful have this since january looks like diamond necklace very versatile match with my diamond earrings,2
this necklace was purchased on march 30th after wearing for a month i noticed one part of the necklace had tarnished the rest of the necklace is perfect ive tried cleaning and polishing it but nothing helpsbr i cant return it because its over one month for returnsbr ive had good luck with their chains before but very disappointed with this one,0
they were smaller than i expected,1
very comfortable love the pockets,2
this shapewear does just what i needed smoothing unwanted bulges beneath silky summer fabricsbr i am writing this review after having the shapewear 5 weeks and wearing it 4 or 5 timesbr i have carefully followed the care instructions line drying to preserve the elasticity the high waist is all still shaping as expected however the longer legs which are wonderful by the way because that part needs some shaping too are now riding upbr they really need the rubber geldots or stripping that ive seen on other itemsbr while i wear this with skirts or dresses if i was using it with snugfiting pants the legs would be a serious issue,1
much smaller than advertised i will keep them as backup ok quality,1
i love this dress its so cute and fun the skirt is a pretty thick material so its not see through at all unlike some of the other versions ive seen on amazon i specifically chose this one because it said it had a full length liner underneath im not a fan of maxi dresses that have short liners in them i just dont like that look this one didnt have that problem it fit perfectly on me and i can wear 3 inch heels and it would be right above the ground very comfortable material and just a cute design all around it did come a bit wrinkled but nothing a steam iron cant fix i am a little concerned about washing it though not sure if the green will bleed all over the crochet top,2
very nice,2
adorable,2
i bought this for my niece she loved it its great quality,2
the sizing of this product is no way near as it is described,0
they are gorgeous hubby and i loved them and my mom loved hers as well,2
very cute except the color was a little off it looks red in the picture but in person its almost a hot red orange color very bright,2
i really like this chain the clasp could be larger for my 58 year old eyes but the size is perfect and it is shinny and nice,2
great product but i need the next size up,2
great product fits very well will be buying more,2
i have an oddly shaped bottom and it causes many pants to fit ill on me my hip bones are rather wide too for a male and that causes even more duress so its really hard for me to find pants that just fitbr br so far dockers fit the best at first but after a couple of years the bottom begins to wedge in these wranglers feel like a new pair of dockers except theres a little more room in the groin area which i need to prevent from riding up behindbr br i like the flat front because they rest easy on my legs both when sitting and standing the end drops nicely into a break on my shoes and the khaki is a standard khaki color youd find on most pants so expect the color to match with whatever ensembles you already havebr br the fabric is softer than other khaki pants so im not sure if the cloth will ball up after washes so far ive washed it once right before my first wear and there have been no fabric rolls,2
this outfit was super cute for my daughters 1st bday i only wished the headband was more sturdy,1
oh my goodness i am always cold so so excited to get these pants when they arrived in the mail i immediately noticed two things one they were very very thick which was good to they looked small i did put them on and found that they were shorter than i wanted them to be and were so sick it was difficult to squat and was slightly uncomfortable to bend my knees it felt like too much material they also were not stretchy so it would slide down my rear when i squatted,1
i really like this it is very pretty the reason i am giving it 4 stars is it twirls in the area of where the bolo attaches i am worried it is going to break but it is very pretty,2
smaller then expected,1
i purchased a 3x and it fit like a xtra small,0
floor length for my 53 height thick quality feeling material but bust area is too large and gaps around armpits my bust is 34c i bought a medium but should have gone with a small,1
very cute and well built true to size my so loves them,2
i like the length and the skirt just a lil disappointed by the color looks old,1
straps break easily,1
good quality pricesbr a comfortable walkbr various activities are possiblebr match matches well with any fashion,2
very very comfy great color super thin down side is they snag so so easy within the first day of wearing after a week about 30 of them is snaggedbr also fits small i usually a small medium and the large fit best,1
sólo tiene una lámina externa de supuesto cuero una estafa,0
i did not like this shirt the colors were brighter than shown in the picture,0
i like them they are simple hoops the silver color is good but the gold color is just odd not even close to the shade of other gold jewelery it is darker,1
un poco grande,1
i love these leg warmers i wear them during winter tofrom the gym when i have leggings on to stay warm,2
very well made product strongly suggest american buyers up size by two sizes,2
ordered an adult large and got a small that is marked as a large order several sizes larger if you are ordering this,0
cute silver anklets for any occasion some have two or three strands of cuteness my girls absolutely love these,2
the backs were so bent up when it arrived and i didnt want to bend it back my luck it would be so weak it would break off if i tried i returned it,0
waist band is stretched out too far,0
i really like these but they run a touch small i need to lose a few pounds so i shall,2
very hard with no stretchbr would not recommend,1
awful looking cheaply made which is way to small to fit an average person purchased the large medium is my usual size and got an extra small cheap looking top do not buy waste of money,0
i tried a pair in a store and they seemed to fit nicely so i went ahead ordered them online at first they also fit ok in general terms they seem wide and long enoughbr br after testing them outdoors they started to feel really uncomfortable its like they were made for a different shape of foot or something really badbr br i can wear them just for a couple of hours,0
this cute dress can be a tunic or mini dress you will need to wash it and press the wrinkles out before wearing it its a beautiful dress on and goes with lots of tights leggings and hose to create different looksits very stretchy fabric and will expand or contract to fit anybody,2
ty,2
they are cute and shiny but so weak and thin,2
cute but there was no size 10,2
there is no way these are real stones they look like plastic beads not true to the stones in the picture at all the silvercolored piece is really cheap too it is hollowed out so it is not very solid at all i guess i shouldnt have expected much for the price but the pendant is still really disappointing after reading the other reviews i knew it was going to be rather large which it is i was going to make into a key chain and give it to a friend as a gift but not now looks like i bought it from the dollar storebr i bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review,0
wish there was a bit more support they are comfortable though,1
it came with black streaks on the white material,1
every one of the costume jewelry pieces i purchased on amazon looks terrible the saying you get what you pay for is appropriate,0
im very pleased with this pair of shoes i can wear them all day without any problem just what i was looking for,2
just high waist no extra tummy support,2
runs slightly smaller than expected,2
with the design the hole ride up to upper thigh,1
nothing much to sayan apron is an apron served its purpose,1
material is thick and looks high quality i bought a medium and could not even get it on because it was so tiny i am a size xs s for underarmour i returned,1
quick and easy to use,2
awesome patches,2
after a few washes the purse strap come undone and disconnect from the shirt,1
these socks fit ok but after the 1st handwashing they frayed inside are now hard to get on as your toes catch on the fraud,0
48 pairs items arrived as described well packaged in double clear bag and velvet pouch so many different pairs to chose from and match your outfit of the day i have a nickel allergy and these are hypoallergenic so theyre ok for me to wear wont be shopping for earrings again anytime soon,2
very useful product,2
i love the fit of these jeans but they are very very long i decided to keep them and hem them myself i am 58 and had to hem these up 3 inches dont buy these u less you have extremely long legs or dont mind hemming,1
love these,2
me and sally like to dress up in the bedroom this is a little big on both of our heads but has been a great addition to my larry mahan edition milano cowboy hat,2
perfect fit i borrowed this hat from a neighbor for my 5 month old to use at the pool and it kept the sun off his head and face i immediately came home and ordered one to have i love the drawstring so it wont blow off in the wind and that it will grow with him i also got one for his 2 yo sister and the boy who owned the one i borrowed is 7 youll never have to buy mother sun hat again,2
the first few times wearing them they were fine fit nice comfy but after about 34 washes they starteed pilling and the seam on the side popped open these were not tight in this area by the knee where there is extra fabric for bending and bunching up so i have no idea why it just burst open over all not really worth it for me,1
perfect for a halloween costume lower quality but fit my needs,1
good,2
as described,2
warning ladies get out your pasties because this shirt will let you know the temperature in the room a quick once over with the steamer and wrinkles were gone in minutes im a nursing momma right now so unfortunately wearing pasties with this shirt isnt an option but it will sit in my closet for a girl night out or a date its light weight but not sheerbut thin enough to need pasties on a cold day,2
nice pin but to expensive,0
its soft but a lot smaller than expected,1
super cute,2
another wonderful experience shopping with amazon,2
had to send back,0
vintage,0
xl fits more like largemedium,1
super cheap but a fun design doesnt do much for eye protection but great for style and fashion,1
if you have a very flat stomach go for it,2
ribs small cheapand itchy,0
itchy material on the inside i can barely stands to wear them,0
i mean its a gown soooo,1
so cute good quality,2
these run large and the fit is odd around the neck never saw a tank top made like this,1
update daughter wore these shoes for 30 minutes for an indoor photo shoot by the end of the shoot all the jewels were gone what a waste of moneybr original upon pulling this out of the box i noticed that it is missing some of the little jewels also comparing it to other shoes noticed how they are a bit smaller than all of the other size 10 shoes that we have,0
i am so disappointed this costume is so poorly made just opened the package and it is already falling apart the bra is way too small to tie around even a preemie baby and the beads have scuffs on them i am amazed by how this product has so many good reviews,0
these look as good as raybans at a fraction of the cost they are super lightweight and the price was an excellent value for the money they protected my moms eyes completely when she had cataract surgery,2
super cute cozy and soft my 5yo put it on right away and loves it,2
a bit tight and good in warmer weather but they come up to my knees,1
nice quality,2
i expected something of hire quality its ok not great,1
i ordered 6xfits like 4xzipper is on wrong sidenice materialcheap so i kept it,0
cheap materials,1
not for d cups no support,1
nice chain and necklace,1
fit too small but that was my mistake in ordering but i was cute overall when i received it,1
who doesnt love orange in heavy rainstorm i was afraid this cutie was going to blow back on me,1
cross is cool chain clasp broke on it,1
i am a substitute and the students really love them,2
pinchers are in great shape the o rings all fell apart but i had spares i just wish they were separated and labeled having to measure them was a hassle,1
ordered for a size small woman but got the large it just fits glad other reviewers noted the size issues it is not hemmed on the bottom of the top the straps were not put together in the back and it was difficult to attach them for the price i am satisfied though not delighted well see if it holds together,1
these are just okay the inside suede is crumbly so it gets all over the inside of the window see close up photo also the 34blue34 is actually more like a green see pictured next to an actual blue luggage tag,0
my son loves this mask it has a pocket for a filter and is 3 layers thick before adding the filter in,2
i like it but it seems that it was packaged carelessly i had a missing button the watch was out of its container in the package the container was bent and there was a minor stain mark of some sticky substance other then that i do like the watch,1
this pos did not work at all im between a c and d cup and it couldnt hold my boobs up it wouldnt stick its made of a super thin lace like material that rips easily its all in the garbage and i ended up wearing a real bra that showed through my dress cause of the deep neckline,0
i couldnt keep them on my ear very pretty but wouldnt stay on my ear,0
does cut down on the glare but the vision is a little blurred this is due to my vision problems so i should have ordered clip ons instead,1
i only buy asics but i usually buy them in person at a local retailer i decided to avoid the hassle and order them online big mistake and wont do it again all my other asics have fit perfectly and been so comfortable but these are slightly small for my feet seem a bit narrow they are also not comfortable like the others i have purchased in the past i guess when it comes to stuff like this buying in person is the best policy,1
dress very pretty but with the stretch top and large chest it pulls the top to empire high and make you look like a boat,1
i little tight around the bust and therefore the dark blue shows a little lighter,1
too small find fit,0
i really like these socks my 1 year old daughter wears them often and they wash well i would recommend these socks,2
these were a replacement for an older pair my wife has been wearing for over 5 years she loves these sandals and thinks they are the best better than ant flip flop,2
a less spandex then expected they stretch out pretty easily,1
smalllmore like for a toddler than a 10 year old,1
this jogger is so cute comfortable i recently traveled in it it was perfect and priced reasonably for a 2piece quality outfit my plan is to buy others,2
i really like these flared tunics the patterns are very pretty they are not very form fitting though i think they make me look pregnant it seems if i went down a size it would then be too tight in the shoulders,1
i chose the size by what i thought i would wear unfortunately the pants are huge ill just have to deal with it or put them in a donation bin,1
if you like your tities showing then this is the product for you,0
this was the perfect gift for my daughters birthday she has just taken up fishing she loves it,2
the length and width are true to size the straps are a little snug over the top of the foot this allows for a more secure fit than other flip flops if your feet have more redundant tissue they may be a little too tight for comfort arch support is very good and soles provide plenty of cushion,2
it is more like a jacket than a coat it is very thin there is no collar basically it is just a thin layer for faux fur and satin like lining this jacket is straight cut and there is no collar it almost seems like it was designed as a vest and sleeves were added i ordered a much larger size coat than i typically wear and it is not that much bigger on me so it fits small the coat i got is pure white and reaches just above my knees it has no collar so chest area is exposed because coat is not fitted i believe it would look cute with a wide belt to give it a little bit more shapely form the price at the time of this review around 26 plus shipping so you get what you pay for a cheap coat 3 stars because of small sizing and how thin it is for sure not a real winter coat maybe a california winter,1
doesnt fit like a charm should fit the sticker or paper heart inside is off center and some of the words are cut off also the cover of the heart was very dirty and wouldnt get off i was very disappointed,0
i bought this in medium and for reference i am 57 38dd chest about 165 lb and 3 weeks postpartum i was looking for a dress that would be flattering on a post baby body and i was drawn to this one especially because of the buttons since i am breastfeeding unfortunately the buttons are not functional and cannot be undone which i didnt realize prior to ordering the dress feels very comfortable and honestly would probably work better if i had sized down to the small because i feel like it makes me look a bit boxy i think the dress runs larger than normal especially with adjustable straps so i would recommend sizing down a fullsize when ordering it is very cute and the fabric feels good overall i think it definitely has potential but this particular size that i ordered just didnt work for me i am including a few photos just to provide a closer look at what to expect i hope that helps,1
my husband ordered size 13 but they looked more like a size 10 and didnt fit him at all it was almost like they were mislabeled because hes worn size 13 aldo shoes lots of times,0
came with no instructions not sure how to use afraid i could ruin my expensive watch,0
the short sleep top works great as a lab jacket when paired with an under shirt,2
these work well for goal bracelets or reminders the colors are really good on these and some of them have an inspirational message on them if this type of anchor works for you i would recommend these,2
came without mask will return,0
it is a pretty nice bracelet for the weekends or as a casual evening,2
these are the worst pants ive ever owned if i could rate them negative stars i would nothing like shopping and noticing that you have a massive gaping hole in your crotch area and this is the first time ive worn thembr br i highly recommend you do not buy these they are cheaply made and not good quality whatsoeverbr br additionally im 58 and both the xl and xxl are way too long too much fabric to even roll up,0
wore this 1 time put it through wash lint balls everywhere too late to return,0
very cute and well made but small i bought for a 1 yet old but gave to a newborn probably 36 mo size,2
i prefer bathing suits that are not so long that they come to my knees i am shorter so im always looking for non board short bathing suitsbr br this bathing suit fits me perfectly it falls mid thigh on me its not too loose and not too tight the image made me wonder if it wasnt going to fit overly tight which i wouldnt want any more than id want it to be baggybr br make sure to choose your size based on the sizing chart provided by the manufacturer i found it absolutely accuratebr br this bathing suit is comfortable to wear all day at the beach or lounging by the pool the material dries quickly and looks greatbr br this is definitely a bathing suit i recommend it is one of the first suits i go to when getting ready when im heading to spend the day at the water,2
didnt like they didnt feel good on my feet,0
i bought two pair of these earrings to give as holiday gifts they are absolutely beautiful with a choice of many colors asinb006kwjvc0 honey sundrop simple earrings glass and sterling silver i particularly like the high tide color but have gifted other colors and styles as well as necklaces in the past asinb006kwkaru candy cane 18 sundrop pendant glass and sterling silver asinb006kwk04i cobalt sundrop kite earrings recycled glass and sterling silverbr the gift recipients were thrilled with the earrings mostly because of their striking beauty but also because they are made in the usa by a company that takes the environment seriously,2
i love these shoes so much they are the most comfortable running shoes that i have ever worn i wear a 10n they fit perfectly,2
horrible material and very deceiving from the actual picture,0
love this wallet great and holds tons i ordered two different sizes well made,2
the only thing i didnt like was that the arch support insert is hard i replaced it with another insert which is easy to dobr setting this aside i ordered this brand shoe because it is exactly what my old shoe was but in a larger size,2
the top did not fit right had to reorder another size,1
loose fitting not snug on the foot but comfy i wear a 9 and the 910 size fits like an 8 in length,1
so another pair that wont work for my nipples because they are too small apparently the jewelry designers assume everyone has micro nipples reality is have a baby and any hope of regaining small feet or small nipples is gone in my case have 4 more and your sol that you will ever get a nipple cover that fits,1
they dont look anything like the photo the shoulder pads are totally flat they look like there has been a concrete block sitting on them i am very disappointed,0
houses are not what they say and i dislike some of the fabrics arent good,0
these snaps go great with the gwen thong sandals they go with any color and have just a little bit of bling but not too much,2
i love them but i got all of them in a size 8 and some are way too tight i also only wore them for a day and they already started turning my fingers green,0
not the best fit or quality but cute message,1
purchased for my adult daughtershe normally wears an 8 but i bought these in 85 for her even so they seem to run too small according to her,1
good material and feels nice pairs well with shorts or dress up with black pants,2
my 9 year old has a shirt similar to this onealso from ua its apparently his favorite shirt because we started noticing when we went out that he was almost always picking that shirt to wear we started fearing people would think that was the only shirt he had this one is slightly different in the design but its made out of the same material my son finds it comfortable and the other one has held up well to many washings weve been practicing social distancing lately so he hasnt got the chance to wear this one out but once we get back in public i fully anticipate that hell be swapping between the two as much as he can i also like that there are several other colorsdesigns in this shirt so we can add some more variety for him,2
warm gloves but they run a little big,1
funcional y bonita,2
my daughter likes this style of hat i ordered this for her and she loved it,2
the coat is has a lovely design pattern and is warm my reason for three stars is how thin the coat is made,1
originally i gave these five stars because i really liked them but ive only been wearing them for a few days and the paint is starting to chip off they actually make my ears really itchy and smelly which i hate and i dont really feel like they are the exact size they say because they fall right out if they get bumped,0
bought for my aunt and it didnt do much for her in her opinion,0
nice weight not bulky in design big heavy sleeve openings and very smart and tailored looking im very happy with this robe but i did have to have the 2 belt loops lowered as they were well above my waist cost me 850 but worth it im guessing theyre selling this robe to both sexes maybe,2
too big sizes are way off i received an entirely different dress no shape to the dress but what else would you expect from the price,0
the cap sleeves stuck out instead of lying flat,1
cute enough but they pinch in the toes and back of heel rubbed and i dont have wide feet not as comfortable as a similar pair different brand i already had sent them back,1
material much thinner and flimsy than expected concerned over how they will wear with jeans etc will not reorder,0
i like this but the sizing seems to be a bit off its now too big for me but not because ive lost inches haha i use hot cream with it anx it works great but the velcro breaks down easy and is now not wanting to stick very well i would size down,1
these are gorgeous gorgeous the appeal is this doesnt look like every other bridal shoe on the market today i liked it because it gave me the illusion of a 21st century cinderella shoe for the bride and im so glad i get to wear it on my wedding day,2
good product,2
daughter wears a size 6 or 6x i ordered a 120 and it fits perfectly,2
fits great and looks great,2
good buy,2
i purchased my normal size and ended up returning and repurchasing one size up the first one i received was way too small and the second one was way too big there was a huge difference in the sizes very disappointed because i really loved the dress from the pictures,1
a little large,1
the material is very flimsy not recommended if youre a serious cyclist,1
these are great for the price,2
its to small its uncomfortable as well,0
pretty dress but i ordered a 4x and it turned out to be a size 1416 gave it to a friend not plus sized at all,0
i grabbed the black one and tried it on and i loved it i then tried the red one on and it seemed like a smaller size than the black one overall i love these tanks just not happy with the siffereneyin the two,1
very cute earrings and all arrived intact i have sensitive ears so i was a bit worried about how long i could wear these but they dont bother my ears at all nice variety as well great for the price thanks,2
you get what you pay for they sat unevenly on my face frames were off,0
the first thing that was asked after opening why is it so thin honestly doesnt look like the ring in my book would not order again,0
love these star earringsthey are delicate but not too small wish they had leverbacks instead of fishhooks but other than that i am very happy with them i would buy them again,2
awesome price,0
honestly there okay theyre very cute and warm super soft too but theyre a little stiff and the boat neck is quite a bit bigger than portrayed in the pictures theyre great for around the house or if you need base layers under your everyday clothes but i probably wouldnt pick them for any kind of activity like skiing or snowboarding,1
i had these glasses for less than 1 week they are broken at no time were they exposed to any thing that should have led to them being cracked on the frame thereby letting the lens fall out not happy,0
pinched at the toes,1
this mask was purchased for my daughter for halloween she was a zebra it was stunning and completed her costume wonderfully she received many compliments on her entire outfit,2
this star headband is spray painted and since the zip ties are flexible the paint crack off before you even open the box there are much better star crowns on amazon skip this one,0
my sons two favorite things sharks and pepperoni pizza he absolutely loved them shipping was on time,2
bought broke so i exchanged the replacement butterfly anklet broke first wear so not durable the other anklet hasnt broke but i actually bought the set for the butterfly anklet,0
like the low heels of the shoes the fit was true to size i ordered a size 9 and it was perfect,2
this is red not hot pink disappointed,1
honestly its hideous as a sundress runs short so your crotch is likely to show whenever i wear it i tie it off to the side so it makes a tank top that actually looks pretty cute,1
i found this bathing suit to fit my daughter true to size my daughter liked the cut and colors and the material felt like it was good enough quality however she wore it for the first time yesterday and there are several pills and pulls in the rear end of the suit again after only one wear we live near the beach my kids are on swim teams we live in our bathing suits and i have never had this experience before with other brands after the first wear very disappointed i would not recommend this bathing suit,0
these gloves are perfect the fit snug on your hands but not too tight the give in the fabric makes the fit perfect the touch screen use is the best ive seen from a glove ive never had gloves that you dont have to hard presss to get the screen to move if that makes sense theyre just warm enough the grip makes them great for driving on cold mornings i love them,2
i ordered this thinking finally a bra that will fit bigger sizes without payer over 40dollars i actually ordered a size up and it was way to small i ordered a size e and it fit like a dd definitely not true to size really nice looking and feeling though to bad i cant use,0
also needs to be somewhat longer and taller one of the zippers failed to zip close didnt force for fear of damaging the zipper,0
i really wanted to like this set its super cute and inexpensive its decently made the fabric is on the thin side but thats perfect for summer the stitching is a little bit 34off34 but for the price its not a big deal they are true to size my biggest issue is the appliquès initially i was impressed with the qualitytheyre a sort of plasticy feel and my boys loved them but once they went through the washer and dryer and yep i did follow the instructions on the tag and even dried them on delicate the interfacing started to peel off and shed on other clothes and shrank so the appliquè itself ended up curved and wont sit flat ill be returning these im so bummed because they really are super cute and would be great for the summer months but the quality is lacking,0
fit was nice but the leggings are see through despite what the description said ill be sending these back for a refund,0
these are sooooo small so tiny ordered my usual size medium and they were way too small barely fitting my extra small daughter waist was like 27 across on the medium this is not modal this is cheap cheap cheap polyester and super thin each pair had seam holes right out of the package very poorly made product avoid,0
pendant and earrings are beautiful and seems of good quality but necklaces quality is poor it turned black after wearing once not too happy about it as it was a present,0
its not as roomy up top as i wanted,1
poor quality the seam in the left sleeve came completely apart after the 2nd time wearing the sweatshirt i do not recommend this product,0
my niece loved this ballet jewelry box her mother was delighted made for black hispanic children,2
i got a new pair of prescription glasses which pads were uncomfortable for me those pads were hard and the manufacturer didnt make any softbr ones these silicone pad covers allowed me to keep those expensive glasses,2
so pretty,2
thin material,1
i bought this stuff to get the chlorine smell out of my swimsuits and i dont think it does much at all for the price i followed instructions exactly and my suits still smell strongly of chlorine,0
good product,1
these leggings are so comfortable and soft not sure if i would wear them to the gym but theyre great quality leggings and i will definitely buy more colorsbr br update ive had these for months now and they have not faded and they are also great to wear to the gym not see through at all and my all time favorite leggings i had to order more,2
if i could return it for a refund i would unfortunately ive been away and didnt get the chance to see the build quality until recently for 120 i would expect the handle and stitching to at least be straight,0
product arrived and upon opening was met with the overwhelming smell of mildew internal wrapping felt damp and product had mold on it,0
its cute but it doesnt look like the picture plus material is like a rayon,0
i have received great reviews from my female coworkers on how flattering the style is will be ordering again,2
this ekouaer womens sweatsuits set is good to wear lounging around indoors on a chilly day the fabric is soft and comfortable as described this twopiece outfit has side pockets and elastic on the bottom of the pants what i dont particularly like is the color of the outfit i chose which is not flattering on me and the grey band that emphasizes the chest area,1
im small 98 pounds and the bag hangs at an odd angle when i wear it water bottles the main reason i got it are too heavy and crooked i wont use but probably someone regularsized will,0
i bought this dress for a funeral she loved pink so this fit in perfect i wish it would of been a couple of inches longer because i am 510 but overall i love it,2
doesnt look anything like the picture provided the letters are hard to read and it looks like a piece of paper glued in it no moon image was on the background either just plain white i would not purchase any charms for pandora bracelets unless they are sterling silver and tarnish resistant you got me this time though,0
poor fit heavy materialpicture looks better than actual garmenti gave it away just poor quality,0
this seller will charge you shipping for whatever size you choose first and then the rest will be free shipping same price lol play smart shoppers,0
this button down hoodie was thin and soft and comfortable to wear its great to lounge around in on a weekend or when you just want to relax and not get too dressed up though i would not rely on it to keep you warm in the winter unless it was layered with other clothes beneath it,2
im normally a l10 and everyone said size way up so i got the 3x they actually sorta fit but they just make me look hugeeee theyre also definitely longer than in the pic returning,1
great exactly as expected and fitted,2
this hat was much much smaller than i thought it would be i bought it for my husband but it barely fit me i would only recommend it for a child,0
t shirt is a good basic shirt and fits true to size wish it was more olive color like in the picture but otherwise fine,2
very nice shirt,2
the dress is soft and cute and true to the size chart,2
its ok runs big,1
there was no shine at all it didnt clean anything,1
super easy to use quality item durable no more pulling at keychains to move keys on and off the struggle is over,2
watch fit in great comfortable to wear and so far has not broke on me i build scaffolding for a living and this thing has been through a tough couple days so far and came out in good shape raised face is nice to help protect the screen and the buttons are still accessible also the mic and speaker are unobstructed so they work very well still also,2
great sunglasses they fit well and look great i recieved this product at a discount for an honest review,2
it doesnt look like the one on the picture,0
good for one time usagebr used it for going to korea from usbr when i arrived to korea missing wheel and few spots was about to rip,0
i live the fit and fabric but the three strappy things are too big and wont lay flat ill keep it and maybe after washing they will shrink a bit,1
i liked it but the charms broke off extremely easy i lost the cameo my favorite charm then the whole bracelet snapped,1
a little large the color is bright and just like the picture,2
this dress is so fancyi was almost hesitant to wear it to church it is also very comfortable i would recommend this to everyone,2
perfect they are so long they go all the way under my ass with some left over im 5434 98lbs so i fold them down its good because they wont slump down with so much extra fabric quality is good shipping was like 1 day even though amazon said they werent due till jan30feb 2nd it comes in a 4 pack and all 4 colors look like the photo this price cant beatbr br im a tiny girl and it fits my thighs pretty snug which i like however if you have larger thighs it might not work there is very little stretch,2
started falling apart after first use,0
sort of weird length on me too longlooked frumpy so i returned im 5234 140lbs 7 mos pregnant,1
first off these are adorable super soft slippers the color is true to picture and description true to size nice nonslip bottom reason for only 3 stars is that they wore very quickly im mean quick after only 2 days wish there was better padding,1
it is not very bad but definitely not impressive as a single earring and this price i dont think it worths the money i am returning the material is cheap and light not elegant at all,0
didnt care for this at all the fit was a little small around the mid section and way too big on the top it didnt sit onoff the shoulders very well looked like a rag had been thrown on i am on the full figured side about a size 12 so maybe it works better on tiny petite women i returned it,0
i so wanted this headband to be perfect but it came and it was very small ears and they did not stay in place,1
nice color and fabric not thin but the sizing is off definitely size down the dress was too big and the ruching was off,1
this is a cheap costume but my son used it for halloween as part of his bank robberjail bird costume started falling apart after he played around in it you get what you pay for,1
good quality shirt for working out comfy and nice material,2
lovely color very thick and warm and i can spread it over my shoulders like a pashmina to keep the cold out,2
poor quality and it fits big on me,0
very cute top but runs very small i bought and xl just to be sure it would fit and unfortunately it didnt fit me but fit my daughter who is xs,1
videoid37208a1017b7b3b2419a2f598c1d1285 i had high hopes for these but they are too thick to go through the hole of any of my shoes or sneakers they are only made for shoes with large holes possible converse type sneakers if the holes of your shoes are as small as the ones i displayed they wont workbr br i gave it two stars only because the concept is a good one they need to improve the ends to fit smaller holes,0
big for a newborn but they still work pretty well,2
i bought the red plaid shirt and i plan to keep it i like the material i like the weight i was however disappointed in the red tone its more of a red orange color not the true red i was hoping forbr br perfect fit i got a small,1
this thing is not very good it turned green after only 2 days and caused me to get a rash,0
smells great but very strong,2
did not like the fabric at all and the quality was lacking overall,0
the fit was good purchased xl and normally wear size 16 the dress came missing a bow on the front pocket so i cant wear it bummer,0
these earrings arent as nice as they appear in the picture very poorly put together and cheap,0
this is lightweight so much that nothing is hemmed and every side of it has thread coming out which i dont see stopping unless i sew it its large enough to tie attractively but i dont expect this scarf to last very long,0
colors looked different on the website i thought it was black on the bottom its brown a little disappointed,1
these are amazing glasses for the price im about to buy another pair,2
i really wanted to love these slippers the pros are they fit are cute are well made and super warm the only con and its a big one they are really hard on the soles and have no cushion or arch support i might as well be walking barefoot on concrete even in areas where i have rugs in addition the insoles are not removeable so i cant even add my own insoles if you are wearing slippers to sit on the couch and maybe walk to bathroom occasionally these will work just fine but if you have hard floors and wear your slippers a lot like me these will not work,1
looks nothing like picture very thin not heavy cable knit as shown got xl for comfy oversized look and i could barely get it over my head very disappointed,0
videoide726e4da40598b356b7f0d2fd6f2c5c1 prosbr sneakerasers overnight shoe cleaner soakbr no scrub detergentbr no harsh chemicalsbr safe on rubber canvas leatherbr do not use on suedebr removes tough marks scuffs dirt stains grime etcbr only requires 1 scoopbr consbr did not remove dirt from side of solesbr requires scrubbing to really cleanbr br i ordered this to use on mine and my daughters tennis shoes i have a black pair of tennis shoes that have some white accents and white soles and well the white is not white anymore they were pretty dingy looking i went ahead and put one scoop of detergent in a tub of warm water and left them not just over night but also half of the next day until i got off work i will say that the water i dumped out was pretty dirty i did notice that some of the white areas did look a little whiter but there was no real difference to the sides of the white soles i took a scrub brush and scrubbed the soles all around each shoe and then scrubbed each shoe over the top a couple of times my shoe laces were pretty dingy as well i did notice a little less dinginess to the laces but they still need a scrubbing to be honest they look a little fresher and smell a little nicer so for the little effort i had to put into it i would say it was worth it i would like to try some of my kids shoes as well so all in all i would recommend this product to others i feel that if you could get 1520 uses of this container which would make it just over a dollar per treatment makes it worth my time,1
brought this for presents my brother for his birthday he wore it yesterday it fit wonderfully and he loves it,2
not the best material remains wrinkled,1
very soft,1
i purchased an xxl however these are about a us size medium these advertised they are fleece lined and they are not there is no fleece inside the photo shown in the advertisement did not have these huge square pockets on the front which i didnt really care for at all i am stuck with them because i dont live anywhere near a drop off site to return them also they are extremely thin not as described,0
i bought this dress but ultimately returned it because it didnt fit my shape well im a curvy hourglass and this dress just looked like i was wearing an oversized tshirt the fabric was pretty thin as well so overall it just wasnt a good fit for me,1
love the skirt except it arrived damaged the clasp portion on the back only had one side in place so you cant actually secure the waistband,1
wrost i ever bought never buy again,0
very happy with this brand the seller shipped with care and even followed up with me a few days after receiving the boots a,2
im a very overweight person that goes on walks a lot with my dog most of my walk is on a gravel road then some paved road ive used other walkingrunning shoes one pair has a soft soul and rocks cut into it other were great but broke down really fast overweight skechers shoes fit well feel great and rocks are not a problem arch support wishes it was better but that maybe me not the shoe that can vary depending on the person so i plan to add some support there only had them for two weeks and my feet fell great,2
these are okay i ordered a different pair of gloves by this brand that are way better link httpsamznto30eubci unlike the gloves i linked to the touchscreen on these gloves doesnt work they also dont seem as warm or comfortable i know the 3m thinsulate is supposed to be topnotch but the gloves i linked to which dont claim to have thinsulate seem better than these if i hadnt already ordered wore the other pair by this brand i think i would have liked these gloves more i just think the other brand is better btw the other gloves are ski glovesbr br materials are all synthetic pu polyester made in china where else,2
not bad for the price but its really a good one time use kind of wig it served its purpose however,2
this set was cute the color was greatbr the top fit me great and i actually really liked itbr br however the pants were a problem the pants material was really thinbr could clearly see underwearbr br they also didnt really synch anything in you can see every bump and roll i had usually leggings kind of suck all that stuff inbr br i think if you are very fit and dont wear underpants these will look great but wasnt for me unfortunatelybr br had to return,1
great buy,2
gift,1
it was very snug to wear wasnt what i expected i thought i could wear it around my neck loosely and pull it up when needed not that simple due to its tightness some stretch but not enough to be worn comfortable,0
perfect color well made,2
nice soft sweater and gorgeous plum color havent worn or washed it yet to see how it will hold up the sizing is a little off im 52 and 114lbs and ordered the recommended small its huge will keep it anyway for layering,2
see through and big and made very square fabric sucks,0
fit as expected,2
buy a size larger,0
way to small for my nose had to go to the mall to get a right fitted one,0
i bought these gloves because my warmest knit ones are not water resistant these are but do not keep my fingers warm in the cold winter temperatures here in buffalo they are a little stiff so i have to remove them to unfasten my dogs leash or do anything that requires dexterity,1
it keeps me warm all the winter season and it is water proof so i used it with no need to use the umbrelia,2
a beautiful sparkly bracelet but the color is not in the pink family it is more of a copper color,2
only comes with one shirt not a set as described,0
loved the color and the size is perfect for your phone keys and a lipstick,2
i love this pendant it is an exact copy of a diamond accent pendant my mom gave me for xmas when i was 13 i am very happy with this pendant and i wear it every day,2
these were a gift for my husband and he loves them he loves pajamas but is always lamenting the unyealding fabric he loves the fact that these are like a luxurious jersey and hardly takes them off the only word of warning i will give is that the luxurious fabric can be a little revieling in the light grey,2
only needed for a halloween costum so it fit the bill for the price material is thin and i dont see washing well if you wanted to wear it over time,1
there is now draw string there are no pockets the shorts themselves seem to be made out of cheaper material and are too tight around the thighs and i dont have large things all in all these shorts are terrible maybe if you want pants that have no pockets and are uncomfortable you might like them i returned them,0
i had this dress on my wish list for a while but i was hesitant i was afraid that the lace would be cheap and thin and itchy but i am so happy i got it it is of good quality very nice and it fits perfectly,2
muy buena calidad y diseño pero parece una talla menosbr hay que elegir una talla más arriba,1
the screwy laces let my feet swim around in them with my toes banging into the front of them,0
i like it but be warned the mask might be upside down from where the bendy part is,1
if your kiddo has thick glasses these wont work its hard to get them on the glasses even though it say thick glasses are okay,1
i liked the design and the inscription my only concern is the knot holding it together keeps coming loose so i worry about losing it i wish it had another closure,2
the watch was a little too manly for me i have a small wrist so this was a little overwhelming and not very feminine,1
doesnt do what it claims,0
great product i really like the magnifying lens on the glasses,2
i bought this dress because it is reversible and you have two different outfits for travel very soft and comfortable i bought xl for my 52 150 lb frame the fit is perfect,2
runs big its itchy,1
this dress is very cute attended a superheroes party and the little one looked fabulous in it true to size cape was a cute touch with the dress,2
overall its a decent hatbr ordered a couple at different timesbr one had stitching defects on the inside construction though this shouldnt effect the hat itself from coming apart or something just annoying reallybr the other hat arrived with literal dirt all over it had a lot of strings hanging off and some extra stitching that needed to be removed after i ran it thru the washer it seemed to retain its navy color nicely and nothing fell apartcame undonebr the hats are not stiff and make a good low profile cap it fit my bigger head just finebr the main complaint would be the obvious quality control but i understand they are 67 so,1
i did i really tried to like these but they are not at all comfortable the adjustable bands rub the top of my foot and no matter how i adjust them the end up rubbing to the point that the top of my foot is sorechaffed im sure they might be okay for some feet not mine,0
ok shoe very soft flexible and light feels cheap and only good for walking to soft and not enought support for running not digging the look either looks and feels like a shoe for an elderly person,1
this is really a great price and large amount of gloves they hold up well but we throw them away after working in grease,2
it fit very large the buttons go up very high and it is very matronly i felt like a nun,1
overall the product is okay hence the 3 star rating it came quick in perfect condition and as per all the other reviews i sized up two sizes and it fit fine the reason im giving it a 3 rating is because the quality is pretty cheap i can see some of the stitching and over all the legging are pretty thin they are still a good pair or dva leggings though so if your strapped for cash and cant get the official blizzard ones which i would recommend you get over any other pairs you see online because they are the official and original once then these are a good substitute i can see hem lasting a few wears and then maybe not lasting very long im actually going to return my pair and just get the ones from blizzard if you have read any other reviews you will know to size up one or two sizes when getting this pair,1
strings across chest are not straight,1
returned because they were super uncomfortable the color is great though no padding at all,2
very nice and warm,2
these are super cute i bought them for my girls but they are really small small like a nickel or penny i thought it would of been a little bigger,0
great comfort,2
fell apart during first use,0
received package ocean box was ripped completely on the right and the dolphin sleeve and bracelet was missing from the collectionbr got to send it back,0
pretty necklace but i ordered it in gold and it came in silver gave it to my daughterinlaw and she liked it,1
great fit,2
wore once they fell apart the quality sucks its not thick it doesnt hold in your tummy not happy will be returning,0
reviewed by my wife this layered necklace is so pretty it is sparkly delicate and dainty i got the ferris wheel design with the little gold circles with tiny faux diamonds the ferris wheels are beautiful the necklace is very versatile it can be worn with a casual outfit or a dressy outfit the necklace comes very nicely packaged making it nice to give as a giftbr br unfortunately when i wear this necklace i find myself having to constantly adjusting it because the two layers tend to twist and tangle the wrong way this is a bit distracting,1
first its not 100 cotton its a weird poly rayon spandex shiny material and irregularly cut immediately no,0
decent,1
underwear fits as expected but its high on the hip like high waisted underwear or granny panties wont buy again but otherwise fits fine,1
i have this in stone purple it is an attractive bracelet looks nice alone or paired with other wrist wear primarily comprised of flat black lava beads it has 5 deep purple turquoise beads in the center flanked by a metal ring and a multi faceted black bead overall look is low keybr br unisex though the sizing leans more masculine which works in my favor i have wide hands 4 wide palms and large wrists 7 this fits easily over my hand and fits nicely on my wrist with a little space left over has a slight dangle doesnt strangle my wrist i was concerned that this would be a small bracelet that would be stretched to the max and i would end up seeing the elastic nope it is generously sizedbr br probably best for larger body frames might be too loose for smaller body frames with so many products of this nature being geared toward girls teens woman ie very small size it is really nice to see an option for larger body framesbr br add essential oil straight to one or more beads or mix with carrier oil then apply to one or more beads dont wear in shower says not to wear to bed but i do i have been wearing this every day and night for a week so far so good if anything happens in a short time i will be back to updatebr br update and i am back to update as within a couple of days of my original review the bracelet broke the elastic let go and i had beads everywhere the elastic needs to be better or a different bead holder needs to be used i kept the beads to maybe string them onto something else but i doubt i will,1
shorts already have a tear after 1 wear along crotch seam so its not from catching on something shirt seems decent wider then usual for this size but works son loves the thomas shirt so thats a win,1
straps were fine the reviews said to go a size up and i did that caused blisters,1
while i liked the look and feel of the sippers they just felt too squishy for me when i walked through our house which also has padded carpet they might work better for someone who has a lot of hardwood or similar floors returned for credit,1
the pants are cheap and almost see through not impressed,1
gorgeous,2
good product good fabric poor sizingbr really wanted to love it followed the sizing chart and ordered a large but the length is too long,1
these are not 34true to size34 as expected they were at least 1 size too small when i ordered my regular size they are very stiff as well you can tell from afar that they are synthetic i know you get what you pay for and that is true with this shoe i will say they are cute in design but without the quality i didnt exchange them just returned them,0
i am giving it 2 stars because the price is cheap and if you need a cute dress for a costume this may work in a pinch however there was weird stitching in the inside back of the dress running perpendicular to the zipper it was about 4 inches of loose thread stitched this way over a good portion of the zipper this caused the zipper to frequently get stuck there were also loose threads everywhere on other parts of the dress i am returning,0
great scrub top prob best ive owned,2
too small not a typical usa xl i followed the sizing chart and went with the xl these are very small and also short in length had to return also zippers seem like they wont last too long,0
you get what you pay for so cheap looking and manufactured took forever to arrive luckily it was inexpensive would cost to much to send it back into the garbage for this one also wont be using this dealer again,0
great pant,2
probably amazons error not the manufacturer but it came completely wrinkled and a mess was not even wrapped in anything to protect it just stuck in the shipping box in with other items and knocked around have to send it back,0
this is my third time buying this belt and this third time it is much lighter weight and thinner in thickness they have attempted to make the belt look very similar to the older ones shape wise but quality is down and its a cheaper belt holding both side by side it is clear one is of a lower quality,1
very well made and the green plaid design inside is gorgeous material is high quality and zippers are strong and secure lots of pockets everywhere great vibrant orange color my 6 year old looks great in it the deep orange compliments his navy blue braided winter hat well,2
good scarf for the price,2
totally ruined my belly button i got a horrible infection despite cleaningbr it there or more times a day,0
i hadnt even put the whole thing on i tried i really did the stretchiness of whatever is keeping those beads together is either littletonone with durability or for significantly smaller hands if thats the case then the only hands this could probably fit on are a childsbr i tried putting it on first the wrist then the thumb then the index finger but of course said index finger immediately snaps beads flying everywhere then when i eventually try taking it off the thumb snaps too sending more beads flyingbr i plan to fix it on my own later using a more durable materialbr and from what ive read on other reviews apparently managing to get it on isnt even worth it as even so small as a twelve year olds hands are too big for it your hands need to practically already be bones for this to fit i gather,0
nice ring but sizing is off cant wear it way too big,1
i would order size bigger that what u need too snug under the arms,1
shirt arrived with no buttons and looked as if the stitching was put on backwards,0
cute,1
first impression nice looking shirt i washed in cold water no dryer and it shrunk definitely not cotton although the care tag says 100 cotton good thing the shirt is oversized or i wouldnt have been able to wear even once the size small i bought i wouldnt recommend this shirt,1
lights doesnt work,0
the dress is a little bit different from tbe picture,0
i ordered this in my size and it came way to small,0
love these belts the quality is amazing and the prices even better shipping was fast too,2
looks cheaply made and too small,1
i checked the sizing chart before ordering had ordered a 2xl or 3xl it came in more like an xs ended up giving it to my mother a few years ago,0
these make wonderful gifts durable comfortable and great choices in style,2
i have tried all the brands but if you are looking for more of an athletic compression sock these are the best i was skeptical because of the price but dont be fooledthey are awesome i plan on buying more,2
not the best quality but it does the job it is comfortable lightweight and true to size it looks like polyester its fair so 3 stars,1
this jacket is so ugly material so horrible,0
my husband is a mechanic and prefers these shirts over other brands that he has tried we will be purchasing this brand from now on,2
i ordered the wrong size to begin with but even large seamed way to small possible this review may be unfair to an extent felt as there is too much material that works against each other looks better in pictures than it is sending them back so i didnt test water resistance,0
nice shirt,2
this is not slim fit it is regular fit,2
im returning it,1
i purchased three pants two size 2x and one size 1x the 1x was entirely too tight and short while the 2x was also too tight i returned all 3 pairs in exchange for a size 3x because i liked them that much again they run very small,0
i wrote a review when i received these socks saying that they seemed to be of excellent quality but were too small with a 165 calf circumference i figured id need a widecalf size but the specifications for the item didnt off that information so i ordered a size up and hoped i couldnt even get it over my foot the company contacted me offering to send me a larger size which they did but unfortunately it still didnt fit i appreciate their responsiveness to my problem i didnt ask to return the purchase because id tried it on barefoot so they were responding to my review looking over other reviews it seems that fitting all shapes and sizes is challenging and i encourage this company and all compression sock manufacturers to list a suggested calf circumference range for each size,1
they just arrived they seem fine to me my skin has not been exposed to the south texas sun for years but my friend says ive got to have a bathing suit for a cruise i normally wear an 8 but these 10s seem fine they are almost to my knee and are of nice fabric and well made i will wear them under protest but they seem okay not my thing to be half naked in the sunoh well,2
im a tall woman 5934 but this robe doesnt even cover my rear end it fits like a long shirt if you are short this might be long enough unfortunately my husband bought it ahead of time for my birthday but by the time i opened it i was past the return date,0
you cant go wrong with this hat if your kid likes minecraft,2
when i first got this shirt i loved it so much i bought another color right away unfortunately after about 2 or 3 washes the white part of the shirt starting pilling the colored and striped fabrics were fine so its a real shame the white part was such bad quality would not buy again,1
this was a gift for my daughterwho lives in pa it gets cold there and the irish knot is tight the intricate design is beautiful she loves it it is an absolutely perfect sweater for people who live where it gets really cold i actually visited their store during a recent trip to ireland it was no more expensive ordering through amazon and i didnt have to carry a bulky item onto the plane the delivery was faster than indicated and it was sent to a rural area great purchase and a quality product,2
watch size is huge can links be taken out to fit my wrist,1
i am 61 180 lbs slim but sturdy and the xxl is perfect on me no riding up at the crotch at all its tempting to keep these simply for that reason because sometimes finding the right fit in onepieces is difficult and they are quite cozy unfortunately i was expecting the nordic snowflake navy pattern to be two shades of blue instead of blue on a black background black just isnt what i wanted as for the quality perhaps a little better than you might expect for something 30 i do have a feeling it wouldnt hold up very well after a winter of consistent wearing and laundering which is another reason im returning ill keep looking again the fit was perfect and they looked pretty adorable on if i do say so myself so if you want cozy and lightweight are okay with medium quality and dont mind the black these might be perfect for you,1
no it isnt the shade depicted it is a nice blue shade and make sure you watch a video on how to use it before you use it,2
very nice elegant and exquisite looking,2
bought this keychain for my son who is an apex legends fan it broke within one day not worth the money,0
returned this to get the look the model has you would need to order an xxxl this shirt looked terrible on and i am 59 160 lbs,0
very nice quality especially for the price aesthetically pleasing feel durable and like they are of high quality materials and come with many nice accessories a case cleaning towel screwdriver for adjustments etc nicest sunglasses ive ever seen for this price,2
i have worn them a handful of times already they are super soft super comfy very flattering and hold up well in the wash they look the same on the fifth wear as they did on the first its all the comfort of wearing leggings without looking like you just left yoga i would buy them again and again,2
i ordered women 69 my shoe size is 859 the sock is malformed does not look like a sock i wanted wool because my feet get very cold in winter due to raynauds disease my feet felt warm but the sock was bunched together not happy,0
great jacket definitely as warm as down yet very light theres a few downsides to the design pockets are located too low and allow wind to sneak in while in use because they affect the waistline the zipper is actually located on the left hand side so not american fashion friendly lastly they sell giga7 models which are last years model for the full price of the newest model giga8 i know this because i have also purchased a new jacket from the manufacturer which is a giga8 at the same exact price,1
i havent worn them all day yet but ive worn them several hours at a time and theyre very comfortable i got them well in advance of a planned trip to scotland so id have ample time to wear them in i dont think theyre going to give me any trouble at all im glad theyre a little roomy as i can wear different weight socks depending on the temperature they can be tied tight enough that my foot doesnt slip as i was afraid it would as i have a fairly narrow heel and often have that problem with shoes im very well pleased with these boots,2
these dont even come close to being similar to the other pants of this brand i have disappointing to say the least,0
pretty,0
very flattering fits comfortably and easy care,2
expected more from the product cant play music,1
i use these to lounge around the house and sleep in at night i never wake up sweaty in them which is a huge plus but i dont get unduly cold wearing them around the house either theyre still not my favorite sleep shirts because they dont slide well across my cotton sheets and i always have to untwist them after i roll over but none of that is really their intended purpose so im still giving them 5 starsbr br if anybody knows the perfect sleep shirt that breathes as well as these hugs the torso without constricting and slides like satin across sheets without twisting please comment on this review,2
this dress is amazing so sexy and comfortable buying in other colors,2
my wife loves these so much she ordered another pair in a different color just as good as betabrand that cost twice as much,2
i love the fact the scarves come prewrapped and comfortable,2
just received these these socks are definitely not appropriate for any kind of athletic activity except maybe casual and slow walking they are way too thin think light dress sock there is no padding anywhere i guess they are breathable because there is no way any moisture could get trapped if i tried to use these for tennis for example i would have blisters in one set and they would probably be worn out after one match if they removed the word athletic from the description they would be fine,0
these are terrible the cheapest sunglasses ive ever seen gas station sunglasses are 100x better than these the picture makes them look ok but please dont buy these you are wasting 10,0
comfortable fit i got the yellow ones they were quite sheer i might have a larger posterior than most chicks bit i swear i took my measurements,1
these earrings are the cutest im just super disappointed in the packaging because almost half of them are damaged and i dont know how to fix them the threads in the tassels arent laying right because of how they were packaged luckily ill be able to wear about five pairs of them but the others are so wacky looking and of course the red ones are the ones i was wanting most and they are the worst of all,1
did not fit right sizing was inconsistent with other styles from same brand,1
its a hat,1
great quality great design,2
pretty thin i dont expect them to last long i just wear them around the house,1
ive tried many different fabric headbands from a variety of manufacturers so i think i have a pretty good idea of the range of whats available and how these things are made ive got to say that this one isnt all that great compared to some others the fabric doesnt have enough stretch to use for a headband this thick so if youve got a large head it will squeeze uncomfortably its also bulky comparatively speaking i think the problem isnt so much in the design as it is in the choice of material something thinner and stretchier is definitely neededbr i received a discount in exchange for an honest review,1
on the plus side the fabric is a soft stretchy cotton knit in pretty floral prints the colors are exactly as shown and they are all made out of the same type of fabric on the minus side they are a bit small for my 2234 average size head and they do slip off i have to use bobby pins to keep it in place on my head im hoping they will stretch out a bit with use,1
to small,0
socks fall apart on frist day of whereing them,0
size was off by a whole size other than that they look ok,1
i simple love these,2
i ordered black its brown and not even close to as cute in person as in picture going back,0
wonderful,2
well the reviews were rightbr br i have a smaller head 2234 diameter and also wear glasses so i thought i would give this a try no go even with my smaller head it only took about 20 minutes for me to feel the pressure if only it were a little less 34round34 it would be the perfect visor i wonder why no one has made an adjustable visor another day i guessbr br im giving this 3 very solid stars for 1 it looks really great and the bill is just the right length to shade the sun and not look ridiculous and 2 the price is really fantastic and 3 its a good style overall to not conflict with my glasses frames and still stay onbr br the search continues,1
very thin material hou can i send it back,0
it was real leather but the size was larger than it claimed,1
super lindo,2
perfect,2
the package was horrible as well the jewellery looked so old and cheap quality the product is not worth even 2 made out of cheap qualityplease dont buy,0
the fabric was nice but the shirt was tight through the waist too small,0
horrible quality didnt even fit waste of money,0
the beads were a little smaller than i imagined from the picture but thats good because it makes it more easy to carry around the beads look and feel nice i am a satisfied customer especially at under 2,2
these frames are not very sturdy they almost look and feel like childrens frames i am highly disappointed,1
made for a child i guess,0
i picked a pack of these up thinking that calvin klein has been around so these might be good they are over priced fruit of the looms the cotton feels more like cardboard half way through a hot working day they stretch out a get loose search for some david archy bamboo they come in a 4 pk for like 27 and are super soft and light,0
so l needed sunglasses and now l have them ty,2
love it so girlie just as pictured,2
im loving my coffee shirt its so comfortable,2
needs a separate loop one for the luggage and one for the handle as its designed it gets propped into angles that make pulling my bag less comfortable than not having it at all would be great if it spun 360º as well i have a different one that does that but its sadly no longer made,0
i thought i would like it but when i tried it on i didnt might be ok for you,1
the red was more maroon they are really soft small fit i wear a medium in surgical gloves and these do not fit well they hurt and cut off circulation and the joints of the glove fingers are too high up,1
very good quality hat colors are really nice looks like the sellers image very satisfied,2
this was ordered for my ex wifes daughter and she was very pleased with them,2
it was a gift for deployed soldiers through 34soldiers angels i will assume these socks fit well,2
very poor quality they feel very cheap,0
ordered along with several items but wasnt in my order sad because the picture looked awesome,1
your heels slip out so easy to trip and fall ive already broken 3 metatarsals so im taking no chances,1
beautiful piece,2
you get what you paid for,0
nice for kids not quality product to gift an adult,1
this is so much smaller than i had imagined the opening through it is half the size of the charm which really looks bad in my opinion i have not seen it on the bracelet yet i am giving it as a christmas gift to my sister in law who has the bracelet i wish i had the time to send it back for something else but unfortunately i dont i sure hope it looks better once its in the chain im really disappointed especially for the price meh,0
too heavy with too short of a post good luck getting the tiny ball on,1
this quickly became my favorite sleep shirt its soft a good length and cut narrow enough to not have lots of extra fabric twisting around me when i turn,2
small and cheap material,0
easy to installed kind of compatible but never stay on clips keep open during wear my fit fell and broke the screen maybe mine was defective,0
my granddaughter enjoyed it i wish id order one size bigger its hard to figure out the size,2
damaged upon receipt poor quality,0
the fit is small way smaller than expected one wash and they shrank even more they are overly thick so make sure you have plenty of room in your shoes my slippers are a half size too big and with these socks on they felt snug,0
i love wearing keens love their style i had the older version of this shoe and i was hoping to find the sameone i didnt so this one is the newer version its bigger wider than my old one not sure that i like it,1
on the fence about this jacket it doesnt feel like a trash bag as another reviewer said has a silky polyester silk feel to it very light and not as puffy as i thought on the thinner side i am 130lbs 59 and got the large hits right at the hip but would not be able to wear bulky sweaters underneath and with that dont think it will be too warm hood is not insulated more of a wind breaker and inner pockets dont have a lining either so maybe uncomfortable to keep too much in the inner pockets,1
way to big i ordered the size i wear and they were huge not even something id be able to just wear around the house quite disappointed because they are pretty but no use to me,0
i love this item it is made well and looks good has held up well so far,2
ugly pin for a disgusting campaign,0
i loved this time piece absolutely gorgeous to look at the dial is large but not as large as some of the other stuhrling watches that ive purchased the difference is negligible a few millimeters is all but you can tell when sitting side by side the colors accentuate each other nicely and the band looks good i really like the dual time on the watch and how they trade off roman numerals and english numbers the open heart design is neat but is somewhat hidden by the center connection piece overall this watch is great you wont be disappointed they even sent me the watch with the correct time as i opened the package wonderful,2
ok not great,1
do not buy this dress unless you jave have no boobs i cant even wear this without a bra on the fabric is thin and cheap as well the only thing i like are the wings and its pointless because i cant even zip the dress over my boobs,0
i did not like the way it tied in the back it could not stay down and flat to the body like i had hoped cute top though needs a certain length of pants to make it fit right,1
i love these theyre very comfortable and stylish my only complaint is that whatever dye they used to make the inside yellow will ruin any white or light colored socks you wear with them even after 6 months of almost daily wear,2
cute but cheep you get what you pay for,0
first be aware that like all these items made in asia that includes the patterns they are made from the fit is slightly off for the western woman arms are a bit tight compared to the larger sizes and the measurements are always offnever as long as stated or as wide thats just the way it is they keep thinking the petite stature of asian women which is totally not the western female standard i bought this my usual size and it fits but absolutely not oversized arms were tight as i expected but i can stretch them a bit so it is comfy on the cardigan the buttonholes are not finished in any way just a small slit without finishing the edges super cheap construction and way overpriced its the graphics that make these and i love that so i am keeping it but i will finish off the buttonholes and probably buy a pullover if the price goes down,1
they appear to be well made and fit snuglya little too dark on the tint for me otherwise fine,1
this dress is a perfect little black dress its soft and fits true to size i love the dress the only problem is that its see thru i had to purchase a slip to go under because in the sun you can see everything,2
material thinner than i expected but very confortable,2
the body torso is fine the sleeves are short however i have averagelong armsbr its a thin material not very soft but nothing to complain about thoughbr its nice nothing to write home about though,1
excellent product,2
beautiful necklace looking forward to wearing it for the first time nice chain,2
i like this necklace as the color is good and strong it is a little chunky but will go well with my navy sweater,2
i liked the material but it kept falling down my arm while i was wearing them i had to fuss with them all day good sun protection,1
these are a weird fit read reviews bought larger size and the hips are huge while the and legs are small i have an average height and body shape 55 and 140 lbs dont waste your money,1
this is a beautiful belt crafted for years of wearbr br would make a thoughtful useful gift,2
most comfy sneakers ever easy slip on style looks great,2
i found the botice to be too short the fabric is beautiful,1
100 cotton great fit good quality snaps great pastel colors,2
a little big and gaudy didnt wear it for long maybe one month decent didnt cause any irritation and didnt break,1
looks pretty but the bar was not curved ill have to try to bend it but i didnt have high expectations for 3,0
its a cute and convenient bag,2
this hat was a big disappointment the actual hat was great when it was mailed it was folded and consequently changed the look of the hat i would suggest changing the method of transport i was going to give it as a gift which i was going to decorate now i will give it to my grandchild to play dress up,0
they run small so get the next larger size and it will fit perfectly i ordered five more,2
the top is fine for an extra summer shirt i am 5 9 and it comes to just at the top of my hips there is no way its a tunic or hangs down over my pants i will wear it around the house its very casual and reminds me of the apron tops my mil used to wear soft fabrics and i line dried them,1
purse is exactly as advertised arrived on time and looks great,2
to cute but way to small it was a gift for my daughter who is a size small or xsmall got her the small and it was to small around the area where the arm meets the shoulder arm length was perfect bodice was a little snug as well it was returned,0
not as described item is not 22g and ringstuds are much much bigger then pictured i cant use these l hook is too long and is visible inside nostril when worn,0
i bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it she said it looked magical i liked that she could put it over her head and not have to undo it,2
the hat arrived covered in cat hair i am allergic to cats i spent 10 minutes picking hairs out and gave up there were several human hairs too this is just plain gross ill continue cleaning it later i want to keep it because this is the only one i found with a front and back light,0
5 stars for how cute it is but 1 star for how small it was i ordered an xxl after reading the reviews normally wear a large and it was very tight so sad,1
love the t but its short and i am short waisted,1
ordered this suit for my daughter 19 in a med it is awesome the color is the perfect blue great material and doesnt fit to small on butt,2
liked it very comfortable and stylish,2
its a bit boxy not as long as id like barely covers hip not sure if ill keep for 39 it should be better quality,1
best quality and service,2
returning it,0
this is big bulky gawdy awful and ugly it looks like a ten cent item from a gumball machine i do not recommend wasting your money,0
we love these crocs our daughter loves to wear them with or without socks and raves about how comfortable they are,2
just too thin and flimsy wont stay on glasses cheap but still not worth it,0
not liking the fit,1
the product is very thinly made it is about ankle length but its see through your able to see anything you place underneath i gave it 2 stars because its not a bad looking skirt,0
didnt like,0
cant wear as studs are bent flat cant wear them sorry,0
this shirt was thin material and ran way small more like a womens or junior size,1
little hard to put on,1
plenty of growing room for my 11yr old,2
had several pairs come apart after a single wear and wash not happy,0
awesome nostalgic thing from 80s,2
some of the socks came broken and they did not last but one wear sad,0
a tad bit smaller than id hoped and def needs some ironing thank u,0
nice comfie soft but is definitely see through,1
has good arch support,2
case fell apart after just a lil while not worth the money,0
this product was very disappointing but you get what you pay for it was cheap,0
super cheap looking and poorly made it looks like it was printed off an old printer running out of ink and then badly ironed on,0
not right size crappy quality not quite ready to buy clothes online at this point,0
such a bummer i wore these one and washed them and the seam threads are coming apart i own a black pair of the high waist leggings and dont have any issues pretty disappointed with these,0
loose fit and feel this is soft with a stretchable comfort ordered in blue mist it almost appears dirty the dyed blue fabric is pretty blue but where its colorless its not white more of a cream or oat color that makes it appears dinghy even though its notbr br textured fabric is a unique touch the fit is solid in everything but the length ordered xl for chest size as i usually wear lxl 52 147lb 38cbr depending on bust this will shorten overall length in the front for myselfbuild top was too cropped for my liking drop length is 20 so be aware if this is something you prefer or notbr br for the price point of 16 top is sewn with straight seams and no loose threads soft but unique fabric texture and mix nothing wrong overall just nothing about it is really right or a wow for me hoping info can help make your decision stay safe everyone,1
cute bracelet but its a little lower quality than i expected,1
these are just not good boots not made of true leather im not sure what they are made of hard to get on my foot too,0
these socks are impressively thin they have a little gripper line at the heel to keep them from completely disappearing into the abyss of my sneaker other than that these sucks are just meh they cut my 775 foot right across the top of my arch which is basically torture in running shoes ive yet to find any of the socks after washing them so pretty sure theyre a singlewear item ill wash future pairs in a garment bagbr tldr very thin socks that cut the top of the foot and disappear in the wash,1
first these are not jeans these are thick jean shaped leggings that being said they are comfortable but a bit longer than standard jeans or pants for the price its worth hemming them,1
the neck was huge and the arms too tight the material was delightfully soft but thin even in the photo on the website you can see the model is wearing a camisole because the material is so super thin sadly the top is already on its way back but i havent given up on the company or the material i just need a smaller neck hole short sleeves and the requisite camisole to make it all work or a really nice infinity scarf to make it less obviously thin as i said the material is wonderfully soft how it would launder is another matter but silky soft goes a long way with me so if you have enviously thin arms and look great in a boat neck you will be thrilled to know it totally covers your bum which was why i was buying it in the first place to go with leggings would be a great look,1
this is a well made item but this particular is deceivingit is more of a rust brown than the color they show,1
bought that red plaid style very soft warm and durable for our vermont winters id buy againgreat value,2
awesome,2
reviews said runs small i wear a 12 so ordered a 13 i could not even get my foot in it very disappointed in product,0
love this shirt the deep sapphire color and design are beautiful and well done the way they create the color and pattern and shadowing effect makes the shirt appear almost sueded or velvety beautiful there are lots of comments about sizing issues i got the xl laid flat and buttoned up and measured underarm to underarm across the front the shirt measures 265 which gives a total chest of 53 inches for the xl from top of shoulder to bottom of hem the shirt measures 30 inches in length hope these measurements help the size chart reflects different measurements a shirt not too light nor too heavy on the material great unique shirt for the price,2
really impressed with this scarf pure white no marks it can be worn multiple ways its literally a tube of fabric which honestly took me a sec to figure out i might get a couple more i also bought black and its excellent as well,2
love thwm,2
my husband and i loves calvin hobbs buy one size larger,2
lovely little summer blouse just a little large so will stitch in sides just a bit love the lace,2
this fit perfectly and appears to be well made i love the color too very happy with this purchase,2
bracelets are beautiful however they were too large for my wrists seller was very nice to deal with and gladly accepted my return they will work fine if you have larger wrists i would have given 5 stars but i couldnt wear them,1
im a 16 but i like comfort so i ordered 18 they fit and stretch everywhere but the waist there is absolutely no stretch in the waist and im not thick in that area but theyre so tight and unwearable i would have returned them but the nearest location isnt at all convenient,1
if you have large boobs do not buy once i tried it on it didnt look the way i expected and my boobs were too big i have 36dd36ddd boobs for reference,1
these didnt even last one flight,0
my wife really likes the beanie,2
not worth it at all very constricting so sent back,0
but seller made it right my son wears medium on 90 of his stuff but this looks like a kids med not adult size,1
good value good looking pattern,2
the comments said these are sized small so i ordered a 9 15 i wear an 8 15 or a 9 medium to wide these came with size 41 9 5 on the label but they fit more like a 7 12 to an 8 the width is fine the quality for the price is great really cute and i am really disappointed that i am having to return them,1
not a helmet its a mask fits my 4 year old well but i can tell its not going to last very long also had weird black marks on it that did come off after scrubbing them but still kind of annoying,1
prettier than the picture,2
beautiful starry night projection for my little nieces bedroom 3 yrs the whole family loves it,2
beautiful bluegray color perfect size for everyday fits larger wallet phone i purchased to carry for a wedding and know it will get much use beyond that event,2
these jeans does not have the 86 front like they say i have ordered many livis from here but different nane and these do not fit they are to smalli will to returning them,0
it looks very pretty on hiding body flaws behind the posterior thighs and my little tummy tankis look best on me i bought the purple one and the color was vibrant the blackgrey would probably look good on me too but i wanted something more colorful this time my husband noticed and thought i looked really good,2
this fit my one year old for his first birthday but would not fit my almost 3 year old its good quality and adorable but just be aware its on the small side,2
muy bonito para un regalo o detalle lo recomiendo 100,2
my husband lives in this boxers,2
strap was lousy got caught in hair constantly,2
the material is cheaply made do not waste your money,0
my husband has not yet worn it but has tried it on and it fits well he has a large dome so very happy we found something stylish that fits,2
they look good and look great on her,2
i really like these sunglasses i used to find them in stores but now must rely on internet ordering when they were available in the store i could always ascertain that white was indeed white the last pair i ordered were not white even though they were so labeled so i had to go through the agony of returning that pairbr i finally decided to roll the dice again and this time they did indeed turn up white as ordered they are stylish they are comfortable and if you enjoy playing roulette or other games of chance you might get lucky on the color right now i am only 5050,1
this jacket is so soft and fluffy the zipper is nice and smooth it comes right about to the hip level it has pockets i absolutely love it so soft and cozy,2
the larger size is very nice size would probably not like the smaller size except for on small children if you want a clean simple no dangle round stud like earring this is it but with an added touch of elegance from the sparkle and shine and bit more complexity of the design very neat and unique appearance goes casual to dressy or anything in between nice variety of colors,2
these make nice house slippers except for the fact they are so loud when walking,1
great fabric,2
the sleeves are too big they need to be smaller and more fitted to modern design,0
well made shirts with soft and thicker material i was surprised at how well the shirt fit me quality is superb i think i will get more in other colors i have the gray and dark green noticed that the gray has bigger arm holes than green i like the way that one fits me slightly better but they are both awesome and flatter people with wide shoulders like myself i am normally a size medium and medium fit perfectly for me i am 57 36b bra 30 waist 42 shoulders 140lb athletic built,2
thinner than i thought theyd be,1
lots of material pretty but looks like a mumu on,1
cheeeeeeaaaap made with tiny screws dont waste your money,0
the product has factory defects poor finish and does not match the advertisement,0
i really like this item i love to pull it on and go the scratch is very forgiving i took off a couple of stars because the shorts on the inside dont stay down very well otherwise i did buy a couple of them,1
the deal was real but you get what you pay for i went quantity over qualitybr lesson learned,0
i ordered an xl for a friend as a gift but i was expecting it to be long it looked a bit short and it was not as big as i thought it would be the image on the shirt looked poor it didnt look like a high quality printbr i might return it,1
im pretty small and i looked all over for a plaid skirt that wouldnt be huge and long on me it took me a month to settle on t his oneand its much bigger than the pictures and sizing guide imply too bad,1
could tell immediately upon opening that this was not a good quality purse the zipper on the front pocket was off track and the pu leather is really cheap looking the interior design is also very odd as its just one big pocket with a smaller pocket flap in the middlebr also its smaller than the picture shows pay attention to the actual specsbr the only thing that met my expectations was the color,0
the pockets are great after wearing this twice i just came back here to buy two more,2
comfy flops,2
i wear an 8 or 10 and these size 10 fit fine slightly baggy before washing i am returning them because they are not nearly as well made as the lee iconic fit jeans i ordered also call me crazy i grew up in the 5060s and i just dont like jeans that are black inside wtf why not as real a denim as possible,1
around the arms and under one arm after only a few wears started to tear,1
nice looking mask good quality but the size was smaller than expected the fit was a bit tight on the head and the jaw line seemed small to me other than that nice purchase would buy again for a child or teen,1
i purchased this product for my friends seems they it came a bit smaller than expected but to be on fair side i am not the right to rate it,1
very warm i love these boots,2
color fades after a while and hard to clasp,1
its to narrowi had to cut the lacing to put it onim not satisfied these bootsfor such high price it should be betteri have several uggscheaper and more comfortable,1
comfortable attractive colors warm but not too bulky winter socks i worried they might feel itchy but they are very cozy and not scratchy at all,2
it didnt clean my ring like i was expecting it kind of didnt even look like it did anything,1
great product,2
must have for any crazy cat mom my go to purse for the last few months perfect size for a small wallet phone sunglasses and some other small items,2
they just dont fit and they really do look like yoga pants not dress pants,0
very pretty very well made although im not feeling the middle sash overall nice dress,1
these are very slippery socks they dont go well with my current shoes,1
it had a really weird shape and i was not a fan of the movement of the farmer while it was on,1
beautiful trendy and light weight,2
this soft exquisitely comforting dress is meant to fit like a cloud floating around you and it does the fabric is a thick light cotton mesh that feels wonderful next to your skin it is the most comfortable dress ive ever worn i suspect youd want a slip under it for outdoor wear but as a house dress it is my favorite garment ever,2
this looked so cute when i took it out of the package but after i washed and dried it it became very wrinkled the sleeves are shorter than they appear in the picture and it felt more like a sleeveless nightgown not a fan,0
love the fully adjustable band and has held up well so far,2
good thick socks,2
beautiful swimsuit but sadly too small size seems to run on the small side,1
i use it every day i keep it in my briefcase when i switch bags i just have to take the grid it out and transfer and i have all my necessities with me,2
comfortable hat flexfit is not uncomfortable like it is with some hats,2
material is both beautiful and well made the pictures dont do justice to what the item actually looks like,2
very very smalltight i have a normal size head and shape for a woman this does not sit well on my head it looks like good quality and color is as pictured on the webpage,0
i have to wear orthotics in most of my shoes but not these great arches and support all over but quite klunky lookingbr br the two real problems are that my long toes are at the very end but the arch support would be in the wrong place in a larger size good thing i bought these for running errands since there is no way i could wear hiking weight socks i either go sock free or wear really thin socalled trouser socks this is a familiar problem and why i wear sandals most of the year good thing i live in azbr br the other problem is that the shoes are too bulky to wear with straightleg pants the bottom bunches over the shoe instead of having a break leggings or thin legged jeans are fine,2
lovely jeans but you need to be taller than 5ft 3 bought for trip to spain needed to take 4 inches from bottom which would take flare away,0
im old school trifold wallet that being said i finally decided to find a front pocket slash back pocket slim wallet found this one all i have to say is awesome very pleased favorite wallet hands down put in my favorites to buy later when need to thanks for the awesome product sherman brands knocked it out of the parkbr recommend to anyone looking for a slim walletbr 8082022,2
good quality prodcut and good service recommend for those that travel they really help stay organized,2
this green antifade umbrella replacement cover appears to be doing the job it fit perfectly and there has been no fade especially in this central texas sun we are very happy with this product and strongly recommends it others,2
i bought these for my cousin who had lost her mother my aunt this year my aunt loved hummingbirds and my cousin had just gotten a hummingbird tattoo in memory of her mom these were the perfect gift theyre small and adorable she absolutely loved them,2
these boots run very small and are hard to put on,1
top is cute but sizing is not clear in description,0
cute dress fits nicely great color but quality was not as good you can see through the dress will need slip,1
item as described and packaged exceptionally prime so delivery was fastbr would definitely do business again,2
first of all when we took them out of the package they felt very cheap the plastic is light and there were obvious mold marks on the edges after watching a few videos and reading a few articles i am sure they are fake i looked for the handmade in italy marks and they just say made in italy there were seams on the edges of the arms like they were made from a mold the last thing that made me certain were the hinges they are supposed to have five barrels on the hinges and these only have one were very disappointed,0
locket is very cute but the chain is very flimsy and already broke,1
i have other bobs but not this style i should have listened to my daughter when she said order a 12 size bigger i didnt and now i am returning them and getting the correct size i really like them they are cute and lightweight,2
its the length thats the problem if your 60 feet tall n slim its not long enough but otherwise its is a great product just need to have for taller customers,1
i recently bought this polishing cloth and all i can say is that you get what you pay forbr it is large but it is very thin and doesnt have much of the polish in it it works ok and is worth the money im just disappointed and should have spent more money to get a better one,1
way small like newborn sized,0
be sure to read previous reviews not made to last pocket tore after 3rd time wearing other than durability ii love it just needed to give it some extra tlc with the sewing kit,1
i should have ordered one size biggerbr design is not as clear as image advertised,0
way to big ok quality,1
good quality shoes,2
ankle surgery sock kept swelling down,2
looks like the picture held together all day stayed in place didnt flop over decent product you get what you would expect,2
this umbrella is well made easy to carry and use during my visit to stonehenge in england the wind and rain was probably around 2530 mph and the umbrella flipped as noted in the product description then returned to the original position it held up like a champ it is easy and convenient to carry along when shopping sightseeingor any other activity i highly recommend this umbrella,2
cracked down the back after a couple months and then they were useless my boys really use their boots and out them through a lot if play outside they might last longer if not played in hard and just worn for light playwear,0
so happy with my rainbow zebra he is not too small and not to big great detail and lots of color looks just like the picture,2
she loves this anime wears it every day when she washes it she put it right back on hot out the dryer,2
nice light weight cover up,2
picture appears that they are white with pattern they are not they are clear and the sun comes shining through so i returned them,1
cheap quality the shirt looked dingy and faded after one wash cycle would not recommend this item to future buyers,0
was smaller than i expected great quality even though its smaller side,1
i love the fabric i love the design i love the color the sm doesnt meet across the front of my body the sleeves are perfect the lxl has shoulder seams that come halfway down the top of my arms the sleeves are long but can be rolled up on both sizes the length is finebr br i am 54 108 lbs based on the reviews one of the sizes should have worked i love this robe but i need a true medium size or a slightly larger small i returned the sm and am about to return the lxl,1
very happy with this top its a fun print supersoft has a flattering drape and is very comfortable the fit was as expected i ordered two more washes great cold water delicate cycle air fluff in the dryer and hang up to finish drying so no shrinkage looks great with black leggings,2
very upset the pictures started to crack and peel with in two weeks she wont wear it anymore,0
my baby wears 5 and i ordered 6 because i was thinking it would be little bit big but not too much but it was way too big than i was expected it was really loose and heavy love the design i dont know why i didnt noticed that this boot is more expensive than similar products on amazon,1
love everything about it i even ordered more for my girlfriend she loved them and asked me to order 2 for her,2
the shirt fits my son good as others have mentioned however the pants look like girls tights also one of the knee patches is sewed on with yellow thread and the other is back well just use the shirt so it wasnt a complete lost but still a disappointment,0
would not buy again,0
honestly the most comfortable pair of flip flops ive ever worn im usually a size 10 but due to other reviews i ordered a size 11 and its was perfect,2
love it,2
yo me confundi pense que me llegarian de diferentes colores pero me gusto que se adapta a cualquier talla,1
these are so cool very retro and early 80s,2
i find these too thin to wear in public however i do wear them for sleeping as they are soft and comfortable,1
delivery was fine so was the lightweight design of the facemasks i washed these as soon as i got them but was very upset when i saw a lot of black specks and very fine dust that was in the fibers of these facemasks i even rinsed them 2 more times and more black specks and some dust is still coming out going back,0
not4me,1
its ok,1
too big and clunky,1
i love this dress i didnt have any and this was a perfect one to start with i have gotten many compliments on it,2
this was so ugly i had to return it it was tight around my chest and not nearly as cute as the picture length was good,0
too small,0
my wife has owned this wallet for about a year now and she loves it it holds a lot of cards and in the center has a zippered compartment which is perfect for small items and change there are two long areas on each side of the zippered center compartment for bills it is a great size for her larger bags definite win for me since i gave it to her as a gift,2
this was not worth the made really cheap it is loose falls off my wrist all the time next time i drop it i wont pick it up,0
these socks seem to be good quality but they are not comfortable very disappointing since i bout 4 pairs,1
skull heads are upside down and cant change them for the way the vest snaps are,0
these are tiny like i ordered a 4x when i normally wear a 3 or so and they are so small i have them to my sister who is 200 lbs and a size 14 and they fit her just baggy around the legs,1
perfect for the price i didnt need anything fancy,2
good cushion nice socks,2
they fit well are soft and comfortable and warm enough only downside is that the touch screen aspect doesnt work that well,2
i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this watch i ordered the rose gold plated with a black and white band its def my fav work watch that ive ever ordered,2
one of my favorite dresses comfy and stretchy,2
the quality was not as expected,1
unable to use it because it was too heavy which it is impossible to stay on your face and it was too big for my face i did not return it,0
really cute just wish id order a size smaller,1
some of the wholes that makes the belt tighter have already come out,1
i ordered a top but it fits more like a dress its too long for a top i ordered an xl because i assumed since it came from china it would run small it didnt its huge i am 55 and have a voluptuous figure but it hung below my hips like a short dress,1
the glasses are sturdy and work well for night riding,1
i dislike that the chain has turned already,1
well made in the usa the clasp system with the pin really works and i dont need a belt other brands that i have tried would not hold on the waste band so i need to attach a something heavier like a belt much more comfortable with out the belt,2
the center of the packing cube doesnt flatten at all so kinda defeats the purpose,2
i got a medium but i was swimming in it i loved it enough to replace with a small its a beautiful flattering dressbr update after a few wears washes the fabric is pillingfuzzy where my purse and seatbelt rubs against it the other fabric is fine so its cheap but so is the price tag i dont think this was a smart longterm investment but i still love the dress,2
the dress is beautiful but it is tight up top everywhere else it fits perfect but im afraid if i breathe too deep ill rip the dress and im only a c cup i would also deffinetely wash the dress before you try it on my dress had a very strong chemical smell but washing it was enough to fix that,1
too many zippered pockets and confusing to remember where everything went,0
fire all around,2
i love these wearing them all day every day,2
absolutley love the fit and price when i first bought i bought two pairs and between the 2 wore them at least 4 days a week so after a year inner fabric is worn i have curvy thights so they do touch knees also baggy after a year im 5 and 140 lb bought both size 8 and 10 10 was too loose 8 fit great pictures are after almost a year of washing and wearing,1
i like them they were for a school play for my five year old exactly what was needed for the snowman costume good quality,2
no arch support for my husband had to return even though they looked great on him,1
purchased as i wanted pips of higher quality than what came with the uniform costume unfortunately these are far too large they are at least twice the diameter of the screen compared dimensions however they were good quality shine just came in a baggy just wouldnt work for the more accurate look that i was going for,0
it feels really nice runs slightly large but i love oversized sweaters so i dont mind that the pocket is also lined with the faux fur,2
great comfort and its secure,2
greta style bag but the color is more of a dark red rather than wine colored not what i was looking for so returned other than that the bag was fine,1
i was very impressed with the quality and comfort of the leggings i purchased its a little scary sometimes ordering online because in a perfect world im hoping what i order will be exactly what im anticipating well can i just say i was pleasantly surprised with my leggings price comfort fit and best of allall done online with amazon primebr br thanks so much for offering this item i will most definitely reorder leggings depot buttery soft e garibay,2
first of all size up my husband wears a size 12 in shoes but the 1314 in these slippers was just right he loves the style because it keeps the tops of his feet a lot warmer he also likes the velcro closure which allows for a little bit of a customized fit the sole also makes it possible for him to run out to the mailbox without having to change into shoes hope they last because hes really happy with them,2
love this comfortable comfy mask for my little guy but after 3rd use knit pulling away from fleece very disappointed,0
it fits nice and is comfortable but doesnt pull my shoulders back as much as i was hoping it would,1
this jacket is super cool i thought i bought a large but turns out i bought a xlarge so whoops oh well just means it will last longer and keep my hands warm,2
great for your camera etc better than most cases for me i have many,2
uncomfortable around the ears,2
the fabric is poor quality and looks terrible after a few washes the fabric also picks up and holds onto lint pet hair etc these have been quickly religated to at home comfy pants only,0
58 size 4 140 pounds typically wear a medium these fit perfectly and were so comfortable i was worried after reading some of the reviews but they were the right length wore with a 34 in heel i received compliments all night from girls guys gays big hit 1010 recommend i even washed them before wear and they held up line dry,2
this material is very shiny i sent it back because it looked a little too cheap,0
i wear these with my berkinstocks open toe one has developed a hole in the toebr havent had them a month i do not put these in the dryerbr i like the socks but the foot part squished my toes i wear a 85 shoe footbed is to shortbr my solution i will have the toe portion altered cut off costing more than the socks as i stated i like the feel of the socks on my calf a bit perplexing,1
good slippers good deal but definitely not like a cloud more like hard plastic but cheap,0
wasnt enough stretch,1
no le sirvió a mi reloj le quedó grande,0
i really like this hat it looks just like the photo the only drawback is that it can lose its shape easily i fixed it by stuffing it with newspaper nonetheless its cute and fuzzy i love the leopard ears and bill where else do you find a hat that looks like this it is cute and inexpensive i enjoy it and you stand out with it on,2
it fits perfect for my eyes but no uv protection,1
the shoes fit well but seam around top edge was rough and rubbed i had to return,0
the size chart made zero sense shoes were huge and hard my daughter will have to wait years to wear them wouldnt buy again,0
se sienten muy ligeros los lentes de buena mano factura los cristales muy buenos pero el plástico parece un poco frágil veré cuanto duran y actualizo reseña si es necesario,2
too small,1
wonderful,2
okay very thin inside not softdid not lay like photo,1
i needed to remove three links from the band the company sent instructions promptly when i requested clarification on how to remove the pins the pins were almost impossible to remove i was almost ready to give it up return the band when the first pin came out i have a couple of puncture wounds but i successfully removed the links the band is attractive but the pins should not be this difficult to remove,1
ordered this in two colors and the matching pants im a size small 32d and its a little loose on the shoulders which would be solved by a larger bust im fairly muscular so im not sure how it would do for more petite women unfortunately mine came with the tags already removed and it had been tried on before keeping because i like it but i paid for new condition not returned so definitely disappointed in that,2
tried to use it for my wedding day and it didnt last the first out of wearing itbr and the top of my dress was not super heavy or anything and it just didnt work also my hair kept getting stuck in it which made it worse,0
good value for what you get just be prepared to resize them all they are super duper large which is better than too small,1
this is pretty in person vivid colored flowers lose fit casual i get lots of compliments on it i put it on over my long tank tops cute look,2
love the design super cute and comfy but the part that clicks into the watch isnt very sturdy i constantly have to check and make sure its still secured on the watch if it wasnt for that it would be 5 stars,1
it is of average quality be careful because it is seethrough so a pair of harem pants boy shorts or leggings are definitely needed,1
i really like the watch except for one major thingthe clasp is silver while the frame of the watch face is gold major oversight if you ask me,1
broke the first time i wore them even though they seem to be made very sturdy i really love the added style they provide just wish the chains were reinforced better the company i ordered them through is replacing them with another pair so hopefully they will hold up better,1
shoes are good just a bit hard and dont feel comfortable,1
cheap but look coolscratch easily,1
for me these didnt work they look to be high quality but for me the edges were a little sharp and dug into my skin,0
this shirt is made very tight and small if you want it to hang like it does in the photo u better buy a huge one lol i bought a very late size hoping it would be very lose and baggy and it fits very tightly,1
these earrings are a great size and well made however the bonded gold finish looks fake i dont feel comfortable wearing them and should have returned them,0
my daughter is a lifeguard this sweater keeps her warm while she works,2
not as large as youd think like a normal winter scarf not oversized,1
ordered this dress for a rehearsal dinner i read reviews and it sounded like this dress ran really small i decided to order a large my normal size is a small i reviewed the dress and it was huge the length was good but the waist was much bigger than i expected and was tts this dress is good quality for the price i sent it back but it was a cute option,1
girlfriend loved them,2
large amount of hats purchased for a ferry ride birthday party and they were a hit high quality good for multiple usage,2
ordered large based on previous reviews fits good very thinlight weight,2
the headbands look great except the army green the main reason why i bought this set isnt green at all it is a chocolate brown,1
i have a 27 inch inseam and the 27 i ordered were too short that never happens,1
i ordered these for my 8yo that is allergic to all the others and i need to keep an eye on her piercings these are babysized way too small for even an 8 yo,1
worst product ever would not say on foot way to small paid over 38 for 4 pairs of junk have to go round the world to even return think my shopping with this company is over,0
this was huge no way is it an adult small and there was no tag on it so no way to tell what it was supposed to be more like an adult large,0
terrible quality had to return,0
this swimming suit is okay i ordered a couple sizes up and it was a little big had to do some alterations one of those alterations was adding a bra there is zero support im a 42 dd i need some support it also only lasted me one summer both sides under the armpit rippedspit,1
great price and you get a lot which is great because theyre so tiny you lose them a lot decent product though,1
the dress is lovely i ordered a 2x and it fits perfectly dose need a petticoatplan on wearing it to walt disney world the fabric is 95 cotton and 5 of a stretchy fabric it arrived folded in a nice plastic bag there were wrinkles but a warm iron took care of them the length is great was worried that it may be short but it falls just below the knee a great dress there are washing instructions,2
the size was right but the sweatshirt was an off black i was disappointed in the color presented after one wash it looked faded i would recommend the product but not in black,1
i love how comfy the cut is suoer cute in front and just low enough to feel sexy but not show a slip the cut in the behind to crotch are is way more comfortable compared to other bodysuits i own its one of my favorite im 52 and 115 for reference and a b36,2
shirt runs small,1
no es de buena calidad,0
great pair of slippers fit to size cushioned soft warm inside the house i dont wear them outdoors,2
rip off and a piece of junkbr the picture is of another itembr its cheap awful and bait and switch,0
all the bracelets are ok but the black one has a frayed string that sticks out and looks crappy all the other one are fine though,1
high quality but weird fit on me too baggy on top and too tight around band might be just fine for others but not my style or comfortable sorry returned,1
its a work shirt and a decent one at that,1
to small,0
waaaaaayyyyyy too small,0
beautiful just runs a bit big,1
way to smallthe size is not right,0
bad quality,0
was a gift to an employee and it lost all the color in a matter of days the neckless is pretty but the point was it was her birthstone,1
always get good quality from jansport,2
one of the beads on the purple bracelet was broken and must figure out how to remove it without damaging the others,1
needs a battery solar panels wont charge wont turn anything with weight like a roll of pennies,0
there is too much going on with this jacket i looks like a girls jacket,0
im giving four stars because the heel is not too tall as you see in the pictures but otherwise they are perfect the color the material the design and the quality are good,2
this dress is great the only downside is that this navy dress is black or so close that it is practically black please be cautious if you are looking specifically for a navy dress if you are okay with a black dress that is flowy feminine and really a great value this is the dress,1
narrow toe box not for me,0
i knew from other people who purchased this shoe that they run 2 sizes smaller than your actual size if you add 2 sizes example i wear an 8 so i purchased a 10 they will fit perfectly like mine did great dance shoe,2
did not like the fit on this jacket was way too big and im 6 180 lbs returned it refund still hasnt been issued 2 weeks after returning,0
tarnished so fastbr i would rate no star but i had to pick one,0
used for party favors for a my daughters birthday and the girls loved them friendship bracelet,2
it was fine in the beginning but that didnt last long i used it in a dreadnought acoustic guitar not necessarily large in any way i play at church once a week so its not under heavy use either after a few weeks i noticed the vinyl or plasticy part of the strap started to split after about two months of playing i gave up i dont trust this strap any longer as i believe it will fail soonbr the actual cotton part of the strap is fine kind of soft certainly not abrasive or bothersome in any regard,0
this coat is beautiful it can be worn in a professional setting or over jeans for a more casual look its 53wool so it should be fairly warm ive never had a wool blend coat that is washable so i think the description of machine washable is a mistake the black was 4000 more than the charcoal but my picky kid absolutely loved this black coat perfect fit for a slim 508 140lb he wears it over his suit,2
perfect fit even for me a senior citizen by the way because its sassy and classy,2
the back and fabric,1
i bought this bra in a 38gi am normally a 36g but the band of the 36 was too tight the 38g fit well in the band and the cup so i would suggest sizing up in this way however after owning this bra for one week wearing it 3 times washing once it has stretched considerably and is no longer as supportive as it was when i bought it the straps in particular have stretched and there is no way to adjust them i was so excited about this bra at first that i ordered another color right away i sent the second one back this is just cheaply made and not worth it,0
they are fine bought as a present for my mom they are quite tiny and fairly 34flimsy34 feeling but still pretty,1
im a not overly endowed 36c or 34d trim and athletic but the girls need support to look nice i wear a medium in this fit coverage are good nothing hangs out pads have good coveragebr br straps on this do not adjust i always shorten the straps on all my bras and bikinis and the strap length on this works for me if you usually have to lengthen straps the straps may be too short for youbr br ive put a shirt over these and there are 2 things i dont like 1 these have a seam on the cup that shows through medium thick material and 2 the shape they hold me in isnt flattering under clothes they let the girls slide outward to the sidesbr br in summary these are soft comfy and provide adequate support for sleeping or around the house but they dont look great under clothesbr br under clothes i much prefer the dobreva womens lace padded httpswwwamazoncomdpb088f8nwmb,2
these came in much larger than i thought they would be they take up my entire lobe i thought they would me smaller more dainty but they are clunky great idea for kids the backs are just clear plastic very cheap probably easy to fall out thats a huge negative to somebr br i would recommend these for a young girl under twelve dont expect quality but for the price if you really like them it can still be a good deal i will never wear mine,1
after reading all the reviews i thought these would be a winner not so the size i almost always wear pinched my toes i also found the sole to be hard and there wasnt enough arch support for me,0
soooooooo long cant wear it so it just sits in my closet because i didnt return it on time,0
wonderful rain coat lightweight but a durable material finding full length rain coats with a decent hood is impossible and no one cant use umbrellas in northern ca too windy for years ll bean sold a good coat but the price went up and the quality went downhill but this outback trading coat is wonderful good length im 57 and the coat in xl comes down to my lower calf deep zipped pockets on the sides and a velcro pocket on the inner left roomy hood and cords to cinch it up against wind and rain the feature that was the nicest due to the lightweight nylon of the coat i wear whatever layers underneath to stay warm norcal winters rain storms no messing about with a zip in liner which may or may not keep you warm if you live in warmer areas this jacket works like a long windbreakerbr apparently its packable but havent tried that feature yet i got a size larger than normal so as to wear layers underneath if necessary would definitely travel with this coat,2
i love the idea of this bracelet unfortunately a few of the 34pearls34 are oddly colored and look exceptionally cheap,1
its pretty but the size is smaller than ordered,0
i ordered the track suitthe preview looks like leggings type style that is not accurate you will recieve a polyesterstraight leg pant with elastic waist band top was ok correct sizing the jacket too is a polyestercheap feeling thin material the bottom of the jacket also has elastic which picture does not show the description was inaccurate i would not order from this company again,0
it is a very cute watch band but its a pain in the butt to get on also one of the pins that came with it was too short so i had to use one that i had from another band also it runs small so definitely order the large if you are usually a small,2
great product i love it,2
these dont long so they are essentially a waste of money i was not impressed and will not purchase again,0
they run smaller i know roxy runs small but my daughter wears a size 13 and i think i should of order a size 2 instead of the size 1 i order the sandals alone are cute,1
negative points,0
videoid31b5de51264ec60c3e5514c5ccbedcf thought this ring looked really cool the idea of having an image on the ring is super cool upon opening it a a gift my husbands face went from excited to immediate disappointment first off the image is blurry and not like the pictures at all more of an abstract image then forest the size was not true as well he has a knot theory silicone ring size 8 and a metal ring size 8 this one was an 8 as well but very tight on his finger he wore it for one night and it hurt his finger and left a dent we will be returning this for another knot theory ring even though the etching wore off after 10 months of wearing it still fit great and my husband loves itbr br update customer service at groove life reached out to resolve any issues we had which was great we are still returning the ring but i have added an extra star for appreciating them contacting me to help,1
runs big,1
does not look like a cats ears more like a little bears ears but still a cute hat my son and i love wearing it and we get looks from people lol great hat but i am a little disappointed,1
i got a 6xl and i am 62 and weight about 175 perfect,2
as you might expect one can practically watch tv through this shirt,0
this was more a large than a 2x to be sure,1
love the hat exactly what i wanted,2
was not what i expected,1
pin holding the band to the watch connect popped off almost immediately fixed it several times but it popped off again and we couldnt find it could have lost my brand new watch do not buy,0
too tight for my husbands feet the slippers were very narrow,1
fit very small compared to t shirts in stores colors were different shades of grey disappointing purchase,0
i really liked the fabric and fit initially but the elastic waist gave out too quickly to be useful youve got to baby these with hand washing and i think the elastic died when they made it into the washer,1
nice dress but it looks nothing like the picture and the material is cheap and transparent,1
por quality,0
waaaaaaay too smallbr im a size 1214 so i ordered an xxl it fits my bff who is a size 6 perfectlybr do not waste ur time and,0
nice bra but not much support i usually wear a 38 bc or large this one in l is a bit too loose and doesnt seem to provide support i got one in beige and one in white and both feel the same in terms of support the lower band also rolls up its not wide enough to stay flat,1
excellent jacket they run a little large however so i gifted the medium i got and ordered a small for myself,2
even if this is a costume wig the photo is impressive and the real thing is not the product i received was snow white like a santa beard or angel hair like the kind you throw on your christmas tree it did not match the platinum blond like the photobr br additionally the bands of the weft can easily be seen which to me make the whole thing look very fake and unappealing you are better off getting a wig called incognito by forever young which has a very platinum color rich and thick layers of hair and will not have the unsightly wefting bands show throughbr br the amazon store i purchased mine from wanted to charge me a 20 restocking fee block buster costumes even after i explained the problems in addition the company did not want to pay for the return shipping thank goodness amazon is there to help i will be working this return over the next few days hopefully i can get my money backbr br update 92513 the block buster costume would not work with amazons customer satisfaction policy they sent me an email and they want me to return the item my cost and then they will see if i should get a refund they would also not give me return shipping rma or anything and said that a refund was not promised i did not wear the wig and i think they might think i wore the cheap thing and then want to return it but that is not the case just looking at it in my hand at arms length i could tell the thing was so cheaply and poorly made i certainly would not wan that thing on my head if i returned the wig paid for shipping and if i got charged a 20 restocking fee i would have paid out extra with no guarantee and no product in my hand block buster costumes has it rigged in their favor with no guarantee and definitely no concern for customer satisfaction,0
love them there was a tiny scratch on one of the lenses but isnt noticeable unless you are standing very close to my face,2
its a nice boot and fits good but started falling apart after having them for 3 days,0
the watch looks clean and sharp however it isnt outstanding it is rather slim and not remarkable for the price there are much better choices for outstanding watches again nothing wrong with the watch just very understated for my taste,1
the top part of the dress is too loose and looked weird even with a slip otherwise a really pretty dress,0
my older woolrich shirt of same label size is inches bigger than this version laying new on top of old the old shirt is way bigger at every point shoulders sleeves and width below bust new shoulders are over an inch less each side than my older shirt and the overall width below bust is almost 4 inches smaller combined both sides than my older shirt the fabric is ultra soft nice but what good is that if i cannot wear it i plan to donate to one of my daughters,1
the snowman and the merry christmas were upside down would have received a 5 star rating,1
this is quiet small and if you are trying to carry anything over than a very small item or two it really wont fit it cannot hold winter gloves and hat for example so its cute and small if you want small this is the bag for you the quality and overall design seems fine just not the size i was hoping for,1
i was always skeptical of these some seem very junky and not what you would expect my son really wanted them so i agreed to split it with him to get him to do some chores go figure whenever we go shopping or are out of the house when he knows we will be walking around we bring them he just scoots ahead of us and is very entertained perfect for my 8 yr old and a good gift i would bet for kids who surf or skateboard scooter you know skate kids which my son is,2
waaaaaayyyy too small no options for bigger size returning,0
i absolutly love this dress and am tempted to order it in a smaller size but im terrified it will still be to big i have followed the sizing method to a t and the item arrived could have fit two of me however the quality of fabric and stitching was satisfactory i personally just dislike any form of a return method it is too time consuming and take too long to get my money back,1
i like the pattern but they run on the small side it is long but narrow i like the material it easy wear,1
way too small for an adult male when i open my mouth to speak it comes off my nose no matter how tight i make it dont waste your money what time if you have a large head or nose,0
this sterling rosary necklace is just beautiful it arrived just as described highly polished and well crafted i have enjoyed wearing it,2
not at all like described,0
i love this sweater i look amazing in it and feel amazing and my daughter is jealous of it and my husband complimented me what else could i want,2
my daughter loves it,2
after about a month the shine went away and it turned into an awful brownish copper color,0
its really cute but the hood is way smaller than it should be,0
i love the bootsits why i bought the size 10m a 10w or 10 12 w would have been the perfect size,2
dive watches are a really cool style but you have to know the line between waterproof and water resistant once water got it it went to heck and i just got another watch still it got several complements and was nice while it lasted,1
cute and casual very comfortable ordered a small at 56 130lbs fits as expected dark green color is accurate,2
this is autumn colored hat warm insides cute and practical,2
i love it,2
good,2
i like the design the vent take a way from the patch work on the side all in all the shirt is as advertised,1
not good quality i found one broke i was so sad and disappointed,0
great sock just not much compression,2
videoid126a83d096221341126f303f5e8c54f1 poorly made i wore it one time and the handle came off guess you get what you pay for,0
i bought this black cheetah baggalini for a friend when she finally went to her po box she was surprised and thanked me for 34the pumpkin bag34 i ordered a black bag and an orange bag was delivered insteadbr br the description clearly states 34cheetah black34 and i bought it for my friend when she complimented me on my black baggalini bag delivery was fast my friend likes the bag she didnt know i ordered black but buyer bewareyou may order one color but receive delivery of something different,0
i bought these to mostly wear around the house the sizing is off and each one provides very little support i probably could have ordered a size or two down and gotten better compression the straps are super long for some reason and the only one of the pack that sort of tries to hold things in is the grey one i actually laugh out loud thinking about what a horror show these would be even during minimalmovement workouts things would be going everywhere you definitely get what you pay for here and maybe a little less,0
comfortable shoe,2
i love this necklace so much always get a ton of compliments on it when i wear it great product and worth the money,2
beautiful dress super soft and stretchy gave four stars only because the burgundy i ordered looks more like red unless they sent the wrong color either way im keeping it im 51 125lbs 34dd chest got a medium and its perfect hit at the knee,2
they were a gift for my roommate they were smaller then expected but shes used to disappointment at this point,2
it was a little big on top for her,1
these shorts are perfect super soft fabric stays in place with the essential phone pocket nice length as well not too short or too long also great high rise flattering waist band would 100 recommend for athleisure wear workouts yoga biking anything,2
nothing about these matters in light of the fact that their size 910 is actually a size 8 if that they are incredibly small and i did double check to be sure they sent the right size they are simply terribly small and unusable for anyone above a size 8 the person using this pair is a size seven an actual 7 so these get one star because they are wholly unusable its not a matter of a slight sizing error they are sized completely wrong and to such a degree that i wouldnt trust the brand to be consistent in sizing errors i cant recommend sizing up because i cant tell you how much larger to go given how bad these are good luck in your search,0
purchased this for 8 year old daughter she had a growth spurt and is a little taller than average purchased the 8 year to 14 year leotard and it was great it was comfortable and thankfully a thinner material since she wore a heavy costume and the theaters air conditioning was under repair she was comfortable in this leotard and there is room for her to grow with it the transition straps are handy happy with purchase,2
material is too thin and shows everything,0
runs large no support returned for refund,0
these run about a size small my so says they are comfortable,1
will update if i ever get what i ordered after waiting weeks for fish scales i get solid black now i get to send them back and start all over again,0
great dress pants but the material is rough so if the legs slightly rub it creates loud sound,0
other reviews said to go up one sizeid say more like 23 sizes on top of that thr fabric is very thin see through i was happy to find something that was all cotton but this was a definite nogo and i quickly returned it,0
its a good overall but one of the cuff buttons fell off they should be more secure,1
every picture of this watch doesnt show how thick it really is it looks like a thin bracelet but the actual watch is three times as thick as the watch band this makes it top heavy and ruins the look it is trying to go for,1
fits wellaccessorize to up the glam,2
absolutely love these nightgowns what can i say we love donuts so when i saw these just before valentines day i had to get them for my girls im not one to spend this much on a set of pjs but they are worth it the fabric is thick and i can tell they will hold up for many washes my girls are 4 and 2 so i ordered a size 6 and 4 so they would be big no joke they ask to wear there nearly every night worth the splurge,2
i bought a size up 4t for my 35 year old after the first wash it it is very very snug maybe it will last a couple of months if we are lucky when it arrived there was a hole on the side of one of the shirts it was sewn incorrectly i hand to hand sew about two inches of cloth to close the hole its ot the softest the left it as three stars because my kid loves these and wants tj on all the time,1
i can not tell what the material is but it is very thin otherwise it fits okay,1
the faux fur was so incredibly itchy and made my skin on my wrist break out i couldnt even keep it on for 10 minutes save your money and do not go with this watch band,0
add says 100 silk tag says 100 polyester i figured that it wouldnt be great quality silk but there isnt any silk im tired of being ripped off by false advertising on here,0
so many compliments and buttery smooth,2
fits everywhere except chest extremely tight,0
odd fit was not for me but for a fellow colleague at work she told me that one shoe is slightly turnt inward that the base of the boot does not line up right also the sizing was off one boot fit wider then the other both were clearly indicated to be the same size she also stated that she couldnt really complain at 30 but it was a disappointment,0
horrible,0
cute but itchy,1
soft loosefitting basic shirt no complaints there but it wrinkles like crazy be prepared to iron it every time you want to wear it,1
these pants fit me just as i was hoping they are comfortable and i can easily wear them all day whether sitting or standing without feeling as though i cannot breathe,2
horrible i bought the set of 3 for my daughters horrible quality not only did the earrings turn but their ears were black i even tried polishing them nothing worked waste of money,0
not a very soft fabric not stretchy at all has no give comfortable to mow the lawn in will not use for running at all,1
cool designs plan on wearing in the summer,2
my husband wears compression socks following surgery and these socks are a good value they do fit as expected hard to put on firmer at the toe than the cuff note that compression socks do wear out after a time so the fact that these come in a package of 6 is good incidentally our daughter who is a nurse wears compression socks also although she prefers colorful ones and she considered these to be a good bargain she also tells me that anyone whos on his or her feet a lot should always wear these,2
super cheap quality but i guess you get what you pay for would not recommend,0
a cute set butthe tank shrunk to a much smaller size the shorts and sports bra kept its shape and the size didnt seem to change,1
these are very cute although when it arrived it he overall color is pinkish in the picture it looks red,1
beautiful pants but too short in the crotch for me wish they would include that measurement on the sizing charts,0
giving this 3 stars bc its see through,1
like most shirts from china you have to order at least two sizes up if you have any kind of shoulder width i bought several of these shirts in the vertical stripes because im over 55 and stocky unfortunately unless i lose about another 10 or 15 lb i cant wear these yet,1
this is super cool i love the color on this shirt the picture is super pretty but doesnt do the shirt justice its even better in person the material is super soft i cant wait to wear it for halloween fits great,2
overall this is a fine watch but not a great option for a smartwatchbr br it is a flashy watch the black and gold combo makes quite a statement it has a lot of style and is a fun watch to wear with the right outfit it may be a little too much for a conservative workplace but works for a friday or saturday nightbr br but the watch is a little too flashy to be much use as a smartwatch to be an effective smartwatch the style needs to be a little more subdued so that you are comfortable wearing it every day you need to want to wear a smartwatch every day to take full advantage of its best features including activity and goal tracking i also found the instructions a little too complicated to use easily especially when the alternative is to rely on the phone you always have with you anywaybr br another problem that may be particular to me is that the lettering on the dial is microscopic this makes it less useful for men of a certain age who dont want to be reminded of their fading eyesight im not sure the lettering had much purpose but its no fun to be reminded that youre too old to figure it out anymore so i wouldnt recommend it for anyone worried about their eyesight,1
i really wanted to love these i bought these while my sister was visiting so we could have fun in the pool they fit great and are very comfortable but they didnt last two dives into the water before they fogged up we made sure we fitted them properly to our heads and that the suction sealed fine but we had to stop using them because they fogged up so bad every time wed go underwater very disappointing,0
this necklace is way too small for the price i love the look and how dainty it is but the price ridiculous,0
very comfortable accurate size ideal for indoor or outdoor good foot support,2
keeps the whole head and face warm in the sharp winds of chicago in the corona world it performs the dual function of a filtering mask as well great for daily use as well,2
everyone loved it,2
the suit itself is lovely but the appearance on the breast area looks horrible,0
looks nice passport fits in it well all cc cards fell out holds nothing else other than passpost junk,1
favorite undies now repeat purchase great quality and like the size an style,2
these shorts show coming with a belt but did not this is the second pair of jet lag shorts that were supposed to come with a belt but didnt,0
its super cute but broke way to easy wouldnt recommend,1
these leggings are amazing they are comfy and can be worn as business casual love love love,2
this jacket fits as expected it is warm the jacket has many pockets that come in handy i love it,2
ive owned several of these punshirts in the past mostly gotten as gifts and i wanted a new one because the others wore outbr br this is a much higher quality shirt the fabric is nicely soft the printing is good quality and i am extremely pleased,2
i wasnt expecting a high end pair of sunglasses but these feel cheaply made and look like plastic,0
was a gift for my sister she loved the socks,2
junk they broke the first time i wore them,0
strong product didnt care for the color,1
im 50 170 bought a size large fits snug but the color i got which is pink is really prettyz,1
i am neither happy or disappointed its a inexpensive pair of scrubs there is no real stretch to them and they run a tad bit small will i buy these again no i will spend a few more to get some with a little lycra,1
the quality is there,2
videoidc4dd360030f0e21efd68e7cb4bf35310 muy buen producto buena atención del vendedor,2
a bit itchy but it was good for the event,2
liked the style but the quality of material not so much,1
great shirt washes well and fits nice,2
small and disappointing not everything has been delivered,0
pros dress was well made for the price seemed sturdy and nice material cons didnt fit long torso waist too high sleeves not cut in a flattering way bottom line you probably wont know if it fits you unless you try it on it runs slightly large,1
i get a lot of compliments on these ear muffs and they are adorable however they are larger than they appear in the photo which can be deceivingbr though for me i find them comfortable and perfect for colder days when i dont want to ruin my hair with a hat be warned they are not adjustable,2
very disappointedthey run big and way too thin wearing it one time it started to come apart from its seam see pic,0
i want to like these for their simplicity its basically one mold like the old wax toys youd buy for a dollar at an entertainment park it feels like you are stepping on a rock im walking around the living room dreading having to return them the top looks and feels good im a 105 and the elevens are a perfect fit i dont like the sole,0
the are made well and the fit was perfect for me the lining is so soft and comfortable and does not ball up when wearing them,2
my son loves these slippers he says they are warm and super comfortable they have enough traction he is not sliding all over the hardwood floorsbr br true to size if you are between sizes i recommend going for the size up,2
loved the detach collars the quality is great and i am impressed because some of the reviews i read were not good the straps on the sides are adjustable and the chest coverage is decent dont know i did not order these sooner a must have accessory in your closet,2
this is a thinner jacket but does a nice job of keeping you warm made quite well with good construction and zippers the fabric is soft and durable fit is as expected recommended,2
a little smaller than what the size said but fits ok overall the image does seem more pleated from the front than what i got but its still ok to wear,1
thanks,0
they are compression but they did feel too tight for the size thats supposed to be for me after a few months they started to develop holes on the sides from over stretching,1
these glasses are very nice they fold up easily and have a nice case to slip into your pocket and remain protected i got them in both of my cars,2
they looked good i bought this as a gift,2
its a cute suit i wouldnt wear it again if swimming the fabric absorbs a lot of water and doesnt dry very quickly ive never worn a swimsuit that absorbed so much water,1
had a rip when it arrived returned,0
flimsy barely used it and a whole ripped through not worth buying,0
i noticed the item had multiple sticky stuff on it and on the headband i washed it and didnt even wear it yet but the stains are embedded on the robe and doesnt come offbr i want to return the item since it doesnt seem new and looks dirty,0
although charming these fluevogs were quite short in the toe and not at all flattering to my foot,1
if youre looking for a well organized and roomy crossbody bag this might work well for you the bag is made of dark brown glossy patent leather the bag is well organized with 3 zippered compartments the top of the bag has 2 zippered compartments with an open area in the middle it is great for holding things that youll need quickly there is a zippered side compartment as well so you can slip in smaller items and find them fast the zippered compartments are well organized as well with numerous pockets i think it would work particularly well when traveling or when have to juggle many items,1
good colorbut pin is too long,1
these earrings are well worth the purchase i got the black and white ones and they go with everything much lighter than they look and they make such a statement,2
pretty but it fell apart after a couple of weeks,1
this is the worst made piece of clothing i have ever purchased the fabric is flimsy and the sewing is poorly done must be made in chinabr too badbr jw,0
cute set shirt and shorts are a little on the short side,1
the style is super cute but its fits smaller than expected i would size up at least 1 size if not 2 there is no stretch at all,1
only 5 of the 6 arrived,0
ordered 2 only one came took very long time maybe came from china had to cancel 2nd one very thin says 100 cotton but it doesnt feel like it because of this glad 2nd one didnt come,1
this is an absolutely gorgeous watch i was hesitant because of some reviews but so glad my husband ordered it for me a beautiful birthday present,2
good product but too large for me,1
shirt is nice fits good and quality fabric,2
daughter loved the sweater,2
very pleased with the purchase of the sunglasses my daughter liked them so much she wants me to order a pair for her these sunglasses are just as nice as ray ban at a third of the price,2
i bought these after buying and loving a pair of the ghost model first i should qualify this review by saying i am not a runner so i cant speak to using these for running they provide good support and have a very comfortable foot bed the only complaint i have about these is that the cushioning material in the heel tab the part that contacts the tendon above the heel tends to get pushed down and balled up so it feels weird and puts pressure below where it should it definitely happens if i try to slide my foot in without sufficiently opening the shoe or using a shoe horn then i have to take the shoe off and manually work the material back into place other than that i find these to be as comfortable and supportive as the ghost 12s,1
i ended up returning this piece because it was too large overall i am petite and ordered the smallest size but the shoulders bust waist hips were all just a bit too wide even if it had fit i wasnt a fan of the material on the sleeves and collar it was an itchy flimsy material the body of the dress was a nice knit that was think enough to not be seethrough and fell to just below the knee for this price point i didnt expect too much but the sleeves were a disappointment,1
these are not squat proof and quite sheer in general,0
these are a bit pricey i thinkeven though my husband needs a 12i got the larger size because i needed the width he has congestive heart disease and sometimes his feet legs swell upso they serve the purpose of me being able to get them on his feet easy with easebesides being a bit expensivei bought 6 pairwe have only used 4 pair so far and out of those 4 all but one are goodand one sock lost its shape at the top around the ankle and stretched out with the first wash and will not stay up and always falls down,2
these were way better than expected great quality fit right and look great,2
soft and great fit was a perfect xmas present,2
i absolutely love the cut and design of this dress but the sizing is way off my 6 year old is a small size 7 but the listing didnt have her size i got the 910 thinking that she could just grow into it but it is way too small i barely got the zipper up and its way too short,0
nunca entendi las intrucciones y nunca loo pude programar para mi nino,1
the glasses are ok for the price be aware they come in a plastic bag they do not have a case or anything like that,1
es de pésima calidad y se parece en nada al producto publicitado,0
wears out quickly hole in sole,0
awesome value very stylish nice comfort,2
i wear a 12 and have bought the large i have a couple of older pairs from many years ago i wear them as house socks because i love the cushion on the bottom on tile floors these were fine until washed where they shrunk up to the point i cannot wear them they hurt my toes due to the stretching and the back of the heal is no longer tall enough if i were to use them in shoesbr br buy only if you have a smaller foot and then buy a size larger,0
my husband loves this mese tank to work out in this is the 3rd set we bought,2
didnt fit like picture to small,0
3,1
could not get it to go on one side not a very good product,0
arms a little off body and fit were correct,1
these look better than they are pieces break off rather easily and a few areas are difficult to flip colors the size is for smaller heads barely fitting my adult head,0
these are smaller than the size indicates by a significant amount i purchased the 24monthsized pants and they were smaller than my 12monthsized pants from burts bees baby and hudson baby doesnt preshrink the fabric they use either so these would definitely have shrunk had i washed them ive learned my lesson ill stick with the established baby clothing brands for clothes and shop this brand for sleep sacks and accessories only,0
receiving this was not what i expected it was less practical than i wanted cards and id were difficult to remove from wallet i quickly made another purchase of a different wallet gave a 3 strictly because build quality was good otherwise would have scored lower,1
as far as looks materials couldnt ask for better ordered a lxl wear a 7 34 could not get it on my head stretch band had no give at all fit like 7 12 uncomfortable shame cause it looks so good,1
cheaply made and the horns dont sit right on your head,0
toooo small ordered 1x it fit like a large cmon whose doing the sizing also arrived with white deodorant powder marks smelling like perfume yuck br returned money refunded thank goodness,0
these earrings are upside down in the photothrows off the look a bit and i had to double check the listing to be sure the color is a muted lavender very pretty quite cheaply made but for the price and for a pair of earrings purchased for a specific outing they will do but the gold circle is the post then the flowers with the largest flower at the bottom,1
cuteness factor these are 55 easy if youre looking for fashion in the gym go for itbr br id give the shorts a 455 the only thing that could make them better is pockets the ribbed texture provides medium compression the length in the legs and height of the waste are perfect imobr br the top is definitely fashion over function i dont like how the neck fits it is a little constricting like a necktie it sits between my traps and neck but doesnt lie flat it kind of rubs when i try to move for mobility and comfort i give the top 25,1
these were too small and the legs lengths were crooked and off by 2 inches i threw them away,0
make sure you read the full description because the title alone will mislead you this is gold platednot solid white gold dont get me wrong its beautiful but its cheaply made only the smaller stones are swarovski crystals and the large one in the middle is cubic zirconia may make a nice gift for a child but thats it,1
i love bzees shoes but these werent for me although they were billed as wide width they were uncomfortably narrower than the regular width bzees i own on top of that i walked out of them despite getting the size i usually wear its as though the wide size was extended in length but not in width i returned them which was a pain because they didnt come with free return shipping im giving them 2 stars because in general i think bzees are great shoes with good arch support,0
love the look of these but they had a odd chemical smell to them i washed them twice right out of the package but can still smell the chemicals i wont be wearing these,0
i thought i had reached that point in my adult life when i had transitioned from wearing jeans to wearing khakis i was wrong as much as i like khakis they look horrible on me unless theyre neatly pressed and who has the time to do that not me so im kinda stuck on wearing blue jeans 7 days a week except in the summer when its too hot i have very casual and workaroundtheyard jeans and i have some really nice gotochurch jeans i bought a couple of pair of rohan jeans from the uk which are fabulous but pricey at about 90 per pairbr br so these wrangler authentics twill pants sounded interesting they come in limited colors none of them blue the black ones are the only color i would wear and i received them promptly from amazon i usually wear a 37 inch waist but thats not a choice so i went down to a 36 they fit just fine and theyre dynamite looking jeans the black is really black and while tailored like jeans these pants are really classy the stitching is remarkable and like i say they fit like they were custom tailored for me the fabric is silky smooth and of such a high quality that i think ill get these drycleaned rather than run through the rough and tumble washing machine for a whilebr br im normally a lee jeans kind of guy as most wranglers just dont fit me well but these authentics twill are on my reorder list i like them enough to purchase again i just wish wrangler would make them in a navy blue,2
disappointed not made from quality fabric dont bother wasting your money,0
i like this bracelet very much i actually have two of these bracelets i may order another one i have black and green very pretty good quality,2
the hue of the crystals are off from what is advertised however they are cute for the price,1
nice to look at dont ever think of cleaning them now garbage,0
my wife wears medium size clothes i buy for her all the time the medium i ordered though labeled medium was extra small i then ordered an extra large it was labeled xlarge but was smaller than a medium very disappointed too much trouble to send back gave to my granddaughters,0
actually super comfortable and attractive i wore them to the office today and they were great a lot of time fishnets leave marks or dig in the thighsthese did neither,2
i ordered 3 of these pair of shorts a year ago loved them this time different horrible material and a little girls size very dissapointed,0
after reading all the reviews about this fitting small i ordered a medium and it is too big on me im usually a size 2 34b 342535 115 pounds i can still make this suit work but the bottoms are definitely looser then i would prefer for the price i guess its ok but it is true that the top rides up i guess more so since i dont really have any boobs to begin with maybe it would be different for someone who has larger breasts,1
these fit differently than their 34space dyed34 sock siblings i do not like these nearly as much they are a bit too tight around my ankle,0
doesnt notify you of anything since it is not pressed against your skin the apple watch much detect skin in order for it to stay unlocked ladies you can put it in your bra t,0
these seemed short in the toe and also too wide at the same time had to return,0
very disappointingit didnt meet my expectations,0
a ordered a size up and it was still too small,0
i dislike this dress làbel reàds dry cleaningbr i dont know what it will look like but i will washbr in cold water the xl is snug i weigh 160br i ordered another xxl the fit is betterbr the dress and color is great,1
hopefully they stretch as i ride very rigid and sit an inch off my face bigger guy,1
its cute,1
videoid228ad1de6ba752941f168aa33d78e7aa im 54 at 125 lbsbr looks good feels comfy but i feel like its pretty cheap i dont think it should be as expensive as it is,1
too short,0
i did like the fact that it was sterling silver however the ear cuff was not large enough for my earlobe i was looking for an earlobe cuff to transform my pierced earrings to nonpierced,1
good fitbr material is somewhat cheapbr collar is clumsy,1
the color is exactly as pictured its long im 5 10 and soft love the pockets true to size what i didnt like was collar is sewn backwards like its supposed to be flipped down like a collared shirt but it sits more like a popped collar so it looks off i double checked the photo and its supppsed to be sewn this way i had to return,1
i ordered the correct size but runs very small,1
he loves the watch and was wearing until the band broke at work one day he has yet to find a replacement,1
love this belt for the ability to cut it to size and the ease of use provided by the ratcheting buckle i am concerned about the quality of leather however as the outside layer is flaking off in spots after several months of wearing it,1
i did not like the way this dress fit me i am tall and slim and it was not flattering on mebr i returned it,0
it looks like a childs toy my wife wore it once and it fell apart i would not buy this product again,0
the arch support is just not there it is a shame because the shoes are very comfortable with the memory foam but after wearing them all day i found my feet hurt i switched back to my fitflops that have fantastic arch support these are only good for an hour or two,1
best luggage i have ever owned they have held up well to our adventurous international travel dragging them through the airport checked baggage horrors of rough handling hopping on and off trains and buses rolling them several blocks down sidewalks in search of our hotel they rolled relatively easy in any direction so glad i chose this set love it,2
i love the color but the shape is odd it is small at the top breast area and big at the bottom it has no shape whatsoever so it looks to tight on my breast and big on the stomach area,1
the goggles didnt work very well in the ocean but where fine in the pool,1
these were not sized accordingly bought others of same size and they fit well these are way too small,0
it is a nice outfit but not for women that are short,0
looks and feels cheap im a curvy hourglass and it was very unflattering i dont recommend it,0
let me first say that this is my first attempt using waterproofing waxes i like that it is all natural and makes for a more rugged look so i thought id give it a try i tested it out on a cotton baseball hat that doesnt get much use in case i ruined it i took the advice of other reviewers and used a hairdryer to help the wax application a little sitting next to a fireplace or space heater may work just as well also it took a lot of elbow grease and rubbing into the seams of the hat to get what i think is an even application it feels pretty waxy despite trying to rub it in with my fingers im entering the curing period which could take up to 3 days per otter wax guidelines and well see how it looks and performs the hat started a true brown color and with the wax now looks like a nice deep grey an improvement in my eyes it took me at least 20 minutes to apply to just the hat so i can imagine that doing an entire jacket or backpack would take quite a long time hopefully the cured result will be great and it will keep my head dry in unexpected rain showers i will update my review when the curing has finished and i have tested the hat i received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review,1
to small,0
fit fine definitely only good for sleeping very low impact no support whatsoever but comfy for lounging around the house,1
shipping was fast but the item looks very cheap ill give to my daughter and buy something else,0
such a cute shoe but so incredibly tight on the top after an hour i had huge red marks on the top of my feet,1
ive tried many different running shoes nike ua brooks saucony adidas and always keep coming back to asics kayanos imo best running sneaker out there,2
they run about two sizes too small so buy accordingly,1
when i opened my package the this item was for a small person not a 2x tall large im disappointed cause now i have to pay and mail it back,0
the watch i received is similar but was not the watch as on the picture and as on the description i am waiting for the replacement watch to arrive to see if its the same as described on the picture or the same as the one i already received which is different without the date and with only one dial,0
larger than expected,0
sweater does not look like it does in the picture the quality is not great,0
soft comfortable very stylish wish my first choice red was in stock,2
runs large,0
i love love love these leggings they are thick and cover completely so no awkwardness of someone seeing through your leggings they also are a great fit for small to larger figures i have bought these in long and capri for myself my sister and 2 friends so i have reordered them 6 times good for leggings or yoga pants and super durable i have had my first set for almost a year and they are holding up greatand do get worn often,2
these are cool the only down side is the charge in the sneaker is not as long as expected it ran out in about 3 hours the bottomof the sneaker is like hard plastic so becareful they can be slipperly thye are made of vinyal i was diasppointed for the amount of money spent,1
like the style and fit tint is too dark lens popped out a few times but easily snaps back in not bad for the price,1
plus a great fit i really like these fuzzy slippers i hate wearing shoes around the house and these are a great compromise theyre very warm and the choice of colors means theres one to fit every mood i just ordered another pair,2
these look so good on both me and my wife that i bought a second pair they do have a little bit of a yellow tint but its not super noticeable i can definitely tell when i take them off how much more harsh the light from a screen feels on my eyes i get tons of compliments on them and nobody ever believes theyre not an expensive prescription pair,2
love the bottoms but i hate the top bottoms get 5 stars the top is too small in the cups and too big everywhere else still trying to find a different top for the bottoms,1
had to return more like a 2x than a 5x,0
not good quality at all causes a lot of static on clients doesnt comb properly since its so flimsy,0
this jumpsuit is made of very heavy material a huge negative to me also the material puckered out around the hem line on the back i tried turning it around and it wasnt much different also the angle of the straps make them impossible to stay up on my shoulders overall i was very unhappy with my jumpsuit,0
they are lightweight great lenses and quality product comes with cases and mini screwdriver very professional and durable incredible for the price,2
underwear is way to small to pair with a size d bra comon bra just deforms your boobs if you arent super firm and perky already so any real woman beware,0
comfy could wear these slippers all day long,2
the dress looked like it was made at home it had threads hanging its too long and is not shaped right i have not washed it yet but i can imagine it will not holdup well sizing was ok im a 2x five foot five inches will wear at home,0
needs to be longer,1
way to small from my normal size way more fuzy that picture looks like wearing a bathrobe,0
largebr runs smallbr will order a 2x nexts timebr had to make a hole for my button to go in,0
i love this its very comfortable i can imagine for a larger chested woman this wouldnt fit well at all as it is i am a b cup and this barely covers the nips but it is very attractive and is not at all bothersome,2
was perfect,2
they all fell out in a week couldnt tighten,0
huge skirt the best way to explain the skirt is that it stays like an umbrella when you put the dress on nice fabric and exact colors as shown in the pics though,0
i stopped ordering clothing from amazon after being disappointed multiple times from items shipping directly from asia with sizing issues and products that did not even resemble the photos whatsoever after reading the fairly positive reviews i ordered 3 of these dresses black white yellow to wear as nightgowns because the description said 100 cotton and i liked that they had pockets i should have known they were being sent from china because the shipping prediction was 30 days i received this item more quickly than expected 13 days the problem is theres absolutely no way these dresses contain even a miniscule amount of cotton the tag says 65 cotton 35 polyester but it is a lie i just compared it to a swatch of 100 polyester and its even worse quality than the 100 poly fabric is like a cheap halloween costume what looks like embroidery in the whitered dress is a cheap screen print that is sewn so poorly it is completely unwearable it doesnt match up at the seams white yellow are completely see through im wearing black panties in the photo for reference as for fit i ordered a small and they fit fairly well except the armpits are quite loose and would need to be taken in if i decided to keep this for reference im 56 120 lbs 30d 29 band size 34 bust and the dress hits approximately 3 above my knee overall the dress is cute and probably worth around 510 dollars not the 25 i paid if youre expecting cotton i would not order this dress,0
super thick im returning theres just no way you could work out in it its literally like thick long johns,0
these are great we wore them to the water park mesh holes are large enough that i could see her wearing them to the beach,2
this is my second order i ordered a small this time still too big on my frame im a true size 4 and this small size seem to make for size 6 the material is not very comfy i wouldnt recommend this one,0
this necklace came in with pretty beading on an ugly blue string which does not match the pretty black and crystal beads i will have to restring it,0
pants fit well stretchy not baggy i got the medium im 5 2 with 26 waist and 35 hips they are a little low in the back when you bend over so a belt would help belt in the pictures does not come with the pants zippers open but they are fake pockets the pocket on the left leg is pretty cool because its rather deep very stretchy pants and they feel like denim seem pretty thick only 1 pocket for the hand on the right side no pockets in the back but i like the design style of the low flaps in the back and sides pants are a little long for me but i like how they punch up around the ankles which they do taper down,2
i believe this is a fine watch but i returned it because the daydate display was too hard to read,1
i was really looking forward to this top but completely disappointed it was cut and sewn way off i guess thats what you get with cheap china clothes,0
no flexibilitybr these socks have no give they are the right size but they dont stretch well the elastic fibers break if you stretch them i know they are compression but compression socks still stretch also i dont have giant calves i have average or small calves socks being so tight they break has never been an issue bottom line not great quality,0
great product easy fit on my regular glasses,2
maybe its just me but i have problems sitting comfortably on my stationary bike i already bought a seat pad thats attached to the saddle and now i bought these they help somewhat but i wish it was a drastic relief and its not the padding is okay but feels weird and you definitely cant wear these alone youll see a weird shape under your butt the red padding also smelled weirdly metallic after i washed the shorts and i dont love that and the hem did dig into my legs a bit but i have thick thighs so i guess i expected it,1
several of these didnt work or didnt last long,0
label says wide but much more narrow than same thing purchased in store,1
just got the watch is advertised as a mechanical wind up watch and in the description says to wind before each use so i start to wind it and dont hear clicking or feeling any tension in the spring out of poops and giggles i opened the back to find a battery and that the crown is only to adjust time and date so its not what is advertised now i have to figure out if i want to spend the extra in shipping to return it otherwise for a cheap watch its adequate just not what i wanted i wanted an old school wind up because im sick of watch batteries dying then your stuck till you get a new onebr br have decided to go through the hassle of returning the watch the seller was insinuating i misread the descriptions when it clearly stated to wind before each use im now going with a jaragar watch and highly recommend looking into them they have great reviews and are old school wind up watches they even make abpoint to say their watched do not run on batteries there arw even fideos backing up that these are quality old school wind up watches now if my watch stops all i have to do is wind it up and reset the time no more making an extra trip to get a watch battery and fighting to get it installed,0
last hotouch for me all have been too small despite size chart indicating would be fine very disappointed,1
big bulky not what i expected,0
cute shirt but way too small will not fit once i wash it,1
i washed it before giving it as a present and the print got fuzzyfaded,1
the bra fit well around me but the cups were too big i went to the le mystere website and calculated my size and it said i was a 40 g so now i dont know what size i am i would try a f but i dont want to risk having to return it again also the straps were a little short the material was nice,0
washable,2
these are for the current price of 1299 before tax a pretty good valuebr br however br br they are super small if you have big lobes they will not fit that was one issue i hadbr br the main issue for me was the way these were made one of the clasps would not close no matter how i managed it it would not close so it could easily fall out that is probably due to how small they arebr br the gems are bright and could stand in for diamondsbr br if they would close theyd be a pretty cute deal,1
i love this blouse and fit perfectly,2
this shirt is so cute i bought 2 more large is true to size it hits just below your waistbr ive received many compliments on all of them,2
almost all of these fell off leaving just the clip in the shoe the jewel fell out good price but pointless if you cant use it,0
these pants are made of extremely thick and heavy material its actually kind of hard to describe the first thing that comes to mind is almost a sateen canvas or oilcloth but thats not quite it either i was hoping for a lightweight summer pant like material im tall and they were super long on me if the material draped and fell a little better i think they would be more flattering as they are they kind of balloon out thats not necessarily good or bad its just not what i was looking for was not flattering on me,1
prosbr soft and comfortablebr inexpensivebr br consbr could be thicker and subsequently warmerbr outer sole is too thinbr loosens over time,1
these run disappointingly small i couldnt get a medium much over my knees oddest thing so these are max about a size 4 the waist doesnt stretch very much and i guess i rely on that to get leggings over my hips i run between a size 6 and 8 and yes curvy but id never consider myself to be a large or extra large for this type of item of course i removed the tags and discarded the packaging that said looks like im finally going to need to invest in a measuring tape so at least some of that is on mebr br these pants feel like theyd be warm for brisk outdoor walks and the ample pockets were a huge selling point the lining feels very soft id planned on using the towel loop to hang my key from since im always afraid of it falling out of a pocket while hiking so it has great design details though i could do without the silver verbiage on the leg the wine red is a beautiful color too it would have been a five star item if the sizing was where it needed to be,1
absolutely love this watch great price great product,2
cheap fabric poorly made very disappointed please do something about your sizing,0
the adult medium is more like a kids small i bought two of these for gifts and the large i purchased wont be acceptable to gift the smaller person i ordered them for,0
i did not have high expectations for such a low price but this scarf is gorgeous the print is beautifully done and it has a sheen that makes it just right for the holidays,2
i mistook lining thinking these had built in underwear thingybut they dont these are attractive shorts but for the price i would expect a better liner,1
looks inexpensive but its cute pretty cheap material,1
i am not fond of the spinners but love the briggs and riley line i returned and got the 2 wheel version,2
ive been searching for just the right slipper for years i have purchased so many different types at different prices but none were very good i needed support a harder sole so i can wear them outside and to be able to adjust them to fit properlybr br i bought my first pair in june 2020 i wear them every single day for 14 or so hours a day i love these things so much so that i now have another pairbr br i wear a womens size 11 and the size 11 in this slipper was a perfect fitbr br update i see the price has gone from 25 to 40 rediculous,2
not what i expected but its alright,1
these are true to size and very comfortable they are cotton and spandex blend so did not shrink at all in the dryer id order another pair,2
the looks awesome but the pin is off center upside down so when you wear it the pin will turn itself upside down over time,1
didnt notice any difference,1
it is perfect,2
too wide for me and no way to make it tighter i wish they werent because they are really cute,1
top was slinky and way too small i had to return,0
this shirt is very short its cute but i would reccomend this shirt for someone with a flat stomach unlike mine,0
they are really cute but very hard to click in once in nose and the opening is a little too big so its sharpe,1
really wanted this to be a bit better quality its cheap justbb cb like all amazons clothes but its too cool to return ill keep it just know you definitely get what you pay for i will only buy popular name brands i know on here from now on,1
this is a beautiful skirt but small due to this returning,0
husband asked for this for christmas he loves it,2
i do not like the material it is hot and not much stretch,0
very cute top fits loose around the midsection and just right around the hips and arms,2
love this top very flattering,2
got it for my little girl its perfect fits my two year olds thumb for size reference,2
it was really cute my friend daughter really liked it,1
i really like these yoga pants they fit well wash up great and feel comfortable in addition to the fit and comfort i especially like the bonus of pockets which hold keys change and a phone in addition im 58 and the length of these pants is perfect,2
bellos,2
i like the idea but its the most uncomfortable shirt youll ever wear you will buy it wear it once and most likely never again,0
very nice look and pricebe advised they are matte not shiny finish,2
looks ok but a bit small,1
i have had pain in my ankle knee and arch due to an injury so i need to select my shoes carefully these shoes are great for daily use shopping or just walking around town for long walks however i would still need to wear hiking shoes as these do not have enough arch support for prolonged walksbr br prosbr they look stylish enough for daily wearbr these shoes required no breaking in period they were comfortable from the get gobr good valuebr fit as expectedbr br consbr not enough support for long walks for me as i have had an injury it is probably fine for most people though,2
alas family has outgrown tradition of matching pjs,1
great fit,2
i really wanted to like this product i love the color the material and the length but the ruched butt does not look at all how it does in the pictures its much too noticeable and weird looking still debating if i should return them or not,1
i bought two sets of these for my husband and he loves them soft comfortable and true to size,2
the fabric was beautiful but the dress was very ill fitting its made for a tall girl with a long waist im short waisted and it looked ridiculous,0
the color was really off from the picture the colors were not vibrant very disappointed in product material cheap would like to return but missed window to return,0
cute and handy,2
sound bot was very comfortable wide looks just like picture but on the inside for the hat were the sound is located fell apart was not useful at all honestly dont waste your money,0
material was 34costumey34 too silky and too shiny so i returned it,1
these didnt last long side arms are very thin and bent easy made the glasses unwearable within a week or two the looked cute just wish they were better made,1
really gorgeous bag but the world needs to figure out that there are actually people out here who own smart phones that are not i the pocket tooooo small for any other,1
i bought a size xxl 18 and it was way too small i gave it to my daughter who is usually a size 12 and it was a little tight on her but she wants to keep thembr br they are cute and stretchy i just wish the sizing was correct the label on the jeans does say 18 so its not like they sent the wrong size,0
its cute and can hold a little bit on the zipper side i can put a small treasure like ring or headphones but i would not put something heavy,2
they are cute but they are so small totally didnt look this small in the pictures i bought them to give as a gift so i dont know how they wear etc but wow just tiny,1
the shirts arent horrible but they are poor quality one of them had two decent sized holes in it before i even put it on and if you stretch the material even slightly around the area they start ripping way more i bought a set of these shirts from a different brand around the same time last year and they are all in perfect condition i only bought from this company because they had the color i wanted but i can tell a big difference in the quality of material and they were the same price,0
definitely not water proof,1
not a yellow person but the yellow orange color was so pretty i decided to order i sized up so it would be long enough to wear with leggings i was worried it would be to boxy but it wasnt it has a nice somewhat flow with the extra length,2
i got these for my mom as a gift they are cute not too thick,2
not what i expected fits a little big,1
very weird fitor maybe its me but i doubt it way too small and smushy,0
if the pants could be buttoned they would be great nice material love the expandable waist but due to poor design the button hole to fasten the fly is too small thought it was just one pair so returned the first pair and ordered another pair same problem design would have been better if a hook was used,0
the nike swoosh logo seems to be bit crooked on the right side and on the left side hard to see in picture it was cut off a bit this was how i got it out of the box pros i like the hat material though so i left 3 stars but the logo is a bother to look at not sure if this is happening to other hats or i was just unlucky,1
look and fit great,2
would have loved to order as separates bottom perfect but top im 36c too large medium would have been too small and im pretty equally proportioned,1
the packaging to the style of the tie clasps was classy in my opinion there is versatility to be used with these when wearing a suit and i am happy to have purchased these highly recommend,2
i ordered a size d umm i dont know what they are calling a d cup but it couldnt have been bigger than a b cup at best disappointed,0
the wife loves them the waist is a little big,2
this is a pretty bracelet i just dont happen to love rose gold it is pretty cool looking though,1
ok so first of all be ready for an enormous bag i thought i would use for work and um no this is more like a carryon bag for an airplane or a weekend trip i looked at the measurements bc i was specifically looking for a bag that would fit my 15 laptop this bag would fit three of my laptops and four days worth of clothes so regrettably i cannot use this as what i purchased it for right now it is in a closet waiting to be used for a trip somewhere it could potentially be a beach bag im bummed about it bc its a cute bag love the green and the stripes just enormously too big for what i was expecting maybe that was my bad i dont know,1
like it,2
i wear a size 13 shoe and these are quite difficult to put on once on they do their job well,1
not bad but almost looks brown from the distress rather than grey which black leather should look like when distressed,1
to thin,0
love the style live the color love the fitbutthe edges are horribly sharp i had to use a metal file to try to file down the edges and not cut myself not easy to do on a small ring that twists the rings seemingly arent being tumbled to remove the raw cut edges before being polished and finished super cute but yikes dont give it as a gift unless youre going to file it down first,1
the white part of these sandals are sparkly which i was unaware of and the straps are thinner as is are the soles of the flip flops compared to my other reef sandals that are the same style disappointed with the differencescomfort level,0
it fits but tighter than i hoped i have a big head but figured this would be fine snugger than should be,1
love this shirt grunt style usually runs a little small though very light weight,2
great material wish i had sized down,2
this is the smallest crappiest shirt i have ever seenthis would not fit a very small person much less a 3 x its very cheap not happy with this at,0
while it did arrive promptly i was not expecting this i was thinking more a sweater it looks very cheap and is lightweight definitely wouldnt consider it a winter sweater tempted to return it,0
the size of these pants are too big even though the picture looks small but the legs are huge even in a small,0
looking to buy this product in additional colors,2
they run a size small so if youre a size 38 order a size 40 feels comfortable lots of pockets,2
would buy again,2
i should have read the reviews more carefully it mentions infinity scarf in the description and another reviewer had called it an infinity scarf it is not another reviewer had mentioned the bad smell and yes there is definitely a strong smell when you take it out i am keeping it because it is the exact color i need and i have not had luck in finding another in that shade it is soft not scratchy but it is not what i thought i was getting i have to take some of the responsibility for that as the reviews contradicted each otherbr br i will take more care next time,1
got this as a gift the three minidials are fake and only cosmetic as are the top and bottom control dials the watch lost three minutes in 24 hours its junk,0
beautiful but breaks easy,0
my husband loves these underwear hed definitely rather wear these than anything else ive gotten him,2
part of the shoe where the laces go into the holes is a raw edge and was already slightly frayed upon arrival we got these on sale but if we had paid full price id have sent them back the raw edge makes them look cheap i got an 8 my sons an 8 and these barely fit slightly tight but loosening up with wear overall ok but im sure ill be getting more from a diff brand before the season is over,1
sure is on the cheap quality side if youre looking for a french cuffed shirt thats white and you dont want it practically seethrough then dont buy this shirtbr br the material is very thin and it is so thin it is practically transparentthe shirt would be ok if you did wear an undershirt however i can tell you it looks cheap still,1
its a sticker on a base pin i returned them instantly,0
already had lint balls on it and was stiff material,0
necklace arrived out of packaging and with the clasp damaged it appears they tried to repair the claps and just twisted it shut,0
these are comfortable and stylish a great value,2
the top is baggy and shapeless i bought it to wear to an elementary school party and wanted a full coverage top this top is wider than it is longer and the sleeves are so wide but then have a cuff at the wrist so it looks odd like a peasant blouse the material is see through and so thin that i will need to wear an undershirt not like the picture worst part for me is that the black hearts are not faded and distressed like in the picture they are solid and dark i bought it for the distressed look,0
great quality shirt true to size as ordered received quickly very happy,2
they are cricked and extremely uneven and its not a weight distribution issue the metal is actually uneven anyone that has ocd like with pictures on the wall etc dont buy this its definitely not worth 25 whatsoever,0
fits perfect i got a 3x im busty 42ddd so i was a lil nervous i love it,2
wish i could return this i needed compression in my wrist area they are not tight enough to help the swelling in this area,0
felt very cheaply made and unlikely to last,0
have seen this one before other places and was really pretty with a mosaic look the one i received has 1 little spot of color,1
not that attractive,0
the spyglass itself is really small i gave it to my five year old to wear,1
the shoes were too tightnarrow very uncomfortable hard to even put on,0
its too stretchy,1
way too small if you have larger breasts great material and beautiful dress just wish it fit,1
service was fine the vendor was really interested in feedback i didnt care for the socks too many different textures that made them uncomfortable for me but if i was athletic id probably like them the different threads inside the socks to enable the different colors tended to get my toes stuck also again it seems like a find product if its what you need its just not what i needed for travel,1
super itchy the little string at the top was an ugly color should have been the same color as the lace or gold it was cute but i couldnt keep it on had to change halfway through the night from the irritation on my chest,1
im a girl i just use my husbans account i ordered medium in the navy blue its a cross between royal and navy blue im 52 145 athletic build small would have been to short its soft and has a little bit of bounce it is loose enough i may shrink it little,2
this is my replacement pair these are uber comfortable and affordable this site allows me to order wide without giving the gargantuan widths i find in the discount shoe places,2
i ordered this hat in olive and the color was perfect now if only it had not been all bent and shapeless when it arrived i wanted to wear this hat pork pie style and it will take a lot of steaming and curling to get it into shape i am disappointed but if you want a hat that has a lot of character random and prolly not your own this is the hat for you,0
as advertised,2
i like the case the zipper is very lightweight and comes apart separates not unzips,0
these shorts are comfortable but short the padding seems good upon opening but when you put them on the padding doesnt exactly help with the boys the legs are short and could use some sort of silicone or similar to keep the legs down better yet make longer legs all in all not bad but only a long ride will give me conclusive answersbr br edited 4182019br after riding several miles in these shorts ive found that they are definitely in need of a longer inseam as well as other improvements a representative from baleaf reached out after my initial review to address my concerns and was very prompt in replying to my emails the customer service they provided was excellent and while the product may not have worked for me they refunded my purchase price without my asking and with no hesitation based on this level of service i wont hesitate to try another of their products,1
i love this watch its the perfect size shape and color but after several months of wearing it about threefour times a week the rose gold band is wearing down so that it looks kind of brown i still wear it but this is exactly what the price point dictates for quality of material still recommend so long as you understand you get what you pay for,1
i bought the black color and didnt like the fabric maybe other colors are better i dont recommend the black one,0
not the best quality returned,1
too small for me,1
suit came as described it fit perfectly and was packaged well,2
i am a size 4 i ordered a large because i wanted to get loose fit oddly enough i found it not lose this is strange for a large on a size 4 i suggest you order up up up,2
very seethru,1
i almost fall on my butt every time i wear these when the ground is a little bit slick the solesgrip on these shoes wore down so so fast,1
i do like it the problem is that it hasnt been a month and maybe because of the extremly use they have started to lose their blueness the easily get scratched so those are the reason but considering the price ofcourse i say they were okay,1
very sheer and shows too much wear a slip,0
expectations i purchased this for a halloween costume for the price i paid my expectations were i would have something suitable for a costume but not halloween store cheesycheap i did not expect a work worthy quality piece of clothingbr size l or 1012 ordered an xxl fit fine through shoulders and arms which was a relief as my arms are usually a problem spot for me although i have slender shoulders was able to button but barely could not wear with anything thicker than a thin camisole underneathbr pros cut and style are attractivebr cons the material is very thin and see through not at all the structure and thickness you would expect from a blazerbr final thoughts despite the thin cheap material and lack of structure i would order this in the next size up if it were available for the price and for my purposes costume it would have worked,1
good and strong,2
im 56 155 lbs and a dd cupbr br the dress i ordered was a size large but it fit very snuggly around my waist back and bust i am going to return it nice quality material overall a really cute highquality dress im bummed,2
i expected it to run small but wow and hand pockets are borderline useless i tore through one on the first child morning im going to try a larger size to see if it helps if not its still good outside of duty purposes,0
good quality good value helpful for leg cramps,2
nice leather hard to reverse belt from black to brown without tool to unsnap buckle,0
sooo cute gets tons of compliments its really soft and actually pretty good quality better than i was expecting,2
i have been needing another down coat since my previous long down coat has gotten so old i can not get much warmth from it anymore and it keeps tearing lets take a look at this onebr br what is this likebr colorbr the color of this is gorgeous it is what i would call this a bright metallic wine color it is way nicer than expectedbr br thickness of paddingbr this is way thicker than i expected it to be after reading that this has mostly down i figured it would be thin much to my excitement after opening the package up the coat kept expanding until it was just as i wanted it to be thick enough to be very warm but thin enough not to be overstuffedbr br stylingbr this has a great style to it it is plenty big enough to wear something under it for the most part more on that in a minute it is long enough to keep upper legs warm yet cover the upper body toobr br zippersbr the zippers are metal and need a bit of zipper lubricant or wax and they will function even more smoothlybr br side gussetsbr this has two side gussets that open up if you happen to either have a large sweater underneath or if you are pregnant it zips from the bottom hem up to the armpit area and opens the coat a couple of inches each sidebr br sleeves issue 1br my problem is this coat runs a bit tight in the sleeves if you plan to wear a sweater under this and do not have very thin arms this might be too tight on you i ordered a size up than normal i usually wear l and got an xl and the upper arms are still rather tight fittingbr br snap out areabr near the zipper in the front is a snap open area that also makes the coat a bit bigger around when shut it has a pleat appearancebr br hood issue 2br the hood is lined with black nylon it is slick and there is no way to make it smaller as in ties or snaps the best solution is to have a scarf to tie around it it is on the larger side although it does have a snap back cuff which you have to fuss with a lot at the top to keep the hood from being too far into your facebr br pocketsbr there are two zipper pockets on either side of the front the pockets are plenty big enough to warm hands or put gloves into when in stores etc they are lined in the surface fabric not fuzzy fabric there are no inner pocketsbr br no hanging loop issue 3br this is a big one for me i want to have loops inside my coats to hang them on it allows them to hang on hooks or pegs more easily this for some weird reasons has no hooks or labels to hang the jacket from so i have,2
me gusto mucho encajo en mi cuerpo perfectamente,2
nice,2
it is thin for a military style jacket but most of all make sure you buy one size up,1
one earring came without a post to put into your ear,0
ordered the smallest size and it was too big and frumpy on me had to return,0
these run small a size 10 is more like a size 8 12,1
they just dont look right too large,1
i cant believe that the quantity was such horrible it was just second time of wearing it and it was broken definitely will never ever buy it,0
one bead fell off days after i received them i managed to reattach but they both got discolored over a few months definitely not real rose gold the posts are also crazy long these are in the trash now dont waste your,0
cute but broke right away,0
i just received a pair of these for the first time they seemed to fit perfectly but after taking a few steps i noticed that with each step my foot would slip toward the heel incrementally until after 15 steps or so there was an inch and a half of sole above my toes they fit perfectly but will not stay on my feet additionally they are very hard and the heel is very firm which caused some pain also when you order these from the healing sole website and want to return them they will charge you 800 shipping 8 bucks to send them and 8 bucks to return them my vionic flip flops are much more comfortable since they have the arch support but dont have the hardness i can see the logic in having a rocker bottom in the healing sole for the stretch it gives the plantar fascia but the hardness is very difficult to overcome i just cant keep these on my feet,0
only problem was the way it stored disappointed with rolled up tight in plastic back for,2
i was so sad when my upper arms didnt fit i loved the lace and how pretty the profile on it i knew it was a rick to buy something with a 34 sleeve its pretty just not on me,1
good price for a celtic cross,2
i wish these shoes would have fit my feet because they are constructed well and have good arch support i have a narrow foot and ordered narrow width the shoe was much too wide in the toe box area and front of shoe i even checked the inside of the shoe to make sure it was indeed narrow,1
very cheap looking,0
good product for the price,2
when going by the size chart it said my son was a size m 78 so thats what i ordered but these pjs are swimming on him theyre huge although theyre very nice and well priced ill just set them aside and maybe hell be able to wear them in 23 years maybe 1 year if he has a monumental growth spurt,1
cute but broke on the first day it was worn,0
cannot adjust the nose bridge probably missing partsbr will return to amazon,0
these are womens narrow toe order half sizeone size up lightweight and looks great will have to test out soon in rain and hikes,1
i guess i will have to hopefully get it altered it is a beautiful dress but thier sizing is off ordered a 16 was just a bit to small so got an 18 and thats even small except for bust and lenth,1
run a little big only does a fair job at best of keeping my 16 month old granddaughter hands warm if super cold or actually playing outside for more than 1015 minutes i usually put 2 pairs on,1
this flannel shirt is very well made true to size bob loves the shirt says it is very warm has held up being washed in laundry mats while he is on the road gives him moving room in it great shirt bob is wearing a shirt underneath i hope this has helped thank you,2
i bought this for my wife for a birthday present and they are much smaller than average size you buy if you wear a large then buy an xl because these wont fitbr they will ride up really bad also so that is annoying for the wearer,1
i like the cap but i thought the inside would be satin i wear it on top of my scarf,1
hese are good yoga pants but arent the ones shown the ones that were sent to me have subtle thick horizontal lines and are somewhat seethrough also i was very keen on not wanting the vertical hem line on the outside leg trim and these came with the stitch line from hip to pant bottoms i really dont care for them,0
i ordered a size up as suggested in the description when i tried the product on it came down way past my waist i am keeping it because of the price but i wont be able to wear it out to dinner dates or other noncasual events,1
comfortable and they are ideal for work shoes but not make you hot like the non cotton ones do,2
no supportbut very cute on,2
it fits perfectly fine,1
i loved the picture it look like it would fit tailored but it did not it was tight across the top of my back and in the arms like it was an irregular item i ordered two different sizes to see which would work best and neither gave me the look i was going for but i really loved the look but just didnt fit like the picture im 57 and slim so it was not tailored at all and to long for my liking i was hoping for it to cover my bum and it did but way too much it could almost be a dress,0
fits rather big,1
if youre expecting to get what you see in the picture youre going to be utterly disappointed its fking orange its bright orange and grey and not that beautiful light soft brownblonde you think its going to be they even changed the picture i see too many disappointed reviews ey so disappointed and you know they get a fk ton of sales because the picture is a lie its false advertisement,0
the light that comes in the thru the large gaps on both sides creates a very pronounced star glare across the inside of the lens,1
yeah the shirt looks nice and all and im sure its of the highest quality fabric but 230 for a shirt i could buy a whole years worth of clothing at that costbr br i gave it 2 stars and not 10 because of the fact that its probably a really nice shirt and i love the design but god that is expensive,0
great little purse but zipper broke after just a month of use,1
great look,2
nice looking band but it scratches easily,1
not even close to the reader powerbr a lense attached inside from a regular readerbr no gobr not a quality product,0
fits perfect looks exactly like picture will be ordering more,2
if you want to add some pretty bling to an outfit this is the way to go these arrived just in time for my daughters 22nd birthday and she and her best friend were thrilled they are pink and blue which are their favorite colors and they wore them with dresses and no other jewelry since they are rather large and our showcase peace themselves they glittered beautifully in the evening light and in the theater they received many compliments theyre quite heavy and solid and come in a small velvet pouch they dont look gaudy if you wear them the right way and these young girls know how to dress now i did receive these earrings at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review and opinion of them and in my opinion they deserve the five stars great price point and pretty earrings if for any reason i have a need to change my review i will come back i do so,2
these are really cute but they run small i ordered a 6 because i normally wear a 55 and these just barely fit the sole is a little padded and the strap is soft very cute just order a size up,2
they were a gift,1
this is the cheapest cap i have ever seen if the material was any thinner you could see through it very flimsy disappointed,0
shipped on time and the product looks great easily fits an adult,2
i ordered an xl because i saw one rating say that they run small once receiving them and opening them i automatically thought they feel very thin and cheap i wear a m and they were still too tight i asked for a refund and they told me i could keep them gift them to family or they would give me a partial refund i would not do business with them i regret ordering these,0
it was too long if it was a little shorter i would have liked it better,1
love the colors but the fit is not true to size it appears in the picture to have more flare at the hips than it actually has,1
the color of the item is totally different as displayed,0
i ordered a red belt and received blue item description even stated red on order form belt is also kind of an itchy material for a child i am happy i was able to get my money back,0
the first tip i tried i lined it up perfect and it broke it didnt snap off just the slightest pressure and it fell off,0
one side of the band kept unhooking from my watch i wound up throwing it away,0
the slippers were just what he wanted but the opening to put your foot in was too small no stretch for a l slipper,0
seems to be made of good quality but the milkman wording is sooooo off center will return and try order once more but if the problem is corrected ill buy elsewhere,0
love this coatvery warm nicely made long sleeves fingertip length just right even though pockets are not zippered they are deep enough to put things onto them wo worrying they will fall out when sitting down one thingbi must say is sizing is way offcut small the measurements are of the coat not your body my old coat was a large w a chest measurement of 50 in this coat size is a xxl w same measurement not too happy to order 2 sizes larger but it fits perfectly always check sizing,2
videoidff3c024fc86b7e2b4c538824602d785d this watch is not safe my daughter loved this watch until one day it got extremely hot and made a high pitch squeal and would not respond to any inputs we were able to remove the back and jiggle the attached battery to stop the sound and unfreeze the screen and promptly turned it offbr br i contacted amazon who tried to have me remove the battery but it is soldered on and cannot be removed because it had been more than 30 days i could not get a refund i then emailed lols customer support and they emailed me a number to call after 47 minutes on hold i hung up i emailed customer support again asking for my money back and was told i could try if it had been less than 30 daysbr br my daughter who paid for the watch is devastated,0
one of my grandsons turned two this week and he loves bob marley music this is a nice quality t shirt he should get a year or so out of depending on growth thanks,2
cute jumpsuit for the price the pleating under the chest is a little weird but not super noticeablebr br my only complaint is that the color on the site is misleading i ordered the one labeled teal which looks to be a greenish color as you can see from my pic its definitely not green in any way maybe i was just sent the wrong one but its definitely more of a bluegray color still pretty just not what i was expectingbr br im usually a small ordered this in a small and it fit great,2
a good quality and value however the bottom of the pants are wide and emphasized that im short and fat i wish they would had tapered they taper in the picture very disappointed sent them back,1
bad smell left outside 4 days may return no information company,0
im pretty disappointed in this bench aside from how it looks online and the fact that there are no logos on it i have nothing good to say about it first it took forever to be delivered then when it finally arrived i opened it and saw that the cushioning was damaged it smelled very strong and awful the quality of this bench is probably the worst ive ever seen for workout equipment the board for the backing of the cushion is so incredibly thin that i could bend it so easily and likely break it i wouldnt even sit on the ends that dont have the metal support directly under it its simply not safe,0
awesome and my son is very happy,2
ok but smaller than i expected and did not seem like typical filson quality still nice though,1
scratched lovely design but not only did it take quite some time to arrive it showed up with a large noticeable scratch along the main gem as well as smaller not so noticeable ones surrounding it after closer inspection not even gonna hassle with trying to return it and wait for a new product very unfortunate i would not recommend,0
returned we gave these on a test run on a warmer winter wisconsin day and our feet were still very cold with the dial set to high,0
very cheap and fell apart quickly my poor daughter bought for me for christmas all her hard saved up money was wasted,0
seriously elite jersey,2
this is the thinnest and most garbage felt i have ever seen this hat is junk do not waste your money it looks nothing like the photo this is laughable and shame on this seller for misleading customers you are a thief,0
broke off the post my first time putting them in,0
i have a few vostok watches and i bought a variety of aftermarket bezels for them i cannot get this bezel to fit any of my vostok watches while other bezels fit straight on easily there appears to be a manufacturing tolerance issue with this bezel,0
these are greatbr perfect fit comfort design and material i love that the straps dont hug my neck i was specifically looking for wide straps that didnt show around my neck line and i was looking for something that was comfortable these completely fit the billbr note i do not wear them for running they are simply part of my casual wear,2
i love white cotton pants but these were too full for daily wear,1
love the look but it was either too big or too small depending on how you wrap it wish it was just a normal size,1
love love love i wear it daily with a stainless stellar watch at work im a guy so its perfect,2
wife loved them,2
mittens are warm but string broke on day 1,0
these socks were wonderful i bought them at the last minute to have an extra pair of socks for a ski trip and i ended up regretting not buying more they stayed dry and comfy even when my ski boots were not i tend to get frustrated with even the smallest thread or change in texture under my toes but these are well made and feel seamless to wear next time i go skiing ill be buying more of these because none of my other socks compare,2
these are cute and fit as expected got my usual size nice material took awhile to receive but worth the wait,2
the sleeves are too tight on my arms and i was expecting a cotton blend fabric its polyester and not stretchy or breathable its super cute otherwise so apple shapes with thin arms will love it,1
cute hats for reasonable price my 18 mo who doesnt like anything on her head doesnt want to take this hat off definitely a good buy for summer,2
look nothing like the photo arrived in a bag so they were smashed to crap do not buy,0
its very fit for me i real love it,2
huge it cotton very thick fabric,0
very comfortable and look nice,2
expected better quality,1
i bought this trying to buy more from us and this clearly says made in vietnam will be returning,0
these need to come in different sizes it isnt large breast friendly,0
great gift,2
these socks are weirdly tight and uncomfortable around the toes never had this problem with any other brand of socks before,0
the pin had most of the flag cut off of course what was shown in the picture the gray on the top and bottom are almost non existent,0
purchased this item to try out on my sunglasses and prescription glasses product is two molded rubber pieces with a throughandthrough hole the rubber down arm as seen in the picture is very soft rubber and basically does not add to retention the individual pieces have yet to fit on any of my collection of eyeglass frames i almost lost one due to the loose fit in others too tightbr since the down arm is merely soft rubber eyeglass retention is dependent up rubber friction of the stem attached pointsbr simply winding a rubber band around the stems would give the same resultsbr i dont recommend this product,0
beautiful bag not big enough,1
standard issue,1
cute but the tail was held in with a single stitch and fell off right away,1
48 in strings were actually 46 in,0
it looked as though i had wrapped a piece of black gauze around my waist totally see through very disappointed,0
very nice shirtsgrandsons loved them,2
comfortable,2
not one size fits all too loose for under a helmet,0
these pants are very soft and comfortable they are a little shorter than i would like for them to be i am 5634 and they just barely come to my ankles perfect for working out in but i probably wont wear them out much,2
i ordered the light flowered blouse it has nice silky material and doesnt cling to your bottom im short 52 and hanging around 210 lbs seriously how the heck does that weight gain happen anyway ive gone up to size 3x and that is what i ordered it was a little small next time ill order the bigger size unless i lose 10 15 lbs lol i hope this is helpful go ahead and buy it you really will be glad you did,2
they look fantastic while wearing them unfortunately mine also broke the flowery ring off while i was sleeping in them the filigree portion is simply too thin to stand up to major use but they are great for a special occasion or a night out,1
the biggest thing with me is that the shoes are hard to get on after putting the laces in because you can loosen them so much they are good quality and the colors are what i wanted but i think i prefer regular laces,1
good for the price,2
love the material im short and petite so i had to hem it some but it was perfect fit my event,2
the material was not comfortable,0
nice,1
sorry but like what are these because they are not adult yoga pants they look like theyre made for children the material is not very stretchy and feels like sandpaper maybe ill use them to clean my floors or as a dish rag lol awful awful awful,0
the flaps dont seem to work my glasses still fog up i like the color,1
it is very comfortable and fits loosely as i wanted cant beat the price,2
broke within hours of putting it on my key chain,0
did not receive item as discribed,0
shirt i received is nothing like shown this material is really strange and it feels like a really thick childs bathing suit it is really wide and really short like you should be 3 feet tall horrible purchase,0
arrived in a timely fashion well packaged made of quality materials im very happy with my purchase,2
my first time to ever order leggings online and i was very happy when i got them they are so soft and smooth and i saved at least 3 by ordering these instead of this pair from a boutique i shop with i am 56 and weigh around 200 i also currently 23 weeks pregnant and they come up over my belly they do feel a bit tighter around my legs than i would normally expect so im hoping they just need a little 34breaking in34 only giving 4 stars for now as i have only tried them on once since receiving them,2
look great,2
i ordered larger due to reading reviews the fit ended up being too large the material is silky and not flattering fit is also not flattering color is as expected,0
ok,1
very comfortable but at a cost to quality the denim material is much thinner than the ones we have bought in past from various sources we buy 4 to 5 pairs at a time to spread the wear after multiple washings they will start to rip around the back pockets,1
my husband loves these shorts and they were a great value for the money he wears them frequently they look better than basketball shorts and are super comfy,2
okay piece,1
was expecting closer to a sweater fabric its more like a thin t shirttable cloth from dollar store,0
this is my new favorite top purchased it 4 months ago and still looks like new it doesnt hold wrinkles hasnt faded washes and drys well this top has some stretch but doesnt loose its shape i purchased a large which fit perfectly with a little bit of room in the waist area i have wide shoulders 5434 tall 34c 145 pounds i am short waisted and it fits perfect in the length if you are tall you may want to look at the lengthi think it is around 2634 long hope this helps,2
lenscovers sunglasses wear over prescription glasses size medium blue polarized size medium is a bit large for my face but small wasnt available and its hard to tell even when the measurements are in inches thank you nice blue frames smoke lenses are great for days when you need to cut the sunlight back a bit and we have a lot of those i prefer wraparound sunglasses to clipons because theyre easier to put on and take off the drawback is that they take a lot of room in my purse,2
not flattering at all very short does not cover belly,0
had to have surgery and this was comfortable and kept my back covered with those bare backed hospital gowns,2
shoe looks nice just hurt my small toe,1
its alright for the price i sized up to a large per the other reviews and it fits everywhere but the legs they are super tight i bought it for a trip so im just gonna make it work but if you are heavier in the bottomleg area i would try another suit,1
theyre ok and i wear them when i need a sock that goes above my ankle but im not crazy about them theyre thin and and just dont feel great on my feet i wont buy them again,1
good for a few uses than the stitching will fall apart after a few hand wash just very thin material,0
the tassel portion of these earrings are of very poor quality the yarn used is very thin,0
the belly ring is pretty the color is purple and not blueishpurple like the picture shows the description didnt mention to remove belly ring before bathing and swimming because it did tarnish,1
this thing is so comfy and cool my son and wife tried stealing it from me during our trip definitely worth the money,2
my pleasure,2
was looking for solid color for a long time the navy is perfect like material and length would buy again but not in black the black fabric was heavier and felt very different than the navy i sent it back i would try another color however because i liked the fit,1
as far as flats go these look ok but theyre very comfortable the color and fit were exactly as expected and the leather is soft and good quality however the toe part of the shoe hangs over the rubber sole just enough that it scuffs very easily with just normal walking after wearing only a few times the toe of both shoes are scuffed and scratched and already look very wellworn so while i like the fit and comfort i wouldve liked a little more durability,1
the slippers were long enough but they run narrow even the small elastic in the side didnt help i dont have wide feet so this was a surprise,1
great if you plan on just doing reading outside bad if you plan on doing activities ouside that you do not need constant readers,1
finally found the perfect leggings and theyre yoga pants br soft and practical with the pocketseven holds my phone without pulling down the pants,2
i loved the look of these necklaces and wore them for a couple of weeks when i started to notice my neck was super itchy the morning after i realized i was starting to get itchy i woke up with irritation bumps around my entire neck that lasted for a week it was very painful and itchy i will never ever wear these necklaces again the necklaces gold color wore off very quickly good for a night or two of wear but wouldnt risk the rash,0
it was great but shrunk in the washer which is weird because we wash our clothes in cold water,1
nice dress,2
this sweater was so cute on my little guy it was great for christmas,2
works for what i wanted but other people said it ran small and they mustve corrected themselves by then ok quality,1
great fit,2
i like the fact that this bra comes with extenders because i definitely needed them because it seemed really small therefore i recommend ordering a size up,2
ordered this because its very difficult for me to find cute strappy sports bras that fit properly and i was hoping the clasp back would be the ticket im a 32d and a medium was too large around width wise a medium would probably fit a 3436 34cups34 were definitely way too small for a d cup but given its a sports bra i didnt really expect them to fit like a regular bra straps on this one were shorter than a different color and strap orientation of the same 34brand34 which was good for me being 5234,0
good price and quality,2
the material felt cheap and looked even worse its like a jean look printed on fabric,1
i got a large an it fits me like a m i have read a few other comments with this same problem so if you order this product get the next size up not sure if i can return it or not do to it being clothing this is the reason why it gave it 2 stars an now after having it for about a year the pattern is coming off,0
reviewed by my wife this is a good quality pair of pants which is what ive come to expect from lees over the years the fit is relaxed and comfortable,2
good quality shirt i bought it for a friend and he loved it i ordered black and it fit him well,2
good quality fits well,2
beautiful colors and patterns and v soft to touch,2
this is a super cute and flattering dress can be worn with boots and a jacket or alone with summer shoes it fit true to size for me,1
ordered xl and could not even get one arm and my head in the top of the dress ridiculous,0
i prefer carhartt sweatshirts due to their superthick fabric and excellent durability and gladly pay the premium price unfortunately these tees are only slightly thicker than the amazon essentials version and much thinner than walls work wear dissapointing,1
they looked very nice in the picture which made me purchase them i like how they feel they run a little big and when i walk they get caught on the carpeting so that is very annoying i also noticed that they were very easily the fabric on the foot area is starting to give away and i dont wear these every day i can tell that theyre wearing poorlybr wow they look really good and they are soft they dont wear very good and they are very awkward your feet slide forward i would not buy again,1
love my party pink crocs i have a party on my feet,2
for 7 cant beat this shirt it rivals the 10 ones at target and kohls enjoy,2
needed some new ones went with a splash of color,2
bottoms are same width front and back,0
comfortable and soft perfect although not made for workout running etc 32dd,2
kept slipping down not as soft as i wanted,0
doesnt matter what size it roles up or it rolls down,0
i love this shirt i almost never find shirts that are a womans cut and fit so well,2
i am waist 31 and the l does not fit,0
the undershirt and lace are only joined at the side so the bank of the shirt and front of the shirt fits weird,1
loved these exactly what i was looking for thank you,2
bought for a family photo not the worst thing ever but definitely needs a belt for those with a few extra curves like i do,0
i like this band as its more elegant than most apple watch bands handy when im wearing a dressy outfit however the clasp is pretty difficult to work with im not sure id have gotten it if id known that,1
these now cost 35 more than when i first started purchasing in 2016 inflation i get it but 10 per pair is steep for the characteristic poor longevity these are my favorite winter sock warm dry fast comfortable all day the problem is they dont last long unless maybe you hand wash but they are socks after all no one is about to do that so they end up lasting 2 years for me before holes form i have about 1215 pairs in rotation at any given moment so they get worn maybe 15 times a year during the coldest days thats just 30 wearswashes before they need to be retired thats not greatbr br so i came back to order more and i see the price increase is extreme and the product quality looks exactly the same ive tried other variants of their socks and they too have the sort lifespan issue ever single one less wool same 30 wear life its practically part of the brand at this point im not sure i want to keep going with people socks since the value just isnt there any more,1
cute lightweight thin and easily foldable unfortunately this isnt waterproof,0
cheap fabrics,0
arrived on time we looked at many many many luggage sets after comparing the various features we settled on ferge im not familiar with this brand but it was a great purchase after we opened the amazon outer box we found that the interior box had been damaged on a corner piercing and crumpling the entire corner this gave me concern after opening the inner box we found only a scuff in that area the three hardshells came nested well packed and wrapped no problems so far the wheels are nice sturdy and roll smoothly the zippers are tight as they zip and the cases lay neatly on the provided feet when necessary i am impressed with the quality my daughter leaves for europe tomorrow and when she returns we will have a followup review,2
true to size nice hoody,2
this tank top is huge i am short but not small i normally would get a large but ordered a medium based on reviews it was enormous so i exchanged it for a small it was still too big i think the cut was intended to have the fabric drape but the material was a little too thick to properly drape it just tented out in the least flattering way,0
looks clunky lots of metal you see more metal than you do diamonds i took it to my jeweler who confirmed it was incredible value definitely better than they could give me it just didnt sparkle like a diamond bracelet should i ended up purchasing a differentmore expensive bracelet with better diamond clarity and less metal this really made a difference one more thing the links were very stiff some of them were stuck together and you had to manually move them i imagine that over time things would loosen up but at the same time this isnt something most people would wear everyday,0
product seem used delivered with what seems to be dirt marks all over,0
stupid,0
absolutely lovely its similar to an expensive ring i saw in the jewelry store,2
pink is alot brighter than expected,0
it is not a true large,1
its a nice hat if it fit my head id give it 5 stars its probably ok for up to size 714 maybe 712 but if you have an xl head like i do keep looking there is a snapback for adjustment but the crown isnt big enough for anything larger than 712 even if you leave the adjustable back completely open disappointed but they are nice enough that i gave them to my hubby they fit his size m head,1
a very well made bag it did take me a few tries to figure out how to make the straps go into back pack mode a little hard to get into sometimes but lots and lots of pockets i love having the back back option when walking around,2
not the deminsions stated in the ad,0
excellent,2
too thick for florida weather in my opinion but will wear when it cools down,2
sizing is totally off as if they were womens shoes being sold as mens,0
this was way too sheer and flimsy the lining was mad out of the same sheer material as the dress so you would be exposing yourself if you didnt wear anything underneath i do not suggest purchasing unless you are using something else as a liner,0
its cutebut it came crushed looks like its been ran over and wadded up in a ball the bow is all scraggly,0
this is not what the picture looked like very gaudy not happy with items will donate it,0
its always a nightmare trying to find jeans that fit and it seems when i find a style that works levi goes ahead and discontinues them i really like this version and plan on ordering more,2
the cooling effect is noticeable and a welcome relief from the bermuda sun when i am cycling and playing golf the orange was not as vibrant as i wanted as it does not match my golf shirts or cycling kits but they do provide the protection i was expecting,1
the black covering is a see through mesh i am nearly 70 years old i dont need a see through top thats why i bought this otherwise it is a very nice top,1
buttons are on the side,0
more like a nightgown,0
photos online are a bit puffier when i received it it was thin i already spent over 300 on this not worth the money i wouldnt refer it to my friends and i wouldnt buy another one,0
bought this for my family reunion as we were assigned colors for each branch got tons of compliments on this cute dress fabric feels soft and comfy like a big tshirt and fit just as id hoped it would im actually honking of ordering it in different colors too,2
cheaply made smells of resin and the material resembles eva form theres blue marks on the shoe as if it was touched by a maker or someone careless with paint i think im sending it back,0
im thinking they are too small because they keep sliding down its either that or the kind of material,1
likesbr br my wife says they dont make me look like a farmer apologies to farmers as do my othersbr they are unique looking and stylishbr br consbr br 1 they dont stretch so they are more likely to pop off with a sudden movebr im used to fabric suspenders and when i first removed them from my shoulder the rigid leather pulled the bottom clasp off the pants i was careful after that and they stayed onbr br 2 they are thin and even though i kept adjusting them i couldnt keep the front straps neat the underside wasnt concealed by the top see my photobr br i usually wear the hold up brand these leather suspenders do have a place in my wardrobe i wont wear them for everyday use but they are unique enough to wear on a casual night out,2
does this run bigger or smaller than usual or true to size for reference i am 54 122 and 36d usually order large with no problems but you never know with sizing lol and i like my tops with some stretch not to clingy,2
the underwear fit perfectly and feel nice but the padding is not under the sit bones it is behind them the other baleaf underwear with the narrow waistband does not have this problem comparing the two the wide waistband doesnt fit any higher up than the regular waistband the only difference between the two is the location of the paddingbr br i will also say that the padding is thin it means you wont feel like you are wearing a diaper but it isnt as padded as the more serious padded shorts on long rides i wear mens shorts but i wear the baleaf the other version when am doing short rides or will have to walk around still wearing them,0
great slippers kids love them,1
this shirt could fit my small terrier dog not realistic at all i order a large thinking it would run small and it was a child small not happy about the product and it was cheaply made,0
took these with me to disneyland both my daughter and i used them for the rides i have prescription sunglasses and did not wish to lose them they worked great the only problem i had was when entering a shops or dark rides i had to remove my sunglasses which was not easy when these guys work so well hair pulling and difficulty removing but they hold your glasses on i can see these would be excellent for sports,1
amazing quality especially for the price my measurements are 443044 and i am 5 3 and 165 pounds i bought the large since i did not want it to be bodycon and i wanted to make sure it was long enough since i have a larger chest which tends to shorten dresses it came just above the knee it is very slimming with the belt without having to suck it in all night the material is thick too and not cheap feeling it is very soft but keeps its shape it is a very classy looking dress great buy,2
too large have to take to watch smith to have links removed but its a beautiful watch,2
i love it and the top fits good,2
these socks are shedding all over the houseeven after washing driving the wife crazy,0
this dress was supposed to be purple but ended up being fuchsia or magenta deep pink i was severely disappointed as i was to wear this to an event that required me to wear purple the dress was also too large and stretched out,0
i bought this hat for my son who was scrooge in his schools play the hat was not at all what i would consider a top hat my son looked more like heisenberg from breaking bad than scrooge i had to go to a local costume store and purchase another hat it was also a tight fit as well my son is 12 and does not have a huge head so i would say this hat is more for the 10 and under crowd,0
this is a great shirt for the price and the body of it is a great fit i bought it in two colors to wear with skirts and slacks the pockets and asymetric cut make the shirt more interesting and a little dressier under and around the arms is snug i always wash things before wearing and then only dry for a few minutes i wish i hadnt put this in the dryer at all when i wear it now i am tugging under the arm and around the forearm to try and stretch it out a bit am going to try a trick i read about soaking a garment in baby shampoo and warm water its supposed to relax the fibers in clothes so they stretch a little more im hoping it works as the one that shrunk in the arms is the black one that goes with just about everything i own,2
tags are solid and its withstanding after 1 trip steel wires an added feature where tag will be tied securely wish this had an option to insert my personal information say my business card or similar to emirates airlines tag where only name will be visible and rest of information will be hidden also what if everybody buy this or similar tag and tied on similar bags given 1 star less for the above thoughts if youre looking for just tag to identify buy it its solid and colorful tag and able to wash them as wellbr br i ordered this product on discounted price to test and provide unbiased review,2
these are very comfortable both for sports use and everyday use the fabric thicker and more stretchy than some other sports underwear which you may or may not like no fly which you also may or may not like price is great for what you get durability is a little disappointing though after several washings a couple of these have split at the seams either along the side or at the waistband im wearing the correct size and they arent very tight i rarely have this problem with other underwear also the waistband seems to pill up much more quickly than other brands of underwear,1
i got the black ones to go under my scrubs at work they work just fine and such but ive only had them for a short time and theyve faded quite a bit and dont dry them in the dryer unless its on low heat or just air they shrink like crazy,1
love it,2
the colors are pretty i usually wear a medium i order a large the large was too tight i needed an xlarge,1
i really needed this item to accept my daughters prom outfit when it arrived one of the stones was already missing it was too close to prom time to return it so she wore it anyway by the end of the night 4 more stones were gone,0
ive only had my band for about 6 weeks and the little rubber claspholder has already broken my first band i had almost 3 years before it broke and was worn out i ordered 2 so we will see how long it holds up,1
the shirts are nice and light and fit well under the arms unfortunately they are a bit short for me as i am 65 223 lbs i am rocking a smaller dad bod but most of the places they are tight is in the chest and shoulder areas they hang a little loose off my midsection but tighten up quite a bit as soon as it hits my lower chest they sent me a 3xl which i was luck they dis as i thi k a 2x may have been way too small,1
i was afraid that it would give me an infection but one year later and its very good,2
slippers were comfortable for about a week the soles are very thin with padding that flattened after about a week,1
has a weird shape and very cheaply made gonna throw it in the trash what a waste of money,0
cute but smaller than expected,1
the hat isnt true to size when returning item they charge you shipping even when receiving a free return label from amazon,0
these shoes are great so soft and comfy when standing for hours,2
such a good quality super soft and comfortable,2
fits good just dont throw it in the dryer or it will shrink,2
belt didnt arrive,1
these fit well but are fairly thin material,1
one size does not fit all thats just another way of saying we make just one size they slip down below my heals they come up just above my ankles which almost justifies the description of women above ankle not any higher as the photo shows im pulling up on them a lot because these are the colors i want ill keep them and deal with the slipping my pants cover the lack of height because i had hoped to have the ones in the photo i am disappointed buyer be aware,1
if you want this to fit right stick to your normal size i sized up because im overly blessed in the chest area but its too big quality is not great i knew it was a printed on design but the fabric is not great the fit is terrible not worth the price imho,1
i returned the dress because it was not really flattering,1
the door on it already broke and its always stopping and needing to be rewound up i would not get this again,1
as soon as i took these pants out if the package i could see that they were going to be too small some clothes at least look like they will fit but these i could see were not i liked how soft they were and that they looked comfy so i am disappointed,1
hella cute,2
the part is uneven to get the part in the center of my head i have to pull the wig to the left which makes it feel very uncomfortable while wearing if it wasnt for that i would say its a good wig,0
i already did a review of the umbrella some time ago what can you say about an umbrella except it keeps the rain off,2
did not realize the type of closure was not the traditional,1
this is absolutely adorable however the 5t dress is a shirt at best i would recommend the 5t for a 2 year old not a 4 year old,0
the damn thing was way to heavy to wearlet alone set it on my flimsy book shelflol but it seemed to be very well made,0
the band slips and needs to be adjusted too frequently looks great and good quality,1
fits small probably wont wear it out of the house but its okay as a type of robe,0
very heavy sweatshirt arrived with a hole in the sleeve,0
this fit nicely are adequately warm and look really nice especially during the fall and winter,2
so much better than stride rite i am now a momo fan,2
the top is more like a crop top and i ordered a large because i like pjs bigger and they fit like a medium like material and super comfortable though,1
cheap thin material super short arms and snug,0
these hats arent the same quality anymore just had to return two of the navy hats because the bill was stiched on crooked and the blue is really faded now used to be a solid navy,0
material as expected a little bit small,2
the quality and size is great but the color is way off its got more of a purple vibe then tancream which i didnt like,2
i lost the ends for the belt almost immediately and it is basically just a piece of elastic i would not buy it again,1
i dont like that i cannot get the hoop to close evenly and the double hoop pic is miss leading it looks like crap on,1
wellmade great fit and quality,2
this is my second order of the same item so i would say i am a satisfied customer great product and great seller,2
this is a lovely hat it was purchased for a luncheon where all were encouraged to wear a hat for the contest unfortunately i did not get to attend the luncheon it fits great,2
just ribbon attached to a metal clip not sturdy and even sewed to where the pattern is opposite when using it,0
well i bought these for the boyfriend he loves them they are comfy and everything until i get a phone call that how on earth is he supposed to use the restroom unless he pulls them 100 down id give a 5 star if that werent the case,1
the material is very soft,2
its ok,1
purchased as a gift and gentleman most pleased as it has pockets very warm and comfortable great value for price,2
i know this is an amazing tech suit have seen enough swimmers wearing it and know many that recommend i also know that tech suits are very hard to get on and must fit very snug tight i also know it takes a lot of time and effort to get it on that being said i ordered this suit according to speedos size chart for the lzr racer x i ordered a 22 for my daughter she has 3434 hips is 52 overall small but curvy in the hips she wears a size 20 in the speedo aquablade we tried a few times to get this suit on but there was no way we were gonna get it over her hips and yes we gave it sufficient time to get on we watched several videos on how to put it on and she got many tips from fellow teammates we expected it to be hard we have been in enough dressing rooms at competitions to see how girls struggle to get these suits on but this suit was not getting over her hips without damaging tearing the suit i think if your swimmer is not curvy more straight up and down this suit will work we will go to local swim shop and try on some other suits that may be better suited for her body type i only give this 3 stars bc of sizing the price online for this is amazing tho if you are confident in your size dont pass this up you wont find a price like this in your swim shop,1
tried these based on reviews and absolutely love these boxer briefs theyre extremely comfortable great elasticity thick quality material and affordably priced this is my goto brand for boxer briefs now,2
nice and warm,2
my son loved his costume selection very good quality he wears size 910 in clothing so i went with the xl and fits him perfect not too snug or too loose,2
while the sleeves are nice the quality is not,0
returned the shoe my nephew could not get his foot into the shoe unless he stepped on the back heel rather than mess up a shoe i returned it,0
strange my original review disappeared well made however just a tad too small was able to use some goop to snug up the seller attempted to bribe me to delete the original review,1
they are not as long as they look in the picture they fit my little girl but not me,1
this is my 2nd set of these bags i keep 4 in each car now they expand a ton so dont think they are too small before trying them machine wash them and they are great all 4 fit in my purse and i can get an entire cart of groceries in 3 or 4 new laws against plastic bags in stores made these a great find love them people at the store are amazed when they see how much they fit and the handles dont break like other bags,2
i received a european size 39 which is equivalent to us size 85 i wear a size 7 so these heels are way too large for me however i can comment on the style and construction the shoe is all peachrose gems on the exterior of shoe and in the open toe area its very glittery there is an ankle strap with 3 holes for adjustment the bottom of shoe measures 1025 inches the opening in front of shoe measures 3 inches it is not made of leatherbr br its a very cute pair of high heels it would be a dressy addition for prom or other formal event i couldnt find anyone with a 85 sized foot to comment on the comfort of the shoes though,1
this scarf was great quality for a good price very soft,2
perfect i love this swimsuit,2
did not give me the comfort i needed to work out in,2
this is a casual hat for shoving in your purse when rain is expected the crown is large so big hairdos will fit the hat has a type of bow accent on the back to distract from its plain style the hat is not water repellent and does not have a lining so do not linger in the rain without an umbrella the hat is thick and flexible so it can bend and be pinned to create a style i am going to keep it but will not buy another,1
the drawstring keeps coming out during a wash so i have to remind myself to tie them before throwing in the wash cycle not bad for the price though,1
very cute but unless you have a huge nose they look pretty ridiculous i had a few of them break while trying to put them in and i was very careful,1
my youngest daughters favorite suit looks nice futs good and washes nice,2
pleased with this thanks,1
it was a little big,2
it is a little boxy and too large for someone who is slim like me i use an xxs xs i do like the print a lot my sisters keep taking them so i keep ordering one for myself am not such a fan of the hans word on it on this one so though i like the one without it better,1
i didnt like the fabric too clingy use it to wear around the house,0
my granddaughter wont take them off comfortable and easy to walk with perfect fit,2
fits decent kind of tight though,1
cute top runs small shrinks when washed,1
i read quite a few reviews before purchasing this skirt none of the reviews mentioned how badly it wrinkles i followed the washing instructions and it still would need to be ironed after every wash there was a time when i was willing to do that that time is long gone dont believe anything you read in reviews,0
rugged nice price nice fit length seesm to be about 15 inch usa to long,1
absolute perfect fit super comfortable and supportive i plan on buying more,2
i have purchased several of these in various colors but this one is thinner than the others,1
smaller than expected,1
recieved wrong letter on necklace,0
the goodbr sleek designbr durablebr definitely made of aluminumbr storage for at least 5 cardsbr br the badbr i verified that it does not block rfid reading using a hid omnikey 5427br br this would be a 5 star product if they did not tout its ability to block rfid i ran two tests one with my chip cards debit and credit and the reader did not read anything without the wallet so i used my work id badge and was able to pull my employee number from my badge the second test i inserted the badge into the wallet and it could be read from either side,0
this is not a maxi length dress its more of a tea length hits between my knee and ankle very matronly looking to me i sent it back,0
a stich close to crotch area came loose without apparent reasons dont know how bad its going to get had to stich it up myself not a big deal but id rather not having to deal with it,1
i would like to have given this 4 or even 5 stars for price and cuteness but unfortunately the quality didnt cut it ours arrived with a hole directly in the crotch of the pants this outfit was so cute on and she loved it so or sucks here was a hole,0
bought these as a safety issue to wear on new hardwood floors to prevent slipping i didn t realize they were toe socks and the first time i put them on was a bit weird but after wearing them for a few minutes they were so comfortable i forgot that i had them on the grip is great keep me from slipping yet didnt interfere with normal steps,2
i always wear a large this fit like a tight medium that cuts under the armpitsbr what a waste of timebr i sent it back,0
i like for walking around,1
while i love the color and look of this jacket it didnt look good on me the waist hit at my hips and the sleeves were too long perhaps would have been perfect if i were 59 but i am 5 so i had to return it,2
change color quick irritated me,0
they were a bit hard to put in the shoes had to open up the holes with something first and then really push hard,1
watch works well looks nice but band is way too tight and leaves marks on my skin the description should have included measurements for the bracelet,0
quite disappointed i went up a size from the size charge so they wouldnt squeeze in my thighs and they squeeze the ever loving crap out of my thighs they also roll really bad,1
how can one be expected to purchase a pair of shoes if you dont tell us what the size is come on i looked and looked and looked i finally gave up as this was crazy making,0
it doesnt stick to my tongue,0
alot bigger than i imaged but thats my fault for not reading the dimensions the only problem i have with it is that the chain is flimsy it keeps on undoing im gonna need to get a different chain,1
stitching is already coming apart after just one week of use dont recommend,0
if you need shoe for a full day this is not the pair for you the zipper doesnt go up on one then the second shoe once you can get the zipper on and walk for 10 mins 2nd sandal takes a dump so if you want shoes for a full day look elsewhere,0
returned,0
the tshirt fit great good quality material that you could not see thru my daughter loved it,2
very comfortable fits great good price no slipping and sliding yet look like sneakers so they are versatile,2
not only was this gigantic but all they did was cut out the material and sew up the seams no finishing at all not even at the neck i have seen tents that were better made really a waste of money very disappointed,0
stands out,1
ordered a size 3x and they wont even fit my daughter who wears a medium up large dont waste your money,0
im not terribly impressed with this bag its fine but not as nice as the ebags i have purchased in the pastit almost appears like a pencil case i bought two bags for gifts and i chose the bright bluebut it is not the bright blue that is pictured it is a navy blue appearing almost black not really fun enough for a present im not going to bother sending it back but i wanted to share the information,1
the shorts are nicely constructed but fit a bit small,1
this dress was awful it not only showed my kentucky peach hanging out the bottom but wouldnt even fit over my cantaloupesbr its too small too thin too short no stretch and not comfortable cotton buyer be warned,0
runs 3 sz too small,0
cheap material that wrinkles easily will not order again probably best for smaller women who are below a 36c,0
this sticker is perfect for my car i know its not centered my son hit my hand as i was placing it and it stuck may order a new one and redo its perfect size to be seen and looks great go army hooah,2
fits good but the white is definitely see through,1
beautiful,2
i love love love this ring has just the right amount of sparkle to it its super sturdy will update if anything changes but i would say dont hesitate just buy it,2
loved it but broke the second time i wore it wouldnt recommend,0
i have been looking for a cute skort and this is it its comfy and has pockets,2
shorts are comfortable,2
the shoe is very tight using shoe stretcher hoping it can be worn even bought 1 size bigger and that didnt help,0
fit is on the large side but the colors are nice and bright and the suit is wellmade recommend,2
not for me,1
love my new sleepwear fast delivery and fits greatlight and comfortable perfect for lounging around the house i am 57170lb athletic build and purchased the large and its perfect,2
the waist band turn over weirdly after two swims it is not fixed properly inside the swimsuit fabic is nice though but having the band twisting all the time is a no no,0
bought a whole size up for my 3 yr old because lets face it they grow out of everything quickly and they said it fits true to size nope tiny they actually fit my 112 yr old i called in to see if it was a mix up and sent the wrong size no just poorly sized,0
this ring is very nice i was looking for a colorful and yet thin ring and this serves that purpose i look forward to the stainless steel to be very durable,2
the shoes are weak the quality is low,0
these are great boots but with a major flaw the footbed and support in these boots are awesome the support from ariat not so much three of the bootlace hooks pulled out of the leather within 4 months that is completely unacceptable in a 200 pair of boots these are my first and last pair of ariat laceups,0
cheaply made clasp broke the first week i had it,0
they definitely start to slide off of your hips and create a weird space in between your legs,1
great for a beachy look awesome case a little storage bag a cleaning cloth they feel very comfortable lightweight and well made i love the bright lenses against the dark frame and wood ear pieces overall a really cool set of shades get ready for compliments,2
entrega rápidabr es un poco pequeña en comparación a mis otras gorras,1
wouldve been great love the material and fit but the quality is bad the seams didnt hold and they just fell apart on the third wear,0
some pieces were broken,1
great over the calf compression sock with padded bottom which helps for standing and walking,2
great underwear fits more like compression shorts and they are longer than typical briefs but if you are expecting that these are great quality,2
three stars based on the followingbr i have worn sperry sandalsflops for 20 years or so they appeared to stop making the style i had worn forever i was looking for a similar pair to what i had as far as cushion support and thought these would meet those expectations i have known for years i liked the appearance but they turned out to be more of your run of the mill without the extra arch support i was used too i also felt the sizing was small compared to previous pairs again they looked good just not what i was looking for return process was easy,1
this is not a key ring i was badly deceived too small like a joke already requested refund badly disappointed,0
i got these for my boyfriend and he wore them to work and loved them he said they were very comfortable and they did stay up on his calf all day this was the first pair of socks hes had that have the arch support in them and he liked that too but didnt know if it actually made any difference or not for him his feet didnt get too hot either these feel like theyre well made with good quality materials he said he would definitely recommend these,2
i use this all the time to sell jewelry kind of cheap but it works,1
best quality watch band ive ever seen and for the lowest price ive ever found cant believe the value here ill be buying many more of these love it,2
product itself seems nice but way small mens large which i wear in everything just fine wont go past my thighs gave to my 13 year old and fit him fine,1
my daughter loves it and she gives it a 10 feels secure and soft on head,2
looks more like a mans shirt than a lab coat but it will work for my sons halloween costume,2
fit very well and stay on my 2 year old,2
comfy,2
i really really really wanted these to fit they didntbr too small and too narrowbr definitely size up at least one size,1
love everything about it,2
poor,0
floral print was diff and it just looked bad on me but the fit was great im 5 ft 11 and wear a 16 jeans ddd bra i bought xl and it fit good,1
they were too tight for me will probably fit if i can loose 2025 pounds,1
way to small not true to side,0
quality not on par with cost,0
light and sexy comfortable and provides moderate coverage without being a heavy lined cup,2
i love this boot the only thing i purchased a size 10 its a little snug i wish they would have had half sizes and i didnt want to take a chance and get an 11 because that would have been too big i tried them on with footies and they are doable i love them the color i was afraid wouldnt be rich enough but they are i cant wait to wear these i love the little pocket but when i officially wear them and see how they do after a couple of hours of wear and tare then i can really let you know if they were too snug or not love these shoes,2
i bought 2 one for my husband and i for hunting neither one worked,0
loved the color and the style but it ran small,1
i love the color the ease of getting it on and off the fact that i can make it as tight or loose as i want it but the edges snag my clothes,1
i had ordered these and they were really tight the waist wasnt an issue but the leg parts of them felt really tight luckily there is a return policy and i didnt get stuck with them,0
the upper button was lost within the first use,0
mehthe face on mine is kinda stretched and blurry not a cute detailed face like the picturealso the back is a straight lin kinda broochno big deal but i thought itd be the push kinddisappointed in how the face looks,1
gift for a friend she loved it,1
it was a little hard to put on but when it was on it fit great and was a tad bit longer than i had expected it hit about midriff and im 53 which is exactly what i was hoping for,2
i liked the farment ut flowed very well,2
poor quality i got the gold one and after 2 weeks the color changes and it turned my wrist green,0
its hard to find a good watch that wont weigh your wrist down but this one is it love it,2
poor condition,0
they are not a no show sock unless you are wearing traditional sneakers new balance they definitely run big as i ordered my regular size and they are too large i will keep them in hopes they will shrink in the dryer,1
just another cheap product from china dont buy didnt come with instructions,0
gems fell of nearly all of the jewelry and shoes she really loved it if it hadnt fell apart,0
it doesnt work as well as my last one bought a long time ago from a different manufacturer,1
pendant was fine but the chain broke on the 2nd day,1
it fit too small at the chest such a cute dress though,0
love this product bought them for my dad and hes worn them everywhere all summer long great transaction too,2
different fabric than the other dresses too small,1
its great but the chain is big and large my kid is 11 years old but it doesnt fit her so i had to put a better chain,1
these are amazing true to size plenty of stretch i love them so much i will be buying more they also have a 7800 price tag on them,2
falling apart after first hike,1
the hooks are too far to the side so it makes it nearly impossible to do by yourself without the waist strap xit went on nice and snug very softcomfortable but like i said its too difficult to do the waist strap by yourself,0
this did not flatter me my long torso made for a difficult fit,0
ive had socks exactly like this before some are even getting close to 12 years old and theyre still in good shape these however are not even close to the quality i used to expect from hanes they feel strange cheap and the threads are coming loose after only a few washings i doubt ill get much more than a year out of them i wont buy them again,0
great product and great customer service thanks,2
very comfortable very useful to use during the summer,2
terrible socks they are absolutely huge on my son he hates how they feel scratchy on his legs,0
this swimsuit is adorable but the sizing is all off the bottoms run big and the top runs small the quality is nice it is such a shame that it has all gone to waste due to sizing issues i normally wear a 7 with a 36c and got a large i reviewed this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,1
so far very pleased also tried a similar chip boot with lugged soles that were just not office appropriate but otherwise great boots these are fine for bizcaz office and also surprisingly light the size 105w i bought fit appropriately i wanted iron rangers but they are not available in blackwide size so i looked at a lot of alternatives and these fit the bill also less than 12 the price of the irs,2
these are gorgeous i cant believe how great they are for such a cheap price thanks,2
love this shirt wore it for a 5k the day after it arrived very comfortable and cute,2
they are soo cure but they are not true to size order 2 sizes up so sad i loved these,1
super pretty for a special friend she loved it i was very happy with the quality of this necklace,2
excelent,2
im a super curvy girl so i was kind of worried about this item making me look bigger than i am but i needed some comfy clothes for this summer so i decided to try it out this jumper hugs me im all the right places and is loose where you want it to be ill be buying more colors soon,2
didnt like outfit for myself,0
shoes are too wide and my feet flop in them,0
i have experience with naot it had exceptional arch support with a built in plastic arch support as i understand it they are expensive shoesbr they simply sent me a naot in my size but wrong shoe right size but had a very thick sole vs what i ordered amazon treated me right with a quick painless return may try again but these shoes are really pricey,0
super tight its almost to uncomfortable to wear,1
good sock but way too tight at the cuff then when you wash them even tighter ended up donating them,1
my son decided i was to be a tiger this year i wear a small in just about everything 5134 115lbs so i ordered a small theres plenty of room around the middle but the legs are rather short its also weird how the belly goes down to your knees for the price and convenience its fine though,1
wasnt sure if shed like it but it was a hit,2
se ven cálidos pero son muy grandes para mi bebe son como para niños de más de un año,0
time is way off still works,0
exceeded my expectations fast delivery just what i wanted lightweight frameless polaroized my mauies can take a backseat now,2
i got the turquoise scarf for my niece i was disappointed as its more of a dark teal than a turquoise the skulls are much larger than i expected i think it would look much better if they were half the size i probably wouldnt have purchased it if id seen it in a store,1
i opened the package and put it on one side of the jewel came off i used gorilla glue i hope it holds,0
quality is great and no weird stitching which i usually find on baby shoes the color is adorable,2
the material seemed amazing but the sizing is way off either it was a return and packaged wrong or they have issues with their size chart the pictures i attached were a comparison or a true fit size xl to their xl,0
issues with sore feet and athletes feet socks absorb sweat,2
pretty cheap material and hasnt softened in the few months and several washes like cotton should,1
although it was ordered my size the blouse was way too small had to send back,1
ran a little small thought pull on meant no zippers buttons were hard to use holes were a little small they were very long for capris,1
i have had this watch band for about 2 months and it had been nothing but terrible only thing it has going for it is it is slim comfortable and cute however the band kept separating from the face piece the piece that holds the fit bit i would just pop the pin back into place at first then i lost the pin so i just super glued it in it also hasnt held up at all at two months the cute pattern is already wearing off today the clasp fell off i popped the pin back in but i dont anticipate it to last i should have returned it and stubbornly kept it because of the cute pattern i wear this watch every day but have not done anything unusual or strenuous to it just a cheap design,0
the quality is not that good,1
great shirt a little small,2
i really wanted to like these shoes but they didnt fit well and were not attractive,1
just like i expected classy,2
this is cute bracelet but i was disappointed in the metalit looks cheap,1
purchased as a gift for my 6yr old god daughter she wanted dangle earrings and loves unicorns these are just the right size not so big they get caught on stuff while she plays but she likes that she can feel them move,2
this is exactly what i needed its completely adjustable so it fit perfect to my body the material was breathable so i wasnt overheating and it was a hot day i really like this and will likely repurchase in another color,2
i ordered 3 of these mirol sleeveless blouses the purple one was way off the arm holes were super small while the other 2 tops fit fine i cant return it because i tried on 1 and figured they all would fit now i am out being able to return this because i already removed the tags poor quality control at the arm hole size i had ordered size l and the other 2 size large fit perfectly,0
the color is not the same as the picture they are very green i also did not like the from pockets that kept sticking inside out,0
after 3 months i was putting these on and noticed a hole in them mind you i am 58 and weigh 120 lbs so these were somewhat big on me i have had leggings that have lasted over 10 years in fact this is the first pair of leggings that have ever gotten a hole in them,0
lil big,1
if i were to call it anything it might be an anklelength bandcollar shortsleeve buttondown shirt i was looking for a caftan liked the black background and dream catcher print and ordered looking no farther having purchased many caftans from amazon before all of the shirts in this style should be grouped together not sold as caftansbr and by the way there is another black shirt with a star print from the same company ranrui to beware of i bought it also this review applies to both the star and feather prints,0
for starters this is a pretty bra the fabric is shiny and the cups are comfortable i liked how they were larger and gave complete containment and coveragebr however im returning it because of the short band i ordered my normal size 38d and the band fits uncomfortably tight on the last hook i refuse to wear an extension and shouldnt have to with a new bra also the straps are way too thick and too short even after adjusting i found them very uncomfortablebr the sizing seems off by at least two sizes its unfortunate because its an attractive bra with ample cups,0
the plastic bar is a little too long so it doesnt sit nicely on my chest it also feels cheap but it looks like the picture,1
awesome,2
light weight,2
it was super tight and uncomfortable im a size medium in shirt and in bra 40 b,1
chain is literally shorter than the image shown on the product page,0
it does twist around and doesnt stay in place but i like it,1
they look fine but are made with cheap material wore it one day and my ear is red and swollen,0
i usually wear 812 but ordered size 9 they fit fine very stylish and comfortable i bought 2 pairs in black and burgundy,2
looked better in the picture,0
the product does not look like the picture it is a tiny yoga bag and only has room for 1 yoga mat and that is it i dont consider it a bag but a yoga mat cover,0
my son needed an analogue watch for work and he said this ones style was spot on very stylish,2
dress was adorable but sizing was way off too small there is no stretch at all had to return it,1
great for mild weather my son wears it most days to school,2
i loved this product for the day i got to use it at the end of the day the metal piece that holds the go2 to the necklace came out of the necklace with my upright device i will try to glue it back together,0
this is a beautiful belt and the metal work is wonderful however my daughter wore it for one day and it was falling apart all the blue was cracked and coming off and she cant wear it anymore because its just destroyed dont waste your money,0
gorgeous,2
beatifull dress classic,2
this shirt is so cute and well fitted not over sized and baggy like i was afraid of i ordered a small and like my shirts well fitted its perfect flattering its soft and well made happy with my order,2
runs a bit small nothing too dramatic though wore it to work yesterday and had several compliments on it,2
buy 2 sizes up but on mine the flower pattern didnt line up well and it just didnt work for me thankfully returns with ever pretty are super easy and seamless,1
mala calidad,1
when i received the watch strap i thought it looked and felt nice however i soon realized that it had a pin for installing onto my watch this is not compatible with my phase i emailed them to ask about it and no one got back to me im super upset as i needed it to work and there are hardly any strap options,0
these boots are adorable my granddaughter loved them but she wore them a lot for about 2 months and they look a year old they start cracking and the medal toe bends would rather pay more for some that last,1
i wanted it because it came down a little farther but the extra on the bottom of it just rolls up but other than that its super comfortable,1
cheap,0
need to know if background material is supposed to be white mine is light pink asked question but still waiting for answer,0
this shirt breathes well and felt great in the warm spring weather unfortunately thats about all i can say for it the fabric feels smooth too smooth like my hand is going to slide off when i touch it a sticker left a stain on the front near the buttons and it didnt come out in the wash it doesnt show when its tucked in but we know its there i might buy this again in a different color because its so lightweight and comfortable in warm weather but i cant really recommend this in white,1
these socks are terrible i got them on clearance for 5 at burlington coat factory they are too much polyester and make your feet boil by the end of the day also when you take them off even after several washings your feet are covered with black fuzz from the socks throwing mine away,0
very cute but fit way to big,0
this coat is really cute and warm however it is not well made the zipper broke after maybe 2 months very disappointing,0
way too small,0
bought two both stopped openingclosing properly with very occasional use,0
good quality but they run small and are shorter than appears on the picture,1
plastic,0
these pants are decent enough i like the color and the texture of the pants but disliked the elastic waist it was sewn on then folded over so it is odd and uncomfortable it was also hard to tell which way the pants were supposed to go on lol i will be returning these because they fit me oddly for reference i am 565 and weigh 210 lbs i got the 16 petit in hopes they would fit more at the ankle but was underwhelmed and will be returning these pants,1
in all fairness my husband doesnt generally like skinny fit jeans we thought with the word stretch in the description they would fit better no he wears between a 3234 waist and is very slender in the legs these almost looked like tights on him way to snug the waist was fine the color and workmanship was good the price is reasonable they are just uncomfortable for him and they look it maybe for a much younger man they would be perfect,1
shirt is ok but it does not have any of the purple variations like the picture so the textures are not as clean,1
ordered a size up than my actual size to be safe and this was still skin tight,1
a little long but works just the same,1
took the advice of other reviews and will take the side stays out they are uncomfortable and not needed the way the bra is designed the stays are too long and really poke into the ribs when you sit down too bad maidenform doesnt read some true review and modify their garments,1
i bought this for a gift to my kenyan niece she said she loves it yay,2
the item description said the shoe would fit my 612 month old my daughter is 8 months old lets just say they have their sizing day off their customer service is prompt and has been good to work with however but being in china it is going to take time for my replacements to come and these were something i wanted to use right away,0
the sizing problem aside these are good quality gym pants a little too much friction for a gymnastics floor but the are comfortable im more of a european small than an american small so these pants could almost fit me and my boss simultaneouslybr br the quality is good and they hold up to washing really well i should knowi coach 6 days a week and my own workout time,1
i really wanted this product but its too tightfitting and when i raise my arms it bunches up over my shoulders which looks pretty odd the fit was no forgiving despite their statement that it was stretchable i didnt experience any stretch at all,1
the fit is great but the darker ones have been washed a few times and are fading kinda bad the blue red mainly,1
fits perfect,2
unfortunately this arrived last night and had a hole in it like others the top part is way too loose and the bottom too tight if the price were higher i would have given fewer stars its good for price but weirdly cut the material is a vibrant color and its thin for hotter climates,1
purchased 4 of these tops and returned all of them ordered according to size chart xl my normal size and all were way too small would have had to order 2 sizes larger also the fabric was strange they were like a silky shiny jersey material not my style at all,0
i ordered my size its best for petite ladies not average or slim ladies,0
i really like these wish they were a little bigger,2
material is like some thin cheap jersey material,0
so useful,2
oh my goodness this blouse is beautiful i purchased the first one and had to send it back because it was a little too tight so i reordered and its perfect i recieced so many compliments so i am going to order more prints,2
i love it the fabric is nice and the fit is also nice i really like it,2
my daughter was super excited to order this dress we had been looking around forever for something similar and had no luck we checked the size chart and took her measurements before ordering i even asked to double check that the size would be what they suggested it is way to big shes a small young lady shes about 5152 and weighs 97lbs this dress is huge on her very pretty dress but the sizing is way off,0
this is a cute shirt but is very short in the torso as far as size i am usually a small or medium and the medium fit but is not designed for someone with a longer torso would be super cute on someone else,1
ripped the first night he wore it for halloween,0
my daughter loves this dress it fits her very well she was very pleased with the color and the style of the dress she will be wearing the dress to a sweet sixteen party,2
this was a tad too small so i had to return it looking for something with a small amount of give,1
my husband is very happy with this watch he thought he ordered an atomic watch that talked to replace his old one he received this atomic watch and realized it didnt talk but liked it so much he decided to keep it,2
so ordered knowing this sweater was oversized but the fit could be better the lower sleeve holes are so large it is hard to keep the sleeves pushed back and the sleeves are not really long sleeves i had to remove when cooking to avoid my sleeves not getting into the food i wish there was an extra small size because that probably would have been better i love how comfortable this sweater is and perfect for lounging i really wish there was half stars you could give because i would give it a half star more i did not return this item because i wanted it for loungewear but i would have if not intended for that,1
its just ok a little flimsy in my opinion,1
this same charm is sold on many sites and was worth what i paid for it on amazon it was just average and had nothing spectacular to recommend it over any other bell charm it suited the price and is an adequate addition for a charm bracelet,1
just too short for anyone with bad back a little disappointed but not worth returning quality is excellent,1
this was used as a gift,2
the setting and rose color is nice but 34engagement ring34 it is not dont expect to wear this as anything but costume jewelry,1
great product holds a lot of cards and easy to retrieve a card when needed,2
it was a waste of money the material and the zipper is not good quality material,0
my daughter got the small for herself and the extra small for her smaller friend for halloween they were maverick and goose it was large on both of them the small may have fit my daughter but it was too late to exchangebr br other than that it was a hit they looked really cool and loved them,2
well made and warm,2
i got these to keep my daughters girl scout pins on her uniform they didnt work no matter how many times i tried the back still came off,0
its good but s is too large for me,1
these shoes are terribly cute but not the most comfortable the soles are very hard not at all cushiony wouldnt purchase again,1
love the style not ruby red more like orange red i was trying to match a dressbr for the price not bad,1
this shirt is really adorable i ordered a large originally but did return for medium im 57 around 170lbs the medium is form fitting at the top i wear 36dd but then it flairs out almost too much it can definitely hide imperfections in the tummy area although even in the hips i could pull tons of extra fabric out to the side which is shocking bc i wear a size 13 or 15 in juniors i think because it is so large it clings where it can which isnt necessarily a bad thing id say it does run large bc normally i wear a l or xl in shirts i absolutely love this shirtdress i feel adorable when i wear it the sleeves are very short thats the only major downfall i have chubby arms and i wish they were a bit longer overall its quite long lots of room and its so dang comfortable i have now ordered 2 other colors,2
this arrived on time and was packaged nicely i washed it and let it hang dry it was soft and stretchy and i felt very comfortable and relaxed in this i prefer a v neck but this was not horrible i loved the bright colors and it was not see through it was very flattering on and i received compliments,2
perfect little shoe horns,2
purchased this costume for halloween but was disappointed for a few reasons 1 no chopsticks were included as depicted on the item 2 the flap above the head did not stay up and needed to be secured 3 there was an awful manufactured odor that did not dissipate even after 45 days of laying outbr br the fit is one size fits all and it fit me pretty well being a 6ft 200lb man though a bit large it also did fit my wife who is 5ft tall this is a versatile costume with a few flaws that if addressed could make it a solid outfit for any dress up occasion,1
cute attractive and supportive all i can ask for in a casual run around sandal,2
arrived broken,0
they roll down when i squat the tummy control ends before the fupa area creates more illusion of it however the glutes look great,1
watch is ok as far as style goes but not for keeping the time,1
broke the first day,0
a little tight and took a bit for the leather to stretch to fit my hands but did great for my cosplay,1
not what i expecti got this for a school bag for my daughter she is nine years old she liked it i feel there are junk zippers its poorly made and zero durabilitynot as pretty as picture,1
bought my sons sizethey were tight,0
looks great fits ok on my 2004 rubicon bullet point came off second day driving but goes right back on i could glue it but its not a big deal if you want something sturdy i wouldnt recommend it,0
my physical therapist suggested i wear this specific shirt unfortunately as many reviewers have already written doesnt feel true to size i guess i am just in between the m l but more than that it does not really keep my shoulders back which defeats the whole purpose finally be prepared to feel very warm while wearing this it is made entirely of poly and does not breathe killer during these warm summer months,1
they do not change to dark sunglasses like the photo my reason for purchasing the change is very faint but i do love the way they look,1
these are lovely stretchy bell bottom pants with a vibrant printtrue to the photobr br they are plenty long and the waist is very high with the slight elastic band hitting just above the belly buttonbr br these pants are more for wearing out and no so much for yoga or gymtheyre just not designed for that due to the wide bell leg but i get tons of compliments when i wear these out these are a pleaser for sure,2
material is comfy and stretchy but my sweater has quite a few loose strings hanging off i think for someone taller or thinner this might look cute but im 56 and 145lbs and it just made me feel a little clunky but it is super warm and super comfortable and if i lose some weight i may get another one,1
this is a great tshirt for working out i like the soft fabric i have washed is several times and it has not shrunk at all the fit is as expected and runs true to the size,2
i always come back to buxton for wallets this one has a place for everything and i do mean everything i really like the currency compartmentthere are two slots for bills and a center zippered compartment for coins receipts or large denominations theres also a change pouch in front for easy access there are almost enough card slots and there are a number of plastic sleeves if you run out of slots for some reason the slots are not of uniform size and i had to do some finagling to make some of my cards fit i also wish the snap flap went over the currency compartment so i didnt have to keep it zipped but ill get used to it and im sure the leather slots will loosen up with usebr br after an exhaustive online and in store search ive decided that this clutch gives the best bang for the buck mine is red and its a rich not fire engine color im very pleased,2
way to loose slide right off my face never had this happen before cheap looking as well,0
the top of shoe is lightweight but bottom is hard material this makes shoe hard to put on,1
the toe box is to narrow for my foot with a compression sock and orthopedic device to even get the shoe on i have 3 new balance shoes that accept same with no problem,0
i was on the fence about purchasing this because it was a little more expensive than the others i was looking at as soon as i opened up the package i was happy that i did this box is beautiful i wish i could set it out somewhere in the house as a display piece lol if you are looking for one for yourself or even better to get that man in your life a gift you wont go wrong with this,2
this is a nice enough skirt just like what youd expect is what you receive very flowing however i cannot wear it unless i hem it not experienced,1
pro i love the color of these sandals and they are perfect to go with my outfit i had heard positive things about clark shoes and decided to give them a try pro they were lots cheaper than other sandals i am not sure i will ever buy clarks again but i will wear these on occasions that i am only going to be in them for a very short period of timebr br con unfortunately they are not good for wearing an entire day after a few hours on my feet i could definitely tell that they were not vionics or merrills quality the night after wearing them my feet were burning as they only do if i chose to wear very inexpensive flip flops even the next day my feet hurt so i put on some good supportive athletic shoesbr br it does seem ridiculous to pay the amount that is charged for vionics and merrills the comfort to my feet and the fact that i can wear them multiple seasons make the price more acceptable,1
runs very very small,0
love my new yoga slingsbr they fit true to size and feel absolutely amazing on your feet they came in a reusable drawstring bagbr i have other more expensive pairs of yoga slings and these are just as nice theyre actually even more comfortable than one pairbr if you really get down and compare them with the more expensive ones you can see several differences but theyre still great especially for the price if your on a budget and want yoga slings then these are what youre looking forbr i will be ordering these in a few additional colors for the price you can not beat the qualitybr i received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review and it in no way affects my opinion nor am i obligated to leave a positive review i have personally tested this product and all opinions posted here are mine and mine alone,2
boots look nice but arent great quality probably wont last me more then this winter not made to be walking for long periods of time quite hard,1
they dont fit,0
fits is great and so is the size,2
its perfect it looked fantastic ive gotten many compliments its just like the perfect evening dress or cocktail dress for a slightly plus size woman who doesnt want to show her arms but whose legs still look pretty good,2
i have gotten lots of compliments and the material is great soft and comfortable its perfect to wear over a medical mask for double protection the only reason i didnt give full ratings is because the color is misleading the shirt i received is full on halloween orange im ok with it and it looks cute paired with the right outfits,1
material starting falling apart and fuzzing up first hour i wore them theyre trash,0
seriously amazon you need to start having some standards for stuff you promote this is a garbage,0
the balls need to be really secure i lost a few when i thought they were on their good but they are the perfect size for my second loves and outer cartilage,2
these shoes are very cushy they feel like slippers i havent worn them 34all day34 so i cant say if they would be comfortable for that long of a time i also cant remember if they were offered in a smooth leather versus the suede if they were i regret not choosing that option,2
great boots bought for my sons halloween costume and now he wears them all the time,2
outstanding quality and fit im 56 145lbs 36d this is my go to shirt in the heat dress it up or work out double front lining is a bonus,2
so cute so comfortable nice big toe box good support without being too squishy i hate shoes that try to force your ankles into a particular position these dont comfy enough to walk all day in so cute they make random clothes look like a high end 34outfit34,2
i ended up returning it it looks cheap in person but it was not expensive so that makes sense just not for me,1
this is more polyester looking and therefore i was disappointed i thought it would be more of a cotton look or flowy but nopelooked like my mom would wear itkinda like a chicos knockoff i got the animal print and returned ittried two sizes and both looked bad,1
this is a lovely lightweight trenchcoatstyle raincoat but it runs really small and is narrow in the hips i would go up at least 1 if not 2 sizes this is definitely a spring coat even with layers it isnt going to keep one very warm,1
first one of the shirts was not in the package i did contact amazon but no response from the seller the sizes are way off much smaller than expected,0
cute girl bunny stake but smaller than expected,1
these fit really small definitely not true to size,0
i was walking one day and the strap gave out where the top pin is as if its made out of cardboard or something super cheap dont expect quality with this,0
returned item was not pleased with fabric it was screen printed onto knit did not like it also ran small,0
exactly what i was looking for at a good price nice traditional assortment of patterns have held up well through a lot of use good value,2
ive been wearing champion sport bras for years and they still are the best fitting and most comfortable for tennis and exercise i will stick with champion because every time i try to order another brand they are either too big or too little its too hard to try to order som other brand online,2
shoes fit but toes hung over the top had to return,0
fabric very poor quality it pilled after being worn twicebr very disappointing,0
not my favorite in my opinion my normal size ended up being an oversized cardigan i dont like the placement of the sleeve line and the sleeves ride up quite a bit but it is pretty comfortable and has some weight to it which i like,1
its cute just a little bit shorter than i was expecting its not cropped but it sure is close i didnt find it particularly cooling but it wasnt warm either the little flair at the bottom is adorable,2
wish i wouldve returned these i dont like the lining or drawstrings,0
lenses work but clumsy clip on detracts,0
they started out as a decent pair of sun glasses they come with an awesome carrying case also after a few months of use one of the lenses started to pop out though had it not of fallen apart as fast as it did it would of easily been a 4 or 5 star,0
they dont stay hooked very disappointed in them,0
i wear a large the large fits just its not a compression fit its just closer than i like in a tee im not sure whats going to happen after going through the washer and dryer but i suspect it may become unwearablebr br all of which is too bad the fabric is soft and heathered a brushedlike finish the neck detailing is much nicer and more comfortable than a crew neck the length is just right its very comfortable and in fact im wearing it as i type thisbr br it is a nice tee but i strongly suggest ordering up a size,1
too big i ordered a m size and i got xxl sizebr i dont recommend this product,0
very long like past my knee two inches i know im short but this is very long,1
these did not stay tied and stretched out after only a few weeks of wear will not buy again,1
comfortable but my foot is right at the edge these are not for all day wear,1
this scarf is huge soft and the colors are bold beautiful,2
fabric is nice but v is cut too low for anyone over 21 and runs small,1
i like wearing them they dont scrunch up are flattering and are the right length for longer legs,2
the pendant is nice but i wanted something smaller the big negative to this piece of jewelry is that the chain is way too thin to support the pendant my chain was in knots which i didnt want to try to get out i was afraid i would break the chain if i were to try to get those knots out,0
i just received my order today and this are tiny i mean tiny like for kids bracelet not happy nothing like the pictures at all,0
love it,2
its aight,0
the blue watch is very pretty but cheaply made the band popped off the first time i tried to put it on,0
zipper broke on the first day im not the only person to have this happen read the other reviews in addition these are mild weather gloves not really cold weather gloves as advertised almost got frostbite when wearing these in under 30 degree weather,0
top fit perfectly but bottoms are too snug,1
the idea of these pants are nice but the waistband is entirely too big theres no elasticity in the waistband and they constantly fall down and dont even think about putting your phone in the pocket all it does is drag the already horribly huge waistline down super disappointed save your money,0
this is a great wallet ive been looking for something that looks good and slides into my front pocket easily while being able to carry all my cards and cash this foots the bill,2
i absolutly love wearing this necklace with my royal blue tunic top and vest it looks amazing,2
if i had to use the rating scale 1 out of 10 1 being the lowest 10 being the highest these are hands down a 1 terrible poor construction horrible fit built it bra is not positioned even close to your natural boobs just another throw away piece of garbage shirt unless you want it live in phoenix az,0
lost color in two days some of them are not tight enough,0
these shoes are so comfortable and versatile they look like dress shoes but clean easily are water proof and comfortable very pleased,2
love these for my daughter and myself,2
nice looking earrings especially for the price but a little too big,1
these are so small more like the size for a small child,0
bought this for 1599 a bot over a year ago what an increasebr dont you wish you had the ability to make your paycheck increase like thisbr will never do biz here againbr quality is just ok nothing special,0
these are the best fitting most comfortable masks weve worn over the last 6 months after losing one were now ordering more easy to wash also,2
this gift was very well received they loved the hat,2
i really wanted to love these shoes i was dying for shoes i could be on my feet on comfortably all daybut alas it was not meant to be these shoes have 0 arch support and though they are not snug on the foot at all a massive plus they felt like they were already broken in easily accommodating my wider feetthe insole is definitely narrow at the ball of the foot which left my feet to develop blisters where my foot rubbed the line where the memory foam met the 34normal34 inner part of the shoe i did however love the feel of how the 34bubbles34 on the bottom feltbut with no arch support at all and the morenarrowthannormal insole in the front half of the shoewell lets just say im glad i got these on amazon and saved a few bucksbr br yes i do realize these are not wide width shoes normally this is not an issue in any way shape or form as i only prefer the slightly wider width to prevent toe squeezing since having high arches also means the top of the shoe presses on your foot when tied in a different way however when compared with all my other sneakers all skechers none wide widththe front end of the memory foam insole is narrower than all of them considering how the memory foam is the major selling point of the shoe and the fit of the shoe is already very relaxed and soft making a wider cushion you could actually sink your foot into would be an excellent adjustment even for narrowfooted folks,0
good quality and wrinkle resistant,2
i would have loved this dress if it hadnt been shedding sequins all over the place return was fast and easy with ups drop off,0
sorry but there is no way these sweaters rival better quality ones you get what you pay for at least in this case but theyre fine for the price and if you like very lightweight sweaters these are a good choice i got one in black that ill enjoy for as long as it lasts the one in ivory as thin as these are is seethru i would not wear it without an undershirt so size up if you get a light colored one cheers,1
bought for my mother in law as a grandma gift she loves it runs small i returned and bought her 2 sizes up,2
such a simple idea but what a perfect product i was looking for something to hold my earrings where i wouldnt have to open them to store them then open again when im in a hurry to put them onso trays or something i saw this and thought thats it the pictures dont show it but the holder mounts so it is a little bit away from the wall to allow for the earring backs and hooks all of the hardware came with it including a couple of little mounts in case you want to stand the holder up instead of mounting it to the wall the only reason i was reluctant to give this five stars is because once i started loading it up i realized that a few posts along the bottom might have been nice i like to link my closed loops together and i could have hung them on posts easily but i can open one and drop it through any hole just as well love this product,2
looks a little like the picture but came very wrinkly and looked baggy on me,0
great fit at a great price,2
the size runs smaller then expected trying to return but they only want to give me a 20 refund and not return the product the dress is pretty and soft still would like the product but in a larger size,1
this fits well but its way to large at the neck,1
support hose are great for varicose veins they provide comfort and support they help keep your legs from getting tired but its summer and i want to wear sandals calf compression sleeve provide the same somfort and support as my support hose while leaving my feet bare i still cant wear shorts but at least my pants completely cover the sleevesbr this brand is especially good bright colors help me feel more summery,2
definitely not for vigger breasted people at all,0
love this watch great for the money wrist band is thin very attractive,2
a little expensive but since it is a novelty it is worth it,2
its ok,0
trash,0
certainly a 5 star watch for the quality you receive for such a minimal price this watch is the ultimate in comfort and convenience easy to set clear to read and perfect for nearly any occasion very pleased with my purchase,2
perfect fit,2
before ordering this bag i read all reviews and took a chance in the first 24 hours this bag broke the zipper just let out and i barely had anything in it the worst part is i was traveling in south america and then had no other bag to use for my toiletries i definitely dont recommend,1
although these are really cute they are almost impossible to latch i have to try several times and push very hard to get it to pop through the hole im pretty disappointed in the struggle required to put this on,1
ive ordered other windbreakers from vendors but i am not happy with this one i do not like the quality or thinness of this brand reviews said that the jacket runs true to size i find that it runs small i wear a size large so i bought a size large jacket could barley zip it up,1
if youre looking for a photo shoot dress for your little onethis is perfect the material is very fragile and did not hold up well even hand washing and air drying and the belt is hugeit fit me,1
cute but too small or smaller than i imaginedbr the five stones together are only like 15 cm long so that when i put it on instead of having a bling effect it just looked like i had a bumpy crescent moon in my cartilage not very flattering,0
too large and too long is that really xsmall,1
sadly on this day of writing a review am returning the wallet the zipper split in half it is nice leather perfect for bare basics i loved it until the zipper broke,1
i bought the timex ironman t5k416 which may be a perfectly fine watch except that it doesnt meet the stated alarms settable for daily weekday weekend and weekly the weekly feature was critical for me ie being able to set the alarm to ring each week at a specific daytime eg thurs 1130 am the t5k416 doesnt have this capability so i returned it with no problems thanks amazon this was no fault of amazon since the timex website also misadvertises this watch in the description it says daily weekday weekend and weekly but the downloaded pdf says daily weekday weekend no weekly many watches on the timex website are similarly incorrectly described the only timex i knew about with the weekly feature was another ironman model t54281 i had owned this once before but vowed not to buy it again because the sleek band breaks within a short period and is not replaceable this problem is noted in the many critical reviews on both the timex and amazon websites so how to find a timex with the weekly alarm and a reasonably durable band the timex website was useless as was a phone call to timex customer service who said daily is the feature i want but i informed this rep that daily means the alarm goes every day at the indicated time not just on one specific designated day i was getting discouraged until somehow after more web browsing i found the asinb003ucwwxi timex ironman sleek 50lap fullsize digital mens watch t5k335 which does have the weekly feature confirmed when i downloaded the pdf from the timex website and a band that looks reasonably durable so i ordered it from amazon wore it today for the first time and voila the alarm went off exactly as set thurs 1130 am just in time to buy lunch before my meetingbr bottom line probably the t5k416 is fine if you like these timex styles but the following sums up my experiencebr br the right timex i wanted to seekbr but my chances were seeming quite bleakbr true they all take a lickingbr and keep right on tickingbr but few alarms chime once a week,1
bought this shoe for my husband to wear for work long lasting and very comfortable he has purchased the same style just not steel toe for leisure wear,2
i ordered black and was hoping it came ready to wear but no it arrived grey and it has a huge hole in the seambr i gave it a second star because the fabric seems soft and weighty like it might be nice but i will never know returning,0
love it nice and big but not too big love the design with the link i dnt really generally care for the white colors inside the link buts its nice very pretty would recommend,2
nice sweater and color only thing is that its lighter than expected i have the same sweaters in different colors and they are heavier compared to this one,1
im 50 120lbs this was a big large on me it looked cute off the shoulder but if i moved my arms around the shoulders popped up and then it was around my neck this might be ok for pool time kind of moomoo ish,1
these get all fuzzy even before the first washing they are very slick on wooden floors dont keep my feet warm and dont breathe very well keeping my feet hot and sweaty sometimes but not warm they do not feel comfortable in my boots,0
these are nice basic shirts but they are no warmer than regular ones that are not marketed as thermal,1
crossbody bag is the perfect size to grab and go and the multiple zip pockets are ideal for phone keys etc will be buying a second one in a different color,2
purchased this bag as my personal item for traveling was was surprised how much room there was upon unfolding this bag good quality and as described very happy with this purchase,2
my specs 52 120 lbs 32dd size smallbr br i really really wanted to love this i love the pattern the color and the look on the model but this just wasnt for mebr br the fit was not great i would have needed to size up in order to get the coverage i needed for both the top and the bottom but the size was right if i sized up for coverage it would have been too big sizewisebr br if you are a little on the curvier side for your weightheight you may want to consider sizing up or just know that your hiney may not have comfortable coveragebr br did you find this review helpful please let me know,1
watch broke within 2 weeks of using band came apart after 2 days even when it did work it didnt keep time,0
these shorts are a well made well designed comfortable product that protect womens sensitive areas very well they make riding comfortable,2
love it the quality and the price,2
i wear a size 10 they dont fit,0
its a bit larger than i expected but it is a pretty piece easy to adjust strap,1
this bathing suit is beautiful as described i am 5634 and weigh 132 pounds i picked the size 810 as i pulled it on i could hear seams ripping i could also hear seams ripping as i pulled it off no evidence of gaping seams but this suit is cheaply made the bottom is as other reviewers have described very loose i dont intend to wear another suit over the bottom as others have done i will likely attempt to sew some tucks to make it a bit smaller and will likely only wear this once this suit may fit a large bottomed woman but i doubt the suit would hold up to be pulled over an ample rump dont be fooled by the beauty dont waste your money unless you plan to do some sewing repairs,0
small but great space to protect cards with los of slots and a zipper to fold bills and put in change,2
i was disappointed to find that there was only one sleeve i was able to cut the other side open and still wear it over my bathing suit at the beach this year i liked the color and it still served its purpose so i guess thats all that counts,1
they would be knee high to a very short person,1
after i washed it doesnt looks nice looks old,1
to big keep falling off my face,0
nice for the price,2
not very good material would be better suited as a coverup,1
i couldnt wear these boots but there are so cute plenty of faux fur inside boot to keep feet toasty well to keep my moms feet toasty i could barely get my foot inside the 7 she wears a 55 lol,1
fit well but rolled up my thighs while working out,1
cute ok for tall andor busty ladies i am 53410 38g purchased xxl could have gotten away with 1x casual wear,1
it wasnt the quality i had expected i dont expect to use this more than a couple times before it falls apart,0
not proportional at all these pants were huge on me the small was more like a large,0
it was pretty but small in the boob area it seemed like it was made well and the material was pretty but i had to send it back because it squished my boobs together,1
these pjs are fun and my kids love them but they arrived in poor packaging that didnt prevent the glow in the dark parts from sticking to each other when unfolding them after opening the box the fabric stuck to itself and ripped some of the glowing parts offso it was damaged before the first use,1
it was a gift for my wife and when she unwrapped it it 5 strings about 12 long were hanging off the edge and when she pulled on one of them the edge started to unravel she had to sit on christmas night and sew all the ends in so that it wouldnt fall apart before she wore it very disappointed,0
i wear a size 11 wide and i found the size xl to be very comfortable these are great for people who need a wide width they are very soft material exactly what i had hoped for also the price was right its a good value and good for daily use around the house,2
these earrings are too cute i love the look my only complaint is the fringe part slides around alot,1
love them,2
broken,0
daughter loves them match a lot of outfits shes 5 and in a size 12,2
good,2
you get what you pay for very loose and stretched out even looser after wearing also gets really dirty very quickly because of the material,1
super soft material and the colors looks great the scarf is large so can be worn many different ways,2
i sized down and i am glad i did it is still very long so i need to get it hemmed other than that it is super comfy,2
beautiful and unique for public school uniform,2
nice knit polyester blend ties color and pattern is interesting without being overwhelming they tie well and hold a knot and dont seem to wrinkle easily fancy nope but functional and affordable,2
it works as stated tin is nice it stores the sponge on the top in its own container,2
i wear a size 35 so i went ahead and bought a large the fit is pretty good however the elastic in the waistband is not very tight so they have a tendency to slip down a little bit the fabric feels nice and they look great,1
dont buy this item,0
cute suit but fits small i could have made due with the top but the bottoms were too tight i had to return this and buy a larger size for size reference im 52 124 lbs and a 36c i do love the colors and design of this suit,1
the cap material is described as 34waxed canvas34 in fact it is thin flammable plastic vinyl the material doesnt breath and you will need to stay away from an open flame of any kind it feels like wearing a cheap shower cap very deceptive descriptions are the backbone of this spineless operation,0
a few stones popped out in transit,1
nice thank you,2
great fit,2
i had to return this because it was defective it arrived with ripped seams and thread strings hanging off all over the place it was not safe for my baby i was very cute but so cheaply made that i had to return it and dont even trust ordering another,0
love these i got them because my daughter had them and i fell in love with them,2
i bought two sizes too small for maximal control unfortunately there was no control at all all measurements withwithout the garment were exactly the same save money and buy a nice slip that will do the same,0
expected more of a dress less of a swimsuit cover,1
the vneck is very high and almost fits like a crew neck but it is much easier to put on it worn over another shirt or by itself the cotton is soft and comfortable it is wellmade true black all season sweater to layer very attractive and a fine addition to any mans wardrobe,2
this is fine if you wear something underneath the shoulders and neckline just fall away,1
dont buy this please i triedto take it off and the rubber part came off but now the metal part is stuck in the watch an almost 200 dollar device now unusavle because i cant put a new band on it,0
i liked the way this fit my curves and the length is prefect for me highlow makes feel like i have train on my dress,2
said to order usual size not even close way to small waste of my time returned,0
all i wear is darn tough,2
i really like this rain poncho its really cute it didnt take a long time to arrive my only con because its plastic it had an overwhelming smell i had to wash it and soak it overnight with febreeze which lessened the smell but not completely get rid of it,1
i had originally ordered size 24 but they were too big i returned and ordered size 20 53260lbs and they fit perfectly i am rounder in the tummy and usually means sag in jeans somewhere these literally fit perfectly,2
too thin bra straps and outlines too visible,0
very very sheer so will use as bathing suit cover up instead of dress too hot in tx to layer it enough to not look like youre not wearing anything,1
while they are warm and comfortable the socks are not waterproofbr br ive worn them with running shoes that arent waterresistant nor waterproof twice now one was for a 45minute walk and one was for a 5k run during light rainfall in both instances the socks started to get damp about half hour into both sessionsbr br if waterproof is the only attribute you are looking for then you are likely to be disappointed,1
caused blisters in the toe,0
i wanted to like this shoe because its cute but it rubbed my foot the wrong way and was too tight on my foot so im going to need to return it it may work for your foot though,0
i ordered the black tank the color is more of a grey instead and im not pleased with that i did read other reviews and ordered a medium instead of a large and it fit well the quality isnt great but overall i still liked the shirt alright,1
the robe was very small and i ordered a large,1
i tried to cancel it but they would allow me to it only lasted about 12 weeks and then it broke it took long delivery and the product at 8 dollars yet the total was 20 because of shipping dont recommend but its cute just takes too long,0
very comfortable fits just right,2
i loved the material but had to return these leggings im 411 130135 the medium shouldve fit but i couldnt even get it passed my knees the sizing is way off it looked like it was made for kidsbr i will reorder in xl hopefully itll fit otherwise it seems to be well made i loved the pockets,1
extremely short even fully opened would barely fit over my head then the uke is at nose level,0
this is a really pretty dress and it fit as expected but when i tried it onthe sequins on the inside seams are like little scratchy nuisances im an excellent seamstress so i was surprised that a dress like this would have that problem for the price i wasnt going to deal with taking out all of the offending sequins so i returned it,0
love these pants they are the coolest scrubs could easily pass for lululemon workout clothes perfect fit and soft material i bought a small and i usually wear 68 very highly recommend i will buy again in a different color however the steel is a soft gray very nice i just started wearing scrubs and have tried a few these are by far my favorite,2
i am 511 and 220lbs i ordered a green xl and it was extremely short on me although it was too short the dress was very soft and felt comfortable i will still be wearing this dress but unfortunately ill have to add leggings the color is amazing it is a slightly thin material but not see through i hope this helps,1
love this shirt very flattering and very fun,2
this bag has the same design as all of the other ita bags on amazon ones that ive purchased before but this one doesnt actually have a front pocket to put pins and keychains in its just a purse with a heart design on the front what a disappointment its definitely getting returned and ill just buy from a different seller,0
it barely went over my chest and i am not big chested not flattering at all also does not have pockets as shown i bought one other dress from this brand and love it but this one absolutely not,0
what a great chew toy especially for aggressive chewers i have 2 70lb pit mixes who are the ultimate toy destroyers and this amazing chewy toy has now lasted several weeks without any signs of wear the durability is amazing and so far chew proof this would be a great teether for larger breed puppys as a teething toy as it is really strong but has the flexibility a puppy teether needs great dog toy highquality product,2
it is ok product reasonable quality for the price apart from the flaw already mentioned by others it is fine,1
this sweatshirt is awesome well made super cute and comfy very soft material great price,2
i can say that we love these pajamas for our granddaughter but they are beyond tight on her arms we have to prestretch the arms so they dont squeeze too hardbr our sweet little girl isnt overweight so we are not sure that this brand will be something we purchase againbr they are soft,1
i am 53 112 pounds and i ordered a size xs the dress itself is boxy so it looked odd on my petite figure the bottom of the dress does not run straight down instead it flares out which was a big no for mesince the product picture shows it as straight down the sleeves are also wide the fabric is scratchy i sadly had to return it,1
very cute but very small shirt was really short more like a bra and the shorts were very thin material that showed my butt cheeks if anything i would give it 3 stars i only made use of the shirt with high waisted jeans definitely would buy this a size up,1
hot pink was not hot but regular pink definitely did not match the color in the picture,0
had them in my pocket for about 30 mins and they snapped i can probably fix it but i shouldnt have to after one use,1
these shoes are only ok for winterbr if its wet out you will get cold and soggy feetbr only comfortable with a really good pair of thick socksbr i would not purchase again,0
update stars are removed for quality so i paid 120 for four months of using these shoes now they have hole in the front mesh and in material inside of the shoe after four months they going to trash i sent email to asics they did not bother even to respondi liked them i even bought the same pair for my son and now we both have holes in this asics mens gel kayano 22 running shoebr br the reason i bought this pair was an upgrade from my old asics 21 that had the same problem holes in the meshbr br i am done with asicsbr __________________________________________________________________________________________________br br original reviewbr br this review is for pair of asics shoes they are listed here as 34asics mens gelkayano 22 running shoe34br br first i was stupid enough to follow amazon size suggestion i always wear size 13 d regular so amazon 34fit find the right size34 drop down offered me correct size what a joke i got as advised size 125 d regular the shoe was too short and not wide enough my foot hurts all over even removing asics sole and replacing it with thin one did not help much i was able to put them on but not able to wear them all daybr br on my second try i got my size size 13 and i got widest 4e now it works i would probably would be fine with 2e but i didnt want to risk it againbr br so shoe gets five star but amazon advise get zero stars,0
i got these titanium hoops for my nostril piercings because before that i had what the piercer pierced me with which was some type of stainless steel my body didnt react well with it causing keloids i had to continuously get rid of tip if you get keloids on pierced areas you can simply remove them by applying a mixture of saline water and crushed noncoated aspirin a dab of the paste on the affected area over night for a few days or until gone will shrink and disappear it no need to remove piercings after about 6 months i switched to surgical steel thinking that my body would react better but i still ended up getting keloids just not as frequently i ended up finding out that surgical steel still has a small amount of nickel in it which is what causes most negative reactions to bodyface piercings so i decided to go with this titanium titanium is not magnetic and has no traces of nickel the hoops were very easy to put in and the clasp is very sturdy when shutting you can hear the click noise ive had them in for about over a week and ive had no keloids or negative reactions and they passed the magnetic test so it really is titanium my piercings feel so much better and more comfortable and are able to finally heal properly 1010 product,2
this is not very functional at all when you put up the hood the whole garment hangs off your head and its very uncomfortable if you dont need to wear the hood its otherwise ok zipper is decent but not greatbr br not recommended,1
jeez dude settle down theyre only socks writing this cuz my phone bullied me into it,2
amazing the difference these computer readers make it honestly reduces the glare,2
this t was perfect in size color and price quality feels good but only time will tell after a few washings so far ite great would buy again,2
seems to run small i ordered a small it did fit but definitely true to size runs very small so order larger if in doubt she says very comfortable,1
my husband purchased these and they were to tight and didnt fit around his neck comfortably be sure to measure before purchasing,0
please amazon these sun glasses are not polarized they are tinted but they are not polarized to check look at car windows in the sun you should see little swirls that are invisible to naked eyes also you can try to look at a computer screen and you should have a tough time seeing it with polarized lenses,0
my first impression was pretty horrible because it was shipped in an envelope instead of a box and arrived really crushed and wrinkled thankfully i was able to pop it back into shape and it worked out well for my 4 year olds zorro costume he loved it and it was of an okay quality that it worked for his costume and i could reshape it after it was crushed but the seller definitely needs to work on their shipping and packaging choices,1
faded the same day i wore it,0
we bought the white ball cap cute hat my 18 month old loves it and it matches all her clothes keeps the sun off her face and head well,2
i bought this suit for vacation and it was too big so i bought another in a smaller size and it was great got many compliments by the pool in mexico,2
you only get 1br would have never bought it if the pictures and description were accurate and not so deceptive shame,0
nice,1
great product made after shoulder surgery much easier a bit pricy but totally worth it very comfortable run slightly larger than size expected but that is helpful when you cant dress yourself,2
love them,2
made for short and very thin people,0
with out washing sweater pilling in 15 day and after one wash it get shrink bad product,0
super small and thin,0
cute shirt but it runs insanely big the 06 month should not be advertised for anything smaller than 6 month old,0
very stiff and uncomfortable,0
lightweight breathable and stylish,2
i wanted tabi socks i could wear with regular shoes so i can come home kick them off and slide into flip flops these are too thick for the regular shoes other than that seem fine but for me useless,0
ok level,1
the fit is a little snug but not uncomfortable bought a medium the sleeves are what really bug me i feel like i could take flight or something with them lol its such a cute top and im going to give it a chance the sleeves will be a deal breaker if they end up driving me crazy,1
the legs arent snug so they flare out a bit which looks weird,1
i purchased this watch for my dad as a gift for fathers day while i was initially very pleased with itand he loved itthe glass front on the face fell off and shattered while he was wearing it just over a month after purchase it was just past the 30 days return window not sure what my options are nowbut very disappointing,0
looks antiquey it is a nice little gift necklace i kept one for myself 0,2
good fit good product i definitely recommend for those looking for a decent bathing suit on a budget these things can get expensive for reference ive been using the bathing suit for about two months and its been holding up nicely i make sure i rinse it after each swim to get the chlorine off a word on fit im 51 and 144 lbs mostly in the butt lol and i must say that even the large was a bit too large for me if youre on the cusp go with a medium for a more flattering fit,2
this is not at all a coat and i returned it the material was lighter weight than most of my blouses maybe they consider this a coat in china but not me it was however easy to return it,0
this company offers great shirts i have bought this one and instantly tried it on and am very happy i did its nice and roomy with very soft fabric if i go into the forest i will be comfortable wandering until i get lost and have to call for rescue if i go to the mountains and hike until i fall and have to be rescued i will be comfortable in this shirt everyone should have at least one in their closet,2
turns white shoes yzellow,0
i loved it because it motivated me the first time i put it on i was on a date and the np charm broke below the loop it cant be fixed im sad,1
like the way it fits and looks not liking that its only water resistant and not waterproof,1
i just received this cute watch fit perfect and i loved the looks problem is it doesnt keep time the second hand goes around but not the hour and minute hands they do not budge it is not eligible for refundi should have checked this out beforehandso ive requested a replacement waiting to see if that happens,0
i love the look of these shoes however they do run small and have little to no arch support i am generally a 7 or 65 and have a 7 while i can wear the boot my toes definitely touch the front of the shoe next time and there will be a next time i will get a 75 or maybe even an 8 so i can put in an insole because this thing really has no arch support at all,2
the product is soft and warm but size up im a size 5 and these are sized smaller than they are i bought for size 56 and there is no way someone with a size 5 12 much less a size 6 foot could fit these slippers,1
love the dress whimsical specially with the addition of the petticoat modest too nice neckline and knee length very flattering great selection we have bought several and they are very well made great for dancing such a flair,2
i was so in love with these shoes when i opened the box last night just had to plug my nose to get around the strong chemical smell i put dryer sheets in the box overnight hoping it would help alleviate the strong smell it worked to some extent but not all the waybr i was super excited to wear the wonderful shiny gold platform nature breeze size 6 shoes to work this morning they fit great and were for the most part comfortable although the sides of the shoes felt sharp on the bottomsides of my feet after the first hour that seemed to go awaybr at 1000 am pst ide been wearing the shoes for about 3 12 hours and the bottom insole of the left shoe started to bunch up and come out through the toe area not to comfortablebr as i tried to straighten it out the whole thing came out so i super glued it back in i mean what am i going to do im at work i cant run around barefoot or with one shoe hopefully the glue holds and it doesnt happen to the right shoebr i would give a higher rating otherwise theyre super cute but boy do they smell and now they have super glue smell added to itbr im pretty sure that i would order from nature breeze again hopefully the next ones wont smell,1
i didnt receive the same necklace as advertised the chain isnt twisted like in the photos and its hard to clasp feels cheap,0
since i dont iron i dont use,0
item as described cute,2
dress was well worth the money it will need to hemmed if you are under 5ft2in very pretty dress,2
this does nothing but squeeze you if you need weight loss assistance this does not provide it its not like a sweat assistant and too uncomfortable to wear without clothes wouldnt recommend,0
no frills but useful quiet,2
son loves the brewers never had a stocking hat very warm,2
holds quite a few cards seems to be well constructed probably wont go back to a billfold,2
this gi is really cute until you wash it once its completely destroyed after 1 wash i didnt put any other towels etc in with it and it came out covered in white lint that wont come off being a single mom i dont have alot of extra income for my sons karate wear very disappointed in this purchase,0
these are the most comfortable sandals ive ever owned im a hairdresser and im able to wear these on a concrete floor for 9 hours a day with no problems i want them in every color,2
cute belt fits perfectly,1
the product was stiff and rough on the skin and fit awkwardly the knot sat at a unflattering place,0
doesnt stick very well,0
the belt is really cute its a little more flimsy than expected i havent worn it yet but its very pretty,0
variedad de colores,1
this product was not true to size i ordered a size up and the top was still too small,1
the fabric is stiff seriously stiff and scratchy i didnt even try it on cuz i couldnt imagine the fabric on my skin the color and buttons are off too over all it looks like a home made school jumper ugh,0
i just wish the skirt i received was as dark as the picture shows the skirt i received is more of a light brown vs the dark brown i was hoping for,1
very excellent sunglasses i use them specifically for bike riding and the curving arms and tight fit enable the glasses to stay snug and provide constant shade from the sun these glasses shipped surprisingly fast and came w a handy little soft case too both thumbs up on this one,2
nice shoe for suits,2
the fit is perfect and its nice but as i was putting it on i could hear seems popping it was weird because i wasnt forcing them on and they werent tight also they are super loose around the ankle still a nice material and very comfortable though,0
it does the trick but there smaller then what they look like in the pic br it dont have a very dramatic lookbr i figured its more for children,1
the shoes came with no shoe laces plus the shoe box was ripped and seemed used,0
lovely but stiff and scratchy could not handle the strap on my neck a waste of money,0
very cute boots but ran a little small returned for bigger size and the process went smooth,2
beautifulwould fit great on smallmedium wrists,2
not the greatest quality they were scratchy and stiff they might have washed up nice i didnt because i am returning them,1
cute and thick shoes that go on easily we only needed them for one day so unsure how long they will last,2
not girls size need to hand heading,2
ring was nice weight and was comfortable but had a little more industrial look than i liked so many people raved about this ring that i took a chance on liking it shipping and customer service were great i returned it in its orginal packing envelope,1
i dont know if i just have extra long ears or if i was wearing them incorrectly but they were really short they wont stay on my ears they are really cute though if you have small ears lol,1
i received these glasses yesterday when i opened the shipping package the case was crushed in on one side the coach emblem came off on one side and the lens on one side is scratched im going to be asking for a refund if it wasnt for those issues id absolutely love them so disappointed,0
paper thin,1
ran small,1
the interior fabric started to degraded within the first 6 months now that i have better slippers i thought it best to take a photo and show it to others before i throw them in the trash,0
very sexy,1
the soles cracked within a week of wearing them bummer another downer is the complete lack of traction in these they are very slick,0
i am going to have to alter it ridiculously large it is a onesizefitsall and im a 810 very disappointed,0
its cutebigger than i expected definitely too big to be considered a clutch will be great for a beachpool smaller bag but definitely not a regular every day bag will keep it because of the price but if it had been more expensive i probably would have returned it,1
i dont know how this seller managed to take the photos of these earrings that they put on amazon but these earrings do not look like those photos these earrings are teeny tiny they are so small they are not even suitable for my youngest granddaughters all the nice detail in the amazon photos is not evident in these earrings these are so tiny you cannot tell what the design is on them,0
gifted,1
this top is ok its a shiny type of fabric not the warm flannel i was expecting my fault should have read the description better im a 38ddd so when i put it on it doesnt really conform to my figure the way i would like so ill be using this as more of a lounge at home shirt,1
amazing pair of leggings for a good price definitely glad i bought them will be buying more,2
i liked everything fit cut price but i really didnt like the fabric,0
got it as present and love it just what i expected very comfy,2
its not breathable,0
love it fits well looks great used it for summer time lay it flat for a day or two so it gets its shape back from being shipped,2
dont buy this leggings they are super sheer and they ripped on me with just one use thank goodness i was at home and not at the gym there goes my money down the toilet because i cant ever use them again,0
nice material runs big,1
these are good for hospital but better for summer and not warm,2
i did not get all of the socks and the package was damaged,0
these are super cute and once you cut out the tags why do they still sew itchy tags into underwear they are comfortable except for the fact they are a bit tight around the rib cage they are one size fits all and i find that hard to believe considering im under 110 pounds and a size 2 and these are tight on me i cant wear them all day bc they start to bother me i suppose maybe they are for teenagers,1
most poorly made item i ever bought on amazon chain broke metal snap doesnt work terrible waste of money,0
i bought three of these one for me and the other two for my cousin and aunt as a gift mine brokebr the week i got it it is an easy fix so for the money it is a great buy,1
its that cheap bad fabric which is not how it looks in the picture poorly made the sizing is bizarre i ordered my size id say it came about 2 sizes too big im returning the same day it was delivered,0
too tight not flattering at all wouldnt recommend,0
it really runs small go up a size are 2 but it looks nice less are a bit large at the bottom had to send it back didnt t work for me,1
they came entangled they didnt fit my ears at allbr too light they dont stay on ears,0
the bracelet is very pretty i suggest you gently side on the first few times as it takes awhile for it to stretch out enough to go over your hand i ordered the regular size and it fits how id like just doesnt stretch enough for the first few times i do love it,2
for the price these shoes are amazing light but with great stability the only negative i would have would be the soles wear out quickly 23 months with daily wear seller had them to my door in less than 72 hours awesome,2
very loose not meant for smaller or slimmer heads very thin and non very soft no covid protection,0
i got the black los angeles sweater it fit as expected based on the reviews and pictures its just not flattering the material is very thin and the cut is horrible i wouldnt recommend,0
these are the cutest leg warmers ever bought as a gift perfect for younger ladies in the family i had no idea what to get for christmas,2
not happy because its transparentbra totally visible,0
these boots were terrible they fit fine very cute however the smell is so bad i can not wear them they have been sitting outside since i got them i will never wear them,0
it is to big and to small at the same time i know i have a booty but why lol i returned it,0
thick drawstring that allows me to carry the bag with ease without cutting mybr shoulder i use forbr gym and i like the material,2
looks great however it didnt make it through an entire night before two of the clips on the back broke off it is plastic so no easy way to reattach,1
i wish it was a thicker quality cotton,1
the first day i wore these shoes i wore them for 12 hrs they were comfortable and did great i would get another 2 pair but the colors i want were not available,2
wrist band broke,0
there were some areas that did not match the picture which made a big difference in the fit i tried to return and it was sent back to me after i paid to have it sent via ups because it was not covered by the seller,0
nice fitting shoe otherwise returned for something else,1
very very very small,1
delivery was incredibly quick product not what i wanted,0
too small dont buy it,0
better than expected really nice for the price,2
middle of the road on these boots they looked nice enough nothing special about them they fit snug in the toe but loose on the heel i ended up returning them figured i would spend the money on a pair that at least fit better,1
this is a decent sweater although it definitely has a casual look to it it is not very fitted in the waist but it is comfortable and warm it does look good with jeans its a good staple to have on hand for cool winter daysnights looks good with a turtleneck under it or a tee like shown on the model picture,2
this didnt fit at all i dont know about you but im not built like a pyramid my breast are rounded not pointed i guess they must work for someone but not for me i was glad i could return,0
item did not fit description they fit fine and i kept them but the tag says 40 polyester 60 cotton made in china item has drawstring no fly the brand is listed as cyz,1
thanks she finally got it and loves it,2
the fit was good and the color was beautiful but the fabric was much thinner than i expected and showed too many bumpsripples for my liking though i typically wear thicker compression leggings so maybe im just used to that and the smoothing effect those have still 4 stars because they are great quality leggings just didnt work for me,2
a little too small for large pendants but okay for certain earrings a little too small for a small pendant and small earrings together which i wanted to use it for i guess ill have to wait for my other order from amazon of a little larger pendantearring case in white faux leather which is taking forever to get here,0
just received my 5th pair of bootcut lucky brand jeans love them however this new pair midrise sweet bootcut shrunk a bit in length after washing drying them as i have with my other lb jeans the label is a bit different but it could just be a new version they also say relaxed fit and are not at all i am 57 and the lucky brand 32 is usually good for my height until this pair since i have washed them already i will be keeping them but just wanted to warn other shoppers on the variances,1
its very warm but so puffy my son is barely mobile while wearing it,1
not the same green as pictures,1
the label on the package said the correct info for what i ordered but the badge holder was only 3 diameter just returned it via a ups store,1
basic g string with really expensive lettering that flakes badly regardless of care taken wear 5 times and no lettering anymore gentle handwash,2
material is rough itchy,0
it fit really well better than most since my size is hard to find but after a while the fabric became more and more uncomfortable im having to return it because i just couldnt stand it,1
for years i had a brighten wallet that i loved as it wore out i looked at other wallets and just couldnt find one i liked as much i even had the zipper repaired it finally got to a point that i had to replace my wallet so the search began upon finding this beautiful wallet i gave it a try it is perfect it has smooth leather that looks great the wallet has every feature that my old wallet had plus rfid blocking i couldnt be happier,2
very comfortable fit as expected would buy again,2
i bought this to wear under a form fitting dress i ordered the size based upon the size chart it is far too big and provides little to no support i kept it because it might be nice to wear under certain skirts but it is far too loose i suppose it is my mistake because the name 34comfort slip34 should have implied that it offers little to no 34firm support34 this would be perfect if you are looking for something comfortable with a small bit of support,1
these shorts should be labeled as slim cut my husband has always worn a size 36 but these size 36 were too small on the waist and cut tight on the legs we returned them,1
i have a decently large wrist so i had no chance of this being of use for me as it seams to be more for children,0
there cheap made not worth the money,0
update it did actually come completely off when i was in a lake i did ultimately find my watch but only after the water killed itbr br original very comfortable and a good fit but the band keeps coming undone thankfully it hasnt fallen off yet because it stops before completely opening but its really annoying as it can happen a few times in an hour sometimes i cant figure out how to make it stay on or why its not secure,0
broke off in my hand,0
used to buy these items from another vendor quality is not up to the others standards and price range is the same,1
cheap super thin run large see through,0
the belt looks much wider in the pictures still its pretty the one thing that kinda sucks is it came with a terrible stench that i cant get rid of so far so i havent even been able to wear it,1
i was excited about this shirt until i received it the print quality is low and the size runs small i ordered a large and it still fit but feels more like a medium on i didnt return it because for the price it wasnt worth the hassle,0
looks just like photo only complaint fabric lints up after 1st wearing,1
size is great fabric is not as expected,1
i really love maidenform bras this one in particular is so so so comfortable the band is smoothing and doesnt dig into your sides and make you have armpit fat the cups are very seamless under clothing as well my only gripe is that i do wish it was lined a little bit more on the cups,2
excellent product and super fast shipping no complaints,2
my husbands favorite scrub pants,2
these dont fit like womens pants they fit my husband better than they fit me the sizes they offer are strange 33 x 31 for example which is how menswear is sized,0
this sweater is not off the shoulder the neck line is actually pretty tight and the sweater is see threw,0
the crotch seam fell apart after first wear,0
conceptually a brilliant idea but poorly executed imo made from cheap materials w rough craftsmanship and a measly design that wont fit most heads i suspect maybe young kids and women but not designed to fit on a mans noggin,0
fits perfect loves his new look and fits like a 2xlt should fit i have to do more ironing but he looks good and they hold up in a warehouse environment as a lead,2
i was looking for a dress for my nephews graduation this dress fits great maybe a little loose in the chest the material has a little stretch and breaths great,2
it came exactly as pictured perfect size for a first or second grader the little doll that came with it was deformed looking and the jewel was off her dress but the backpack itself seems to be well made,2
cute and comfortable,2
really cute for the price but gold color rubs off super fast,0
i am just getting back to running after a few years of cycling only i was looking for shoes that were flexible and would help to minimize impact while i worked to get my form back thankfully the recommendation of these shoes paid off they have a soft feel and help promote a proper running style i had some knee pain issues with some asics i ran in right before these and the realflex speeds have completely eliminated the pain for me these help promote more of a midsole strike which definitely helps to minimize impact i would recommend them to anyone looking for more of a natural feeling running shoe,2
i even got this two sizes too small for me and i was still too big it looks like im pregnant i kept them even though i didnt like them but just want to hassle with trying them if i were to buy them again i definitely would book go at least three sizes too small,0
husbands favorite watch hard to find locally hes delighted that i found it on amazon,2
seriously buy this larger than you are xdbr specially if youre using it while pregnant i bought it several sizes bigger so it would flow and not be snugbr its definitely cheap material wise but it doesnt look like itbr havent taken my pictures yet since im waiting to be at least 32 weeks to take them but i love how it feels,2
better than the ones that attach to your socks would be these again,2
these are great quality substantial fabric and longer torso but the vneck starts to stretch and not rest flat after a while amazon needs to rethink this part of the styling,1
my daughter is a very petite 3 year old who normally fits 3t clothing and can get away with smaller in waist size i ordered the 24 t thinking that she would have plenty of room to move around since the next size up is a 46x it barely fits if she grows another inch in her torso it wont pull up over her shoulders the material is super thick and doesnt stretch much so she wont get much time out of it im interested to see how much bigger the next size up is good thing target sells a 4t leotard for when she grows out of this one,1
not large enough,1
brought them to wear outside when going to store or any outing but theyre to big so im giving them awayvery comfortable though,1
i love the fabric of these pants and have these in grey that fit amazing however for some reason my pink ones i bought are much larger and baggy im a little disappointed since they cost so much not sure why they are cut different than the other ones i have,1
the plastic doesnt tighten loose hanging useless couldnt play tennis with loose shoes strings do not recommend,0
havent tried them on ice yet but they are very comfortable wearing heavy socks with them doesnt work they would be too snug so i wear more lightweight socks and my feet are still warm bought a pair of replacement insoles but they also make the shoe too snug,2
nice and warm,2
wrong size the opening appears to be too small attractive boot i would be glad to wear if it fit,1
very flattering and comfortable love the long sleeves and length i am 57 and 120lbs ordered a small,2
omg i love these mittens so cute so warm i love them,2
loved it,2
fits as it should its long which i like so it doesnt creep up when you bend over comfy too,2
cute idea but the image is really pixelated which makes it look cheap br returned,0
decent dress but hugs every roll i have,1
second shirt ive ordered from this company pleased,2
this product was a gift the arms are a bit long but the person receiving the coat fixed that in less than a minute he loves this coat and it is very flattering on him theres enough room to layer when it gets colder it feels so soft inside its a win thank you,2
i matched it with a pair of jeans,2
i guess cause i ordered the wrong size it smashes my chest down and doesnt feel comfortable as i hoped it would,1
i ordered the size i normally wear with all jackets and tops fit was great wore it in alaska in the fall was rain resistant not waterproof but worked great with the light rains packed easily in my backpack lightweight but warm,2
irritating inseam lining not real fleece alao not warm as other products keep shopping,1
you get what you pay for but its a thoutful gift a nice scripture and the rhinestones are very pretty,1
keep in mind bali runs small 36c buy 40c and it will be perfect or large on lg md sml types of sizes i have bought bali for years and have learned this buy right size and you wont find a more comfortable bra,2
didnt fit the ear well very small jewelry,0
beautiful dress arrived quickly and wellpacked prettier in persongreat price be aware that in order to get the fullness in the skirt show in pics you will need to purchase a petticoat thing otherwise poof is minimal,2
i wanted something warm to keep my feet warm these are wonderfulwarm but soft i also like the colors i would order these again,2
this chain is absolutely gorgeous it is a 1mm so obviously is a delicate piece of jewelry and should be treated with care it looks very delicate and it sparkles with the light there is no way you can beat the price for the quality,2
sort of a boxy fit soft and lightweight not a bad buy for the money,2
the sf is extremely small and the rubber is thinner quality than i expected im going to contact amazon as far as a return,0
i usually wear a medium but my measurements seemed closer to a small for this dress so i ordered a small it fit me well but the belt would have been too big for anyone with a smaller waist than me and my waist is an inch or two bigger than the measurements listed for the small the dress doesnt have any belt loops so just keep that in mind for the belt too the dress wrinkles incredibly easily i only wore it for a few hours and when i got home it looked like itd been sitting crumpled up in my dirty clothes hamper for a few days before i wore it maybe starching it would help but im not sure overall its a cute dress but it does have some issues,1
i usually wear 8 long levis the length is great waist is fine yet after wearing a few hours they stretch out so the crotch drops so a belt is needed yet a smaller size would be to tight,1
too large had to return it,0
ick i dont think i need to say more than 95 polyester it feels icky on and would definitely make me sweat more in the summer heat if theyd choose a nice jersey fabric this would be a great dress,0
to small no directions on how to increase wrist band size,1
this is inexpensive but i hoped it would look like better quality material,1
fits well and true to size but if youre looking for a winter sweatshirt this isnt it very thin,2
i ordered my regular size and they do not fit right they hurt my feet and i do not wear them if it was not so much trouble to return them i would cannot recommend,1
nice shoe,2
i love this sweatshirt i ordered a large and i love how it fits i dont like my sweatshirts fitted its just big enough to be comfortable but not bulky big im 5534 and 135 it is super soft on the inside and its a perfect thickness,2
i like the design of this shirt but not the material the material is kind of clingy and not flattering its also weirdly shiny the tag says cottonpolyester but it feels and looks like some kind of spandex blend,1
break easy,1
the has doesnt stay closed so i had to bend the shape of them to make them stay,1
uggs are great second slippers,2
love this sweatshirt long sleeves and long length fits perfectly,2
arrived in time and is exactly as described i love it,2
wanted to love these shoes but they disappointed me in both fit and wearability the height was good and created a sexy casual look with ankle length pants but sadly had to face the fact that they are cheap and not meant to be practical the soles outside are really narrow and need to be worn with caution slick and very unstablewobbly no padding on the inside and the left shoe was tighter and uncomfortable aches in the arch area within 15 mins of wearing around the house whereas right felt great i wore with thin socks they are really cute but am returning as they are not worth a broken ankle,0
im 59 and these looked super cute on all the short instagram influencers unfortunately when i tried them on they were above my ankle and looked kind of silly i ended up returning them,1
good,2
fall apart in laundry i have 10 pair half fall apart in laundry,0
love love love it,2
is good quality bot too small,1
cheaply made i guess it is ok for a backup lid you get what you pay for sometimes more often than not you get less than you paid for meh,1
an ok slipper but runs very large,1
not as nice quality as id expected but im keeping it,1
everything was okay except for the sleeves they were too short i had to send it back plus i ended up getting charged twice for this item and i still havent got that worked out,1
the shoes are fairly comfy but if you have flat feet these give you zero support i have the ones that are denim material and what i dont like is if they get damp or wet once dried they shrink and you also cant wash them for this same reason,1
did not like that it says adjustable cord when in fact the one i got is not adjustable at all and its extremely short im a big guy and it just barely drops below my chin,0
fit great good lenth,2
graphic is great but shirt is short and material on the thin side runs a hair on the small side,1
thie product looks great on the model but for those of us who need some help looking a little slimmer and less blocky well this doesnt work so well i found the wires to be in the wrong place too low and digging in the removeable cups were all over the place really why would anyone remove the cups and the inner bra was not supportive enough i got some tummy control but the way my body filled it i looked like a block instead of showing off a little bum bottom seams were disappointingly unfinished meaning the swimsuit will maybe last a season i just expect a little better after having two swimdress style suits from this brand i really need that empire waist and a line,1
i gave these earrings a 3 rating because i did not purchase them from amazon but they look identical otherwise it wouldve been a 5 received my earrings put them on wore them overnight woke up with really sore ears bright red spots which have turned into knots and sores have been treating for four days and no better i do not have sensitive skin i have used magnetic products before with good results these hurt,1
i ordered according to the detailsthe shoes were entirely too big for my son,0
i was looking for a bra that i could wear with lower cut tops and thought this bra would work well due to the front close low cut i have purchased front close bras before so i knew what to expect as far as how they would shape my breasts depending on how a bra is cut it can make you look cone shaped round pushed together with lots of cleavage or separated the front close bras have a tendency to make your boobs separate and look further apart i am a full 34d to small 34dd and this bra definitely makes them appear further apart but that is not a problem for me the bra is made a of very soft stretchy material so it is also very comfortable however and a big however the material is very cheap and after only wearing it 2 times it started pilling getting fuzzies and also snagged i definitely would expect better quality from bali i am surprised no one else has mentioned this unless they left theyre review before washing i wash in a lingerie bag and hang to dry so i am was really disappointed in the quality however i purchased 5 of them and have such a hard time finding bras that fit and are comfortable that i decided to keep them i figure for 20 each it is worth it if i wear it for a few months before it is ready to be thrown away i would spend 60 for a bra at nordstrom that lasts a year so economically it makes sense for me to keep them if you want a bra that will lasthold up and still look good this is not the one for you,0
im 6 ft 160 lbs 34c and couldnt even put this on cup size is maybe a small b very narrow across the front so as often happens id have to get a ridiculously large size to get correct cup size but then it would dig into my arm pits and be loose around the band so im returning and not replacing its an attractive looking top if you can fit into it properly,0
love this coat just wish i would of ordered a size smaller it runs very large,2
it is lightweight enough that im not sweating during church but warm enough that i can wear it outside during the winter i love the length pockets and print i will be buying another one soon,2
so hard to shop for these items on amazon size was off but easy return policy also hard when bra size is like 44b because the bras lose their attractiveness in style and look,0
i really like these earrings if you like tulips then you should buy these,2
ultra low is an understatement the no slip on the heel wasnt effective horrible socks,0
very comfortable ordered half size up but needed a full size bigger,1
everything,0
shiny and slinky who lounges in shiny fabric i returned it immediately,0
i like this comfortable yet looks nice,2
great fit it was perfect,2
way to big no one wants a punching glove keychain that you cant put into your pocket i wont be using this keychain,0
my nephew absolutely loved it,2
muy buen producto,2
very cheaply made returned product,0
cheap script not to pretty,1
just received it and the color is not as shown in the picture i ordered quotstonequot but the purse is greysilver other than being disappointed about the color i like the rest of the bag the strap is easily adjustable side pockets fit standard size water bottles lots of interior room for phonewalletsweater and the exterior appears that it would wipe clean easily i cant comment on the durability only time will tell the quality,2
these feel like plastic they are for theatrical purposes for me so they will do the job they are not for regular wearing i would say,1
way to small for youthdidnt fit 9 year old much less a 13 year old,0
cute but hard for little hands,0
these are great the fit look and the light weight is perfect for the tropical climate i live in after laundering they look just fine to wear unlike so many linen shirts that look like they were balled up wet and left to dry i will buy more as needed,2
cute top i ended buy buying another in a different color,2
great,2
i was so excited when i got this from the mail it fits perfectly its look exactly what i seen on the pictures that i reviewed i ordered xl just in case but its great fits me well,2
i liked the look and feel of the coat except that it was too long im 52 and the coat was longer than mid thigh darn the luck,1
for a knockoff of a killstar sweater its decent its not as long and very itchy but i bought it to hold me over until i can get the killstar one the original is 50ish bucks so you can see why i got this one for now also the material besides feeling like steel wool is very flimsy and you have to be careful with it just putting it on made it come undone in some spotsbr i think this one would be cute for halloween or something but its just not for me,1
please do not waste your time and money getting this dress it looks nothing like the picture and the back and front are both this weird unflattering vneck it also was way longer than excepted and i returned it within hours of receiving it,0
returned too small nice quality though,1
not what i expected from modern miss,1
never disappointment in nautica,2
once loaded with a normal amount cards and cash the wallet is too thick to foldbr needs to be taller instead of longerbr the extra bill slot is completely un needed and jist adds the the unnecessary thicknessbr im returning itbr its not for me,0
i literally couldnt get my daughter to take these boots off for the entire month she absolutely loves these boots they are great quality and water does not leak in we live in california so its too hot for her to wear them right now but when its cold she loves them,2
comfortable not sure i find them supportive enough for long term use as someone with foot and ankle issues i dont believe they are supportive enough but if you have no feet and ankle problems this would be a good shoe for you they are comfortable and warm and i like the warmth they are indeed waterproof too,2
like the cloth colour is great just like in the picture,1
love these boots fit perfectly to size i have larger calves and it was easy to fit different pants into them by just adjusting the buckles have worn them so far with leggings slim leg pants and jeans the finishing on the leather is a rich shiny mahogany beautiful ill be wearing them until they fall apart,2
quality wise this thing is really nice based on reviews i sized down and got a small in the navy color i shouldnt have im 57 and 145 and normally wear size 6 and for rompers i usually get medium this fit snug which isnt the style im going for im returning and going to try a medium,2
material was great til washed,1
i had ordered this to wear for a special event awaited excitedly for its arrival only to find out that the color does not match how it presented was hoping for the brighter cobalt blue hue but it was the darker duller navy blue instead it seemed like it was made with good solid material with a enough room to fit an ipad mini wallet and some accessories so sad that i had to return it due to the wrong blue hue,1
its pretty and fits as expected the material is not exactly as i expected its a bit heavier and bulkier then i intended despite that the color is nice and the blouse looks great its very cute,2
fits too tight for my liking,1
i purchased as it said leather upper suede is more like it i live in rain and snow suede will nite work leather will disappointed,1
did not last long,0
i really love this dress i was very surprised that i did after reading all the negative reviews about it i wouldnt have ordered it if i had read them before i had already had it arrived weeks ahead of the estimated delivery date it fits me perfectly and it hangs beautifully on me i was concerned that it may not be floor length the way i like my maxis to be but it is i am 57 110lbs and i ordered it in a small when it arrived it was all squished up in a plastic bag so i figured it was going to be a wrinkled up mess but it didnt have a wrinkle it may say that it is a cotton blend but i would say it is more rayon i was almost going to deduct a star because i dont care for the way they hemmed the bottom of it but i couldnt tell once i put the dress on the rest of the seams are prefect and straight when i put this dress on i was looking in the mirror with the sunlight coming thru the door behind me and i couldnt see thru it but just to be on the safe side of modesty i will wear a slip with it idk maybe i was one lucky girl that got a beautiful well made non see thru dress thank you for taking your time to read my review of this dress,2
the gel seating is outstanding but size up they run really small,1
i ordered this product based on the good reviews and because it was specifically described as longleg as soon as i opened the package and took the boxer briefs out i noted that they were anything but longleg i measured all 5 pair and in each pair the inseam was approximately 178 inch in length maybe longleg when compared to tidy whitey briefs i returned them and purchased hanes longleg boxer briefs which are considerably cheaper and from past experience very comfortable,0
this necklace looked semi cheap when i received it after my grandson wore it it turned so nasty even silver polish didnt help the chain is the same waybr my daughter bought one as well for my grandsons friend same thing happened dont waste your money,0
comfortable shoes,2
liked the fabric and seem well made but didnt like the slim fit im an older 70 women and dont like to see underwear seams dont think a larger size would have made a difference,1
im embarrassed to have purchased this garbage but would have been irredeemably mortified if i had been the one who sold it,0
love them just a tiny bit big and im a straight 7 but they are very comfortable,2
many different sellers are selling this item some pretend it is 34steve mcqueen34 but alas they are just steve mcchinese knock offs i am always surprised by confounded reviewers shocked the item they recieved doesnt look like the photo that was obviously stolen from the authentic website and horribly photoshopped to show the different colors anytime you see an obscure seller or company name yet miraculously they have a pretty american californiacasual model in a picture thats been horribly cut from another image you should probably not be shocked when you dont get the exact item in that picture ive been amazoning for a long time and i feel like i figured out pretty quickly the hard way how to differentiate truth from china so that being said i get annoyed when people are still naive about this kind of stuff and then give negative reviewsbr br however that does not necessarily mean that you wont get a decent item anyway ive had many purchasing experiences where i totally accepted that it was probably going to be a terrible knock off version but just didnt really care and would have purchased it anyway if id seen it at a store this is kind of one of those itemsbr br the cardigan is great i mean within 2 seconds you can tell it is not the item from the picture but if i never saw the original picture and they were just honest about the item god forbid id still have gotten it i have been stuck in a nicu and picu with my son for 4 12 of the last 6 months in miami fl it is 90 degrees outside and negative 90 degrees inside i have had no access to my actual closet at home so i am forced to buy new things here and there as instances come up and people bring me stuff from the house if they visit i had only one yes one actual cardigan with me this entire time unimaginable and its not even a short one its kind of long so it kind of doesnt fit with a lot of things this cardican is good because it is longer than a standard button up cardigan but it is shorter than the thigh length one i have now i wanted something with casual t shirty material to wear with jeans or a casual dress this is perfect yes i like the item they are knocking off and wish it was that but this is perfectly finebr br unlike a lot of chinese knock off items this one actually fits true to size if you want it to be a little slumpier get it bigger but it is a good fit i dont wear cardigans buttoned bc that is jsut a really uflattering look on me and my stomach isnt nearly firm enough to not have the muffin top bulge front and center so unbuttoned it is but i like it that way anywaybr br overall it is absolutely a knock off item and not the item,1
runs small up the size maybe by two,1
seemed a little flimsy easy to break the first time i dropped it it broke,1
not really for curvy women oh well i guess it just didnt fit right for me and my curvy body,1
great fit and cut but it is super see through,0
very poor quality the brim is uneven and does not hold any type of form,0
love it especially for the price,2
they arent durable at all,0
this would be a nice wallet especially for the money if the two exterior slots actually kept cards from creeping out when in ones pockets andor being taken out and inserted into the front pockets of ones pants the leather is excellent quality and the id window does a great job of keeping the id in place size is perfect for a front pocket wallet will hold a halfdozen cards plus receipts and a halfdozen or more bills without being bulky,0
it honestly looked different on the website than it did in person it was really thin too i returned it before trying it on,0
i have been using accuratic winders for a nearly a decade i have 7 of the first generation ones and 10 of the second generation ones aluminum housing they are the best winders on the market if you ever need to add more they are modular with the right coupling pieces you can have 1 or 20 the newest models are even better and more refined than the first generation plastic ones better watch holders even quieter if that was possible and more customizable now i did have a small issue with one of of the winders i just ordered i emailed the company they called me right away the next morning apologized explained that they are built to be easily user serviceable and they are sending me all the parts to remedy the issue right away i couldnt be happier i would recommend getting felt pads for the bottom of the winders because the edges are anodized aluminum and could mark woodbr br update after about 6 months ive had 4 motor failures support has been good at least for the first 3 motors,1
a little thinner than i expected but its holding up just fine,1
i really like this loungedress or mu mu will be purchasing more,2
soft and cozy this is a quality scarf with a lot of versatility it looks high quality and feels so nice the color is true to what i see on the screen maybe a tad bit lighter but not a different color entirely,2
these were very comfortable i was looking for yoga shorts that are low rise these wouldve worked great except they fit more like underwear than shorts and a little bit of my butt cheeks showed at the bottom lol if they were just a hair longer i wouldve kept them,1
i didnt like the quality cheap looking,0
perfect fit,2
the cups are way too small for the size of the shirt my husband said it made my boobs look deformed,0
the metal peace on the belt broke off its not made very good faulty design its not easy to tighten up on your waste i ordered 2 of them i think i will be sending them back i dont recommend wasting your money on this belt not worth it maybe try a different brand this one is not worth the money,0
arrived broken so cheaply made,0
this is a fine looking and high quality 34jeans34 belt it arrived in a nice presentationstyle box,2
ordered a medium and it was too big,1
i enjoy these belts they are comfortable and easy to wear,2
my son was not ready wear this short pant by seeing the designs on that initially he refused to wearbr br after on wash the color was as bright as the new when i got in the pack but the size was reduced it shrinks and was small and no more it fit my son,1
the mask looks great n looks like its strong n not a cheap plastic the only problem was that the shipping process took to long,1
not really teal more turquoise blue,1
it was broken when it was delivered absolutely no use to me,0
its really warm but a little to small still like it though,1
there are so many choices for bandanas on amazon in hindsight this should have been a product i purchased locally i do like that these bandanas are 100 cotton and the print is on both sides however these were not as thick as i expected i use bandanas when i go camping they serve as a towel when im cooking a kerchief when im hiking and occasionally as a kleenex for my nose as these bandanas as so thin i doubt they will be useful for any of these uses except maybe as my cooking towel im sure i will find other uses for them and i will be visiting a local store to purchase 100 cotton think bandanas that better suit my needs,1
even though a nice quality piece of steel i ordered it because it does not have grooves guess what they lied the measurements are groovedbr since i dont want to go through the hassles of returning it i will use it and hope it does not mar my coin rings,0
compartment for change a little awkward would have been better with zipper on opposite side,1
the shirts are soooooo thin in material that they are seethrough i returned them,0
the fit is great in this dress but the material is stiff and smells of plastic shower curtain i will wash it and see if it doesnt improve the skirt has a lovely swing and the scoop neck is low without being obscene,1
the size and colors were okbr the material very poor quality,1
the colors are brilliant and bright but the fabric is very thinbr br im afraid it will rip and i wouldnt want to carry anything too heavy either i am somewhat disappointed in how thin the fabric is and also the overall length of the strap which isnt adjustable the rating is purely due to the thinness of the fabricbr i wouldnt say that i totally regret the purchase its a beautiful bag really and i will be wearing it this spring and summer i just dont think it will make it to next year but for the cost i am ok with this i might even adjust the bag myselfbr there is a pocket on the strap for a cellphone and pockets inside the bag that can be used for a wallet but the inner fabric is even thinner than the ohsothin outta fabricbr i may update this review as i get some use outta this bag,1
i gave this away on my local buynothing group the fit was really odd pulled my tatas to the side and the top of the bra was exceptionally high uncomfortable also there is stitching across the front of the boob that even though it was filled out fully puckered and showed badly through a tshirt would not recommend,0
the sleeves are tight as well as the bust so its all twisted up on me i have a 33 inch waist and around my bust measures 40 inches and my hip is 48 inches the dress specs for a large days the bust is 4173inches but the top half of this dress is a nono the sleeve width laid flat is 6 12 inches to the stitching 13 inches all around there is no give in this material either just the waist that has elastic length is okay i usually wear a large so thats what i got for this dress i only go up in dresses if it would add to the length but that wasnt the issue the top half is just wrong perhaps its best to go up a size so the sleeves fit better maybe then the bust would fit better,0
as others have said false advertising gloves were paper thin did not have the stitching in the picture and also dont seem to be shaped to fit the hands of a human,0
i liked the pattern and have a handful of lily dresses but this one ran a little snug for my taste,1
these pants are see through very very thin material for a return you have to pay 399 through usps so thats stupid this was a waste of money buyer beware,0
fits loosely fabric a bit lighter than i expected but comfortable you definitely need a shirt under for a cool day,2
connector sticks out past the edges verified i ordered right size,0
the stitches are starting to become unstitched or whatever the term is i only had them for 3 weeks washed twice trash,0
i was truly disappointed when i opened my package just holding it up i knew it wouldnt fit i wear an xl2x depending on type of shirtcut i ordered a 2x in this product and its more like a medium material is cheap looks nothing at all like the picture provided super bummed wish i could give it a half star rating what a waste,0
the shirt is a tad tight but fits pretty well and looks good but the color of the shirt in life isnt quite as white as it appears in the amazon photos the blue and red stripes are more prominent and darken the shirt a bit,1
zippers broke off in first trip and the medium sized luggage is not expandable which was another disappointing factor it looks very vulnerable after just one international trip,0
when i was reviewing this pair of shoes i saw that the reviews were in no way stellar but i ordered them thinking this is a quality brand i opened the wrapped box expecting a great pair of shoes oh heck no i wear a size 13 and ordered size 14 wide i could barely get my foot into the shoe not only are they tight but not comfortable either so take this from me avoid these shoes with all diligence youll be shipping them back in no time horrible,0
very cute but very thin and runs about two sizes small,1
comfortable and bright,1
very cheap they were all exactly alike,0
i bought these for my 10 year old daughter she loves them but they were huge they were too big for me and i wear a 758 in womens i want to reorder but am unsure now what size to get,1
as expected,1
a bit small but they stretch with age,2
nice material keeps you warm and protected nice shape and not bulky,2
not what i expected and then you have to pay to return itbr when its says free returnedbr very disappointed,0
color is wayyyyy darker than what is picture and wear a 38 and had to order a 42 to get a good fit these are the only two things that make them 4 stars quality is fantastic,2
my grandson loves it,2
the cups are pokey and pointed which most breasts are not i felt like a housewife from the 50s,0
the idea is pretty good but the execution is just okay we ended up not using these much in my household because that inner ring with the piece that curves inward is just enough of an extension that it can snag things inside pockets etc,1
very nice product will be doing more business with,2
great product it was just like they said i luv it,2
the watch looks great but stopped working piece of crapbr i am very disappointed,0
liked the material the colors the comfort and how it flatters any figure,2
unsure if the socks are really non skid socks,1
it not like the pictures its very tight and it take one phone the leather nice but wrong desgin,0
the stitching on these are so poor that they came apart within one weeks use at particular seams im suspecting that these were irregular items that couldnt make the quality control standards of brick and mortar stores avoid you were warned,0
i love these so much they are my goto pants th crotch does sit a little low so you need to wear them highwaisted which is a little annoying this then causes the pockets to sit low and can look a little funny if you arent wearing a longer top,2
my wifes laptopdocument wheelie bag trashed its wheels on a recent trip she was going to throw it out but i thought i could fix it these wheels did the trickbr br the wheels were an exact size replacement and i think have better bearings than the original wheels these wheels come with the axles and two allen key wrenches to install them this was a huge bonus because the old wheels had been riveted on i was wondering how i was going to replace them and was considering using a bolt and nut but amazon to the rescue with a wheel set and axles for a great pricebr br i dont know if i ever will need another set of luggage wheels but if i do this will be the first place i look,2
ordered for barristers ball loved how it looked like the star of an early taylor swift video in a good way but fit snug and had trouble with the zipper rubbing graphite on the teeth helped,2
after one week it broke,0
absolutely perfect,2
i feel like this ran very big my daughter is in 6 so i ordered 67 and it was huge on her,1
i am learning that i have to really pay attention to how items look size etc the picture looked like a heart but they actually look like triangles i returned them,1
this skirt is suppose to be knee length its tge wrjng skirt,0
runs short,1
comfortable but wont stay on feet customer service tells you to contact them with any problems but they wont respond to my emails,1
good item,1
glasses are good quality and they look really niceif you want that old school hip hop look these glasses are where its at,2
doesnt fit,0
doesnt work,0
run a little small material isnt great but ok,1
these are very cute shorts purchased my normal size small and i would say they fit tts material is nice soft and flowy a tad shorter than i would have liked but overall they are a good short,1
love them so much that i bought 3 more comfy has pockets that i love i wouldnt say its a lot of tummy control but i think if they were super tight i wouldnt enjoy wearing them,2
i would really like these if they didnt roll and ride up even the slightest movement i do they are up to my underwear line if you can get them to stay put they are cute,0
looks nothing like the photo shiny material and flimsy also runs small sent it back,0
i went from carpet to wood floors in my new home these slippers dont have much padding theres just enough to make them slightly comfortable i was hoping for chonky padding they are okay as a midrange comfort slipper,1
got this to replace my turtle fur balaclava which i lost big mistake this thing is made of neoprene it is stiff and not comfortable in cold snowy weather the moisture freezes on it and it gets hard and icy i ended up buying another turtle fur,0
these re a little hard for me to get in but the colors are nice,2
this is a great skirt i normally wear a size 6 and ordered a small i would suggest going up one size for me it was too tight in the hips and i will be exchanging it for a medium it has a nice flare and is a good quality fabric you can roll over the top and make it longer or shorter,2
the bodysuits are perfect for a tall two year old,2
love the large numbers good looking watch,2
i love these hats i brought 4 different colors soft stylish cute warm great fit love,2
the arms of this dress fits very tightly,1
poor qualitycolor fades,0
cute style just make sure to order a size up im a 34 cd and ordered a med which the top was a lil small bottoms were good im a 9 in juniors jeans,1
cute but not flattering 511 165 lbs and made me lumpy,1
i was looking for a comfortable pair of leggings just to wear around the house these felt like they were going to rip as soon as i pulled them up over my legs i would just rather get some super soft ones at walmart not a fan,0
i shoulda figured 100 cotton s ironing i hand wash and air dry but they come out wrinkly they are soft and thick not a tradoff for me,0
product runs a little small compared to competitors stitching is good pockets fit a large smart phone,2
they are a little heavier than expected but overall really good especially for the price and are really warm,1
there isnt a front and back on the sweater you can wear however you put it on be aware it has dropped shoulders,1
i have never been able to find a sports bra thats comfortable fits looks good this sports bra meets all expectations,2
cute and comfortable,2
these are actually purple not gray but are super cute and comfy they run big wish they had more than one size very well knitted very soft and warm,2
it broke the first time i put it on i contacted the seller to return it but i never heard back so i wasted my money,0
ripped at the seam the 2nd or 3rd time i used them kept using them anyway the padding is in the right spot for road riding,0
bought a few months ago and when i got it out to wear it it has a hole where the cuff is sewn on the sleeve but time is up to send back ill check my items right away from now on,1
my daughter has been using this on overnight trips it fits a set of clothes and all her toiletries phone charger etc it has separate zippered pouches for small items the straps are comfortable and the zippers pull smooth without catching its a flat matte black color so its not a loud accessory,2
smell of dress is horrible washed 2 times still smells of burning chemical smell unable to wear unfortunately i had school stuff and travel and missed my window od return by 2 days,0
i like the mary jane strap,2
this sweater had a great cut but the pattern of the knit didnt exactly look like the picture it fit as expected so order your size i returned but only because upon receiving it looked to similar to something i already owned,1
so cute i love it,2
when i ordered it i couldnt wait to get it when i got it in the mail it was like christmas in august it was def big looks fancy and expensive i had to remove 5 linksthats the only down fall no arrows to show which way to push and the watch was so big u have to use different equipment to adjust it other wise its an attention magneteye catcher sometimes i dress up just so i can wear the watch,2
ordered a large felt like a xl ordered a medium felt like a small these amazon shirt printers are seriously garbage they all use the worst possible t shirts to print graphics on its seriously annoying all of the worst shirts ive ever bought came from amazon sellers,0
large is an extra small,0
dont call it black leather when its pure plastic junk,0
too expensive found the same boots at urban king last weekend for 10 same exact boots,1
theyre a little snug but okay,1
larger than i expected i should have looked closer,0
blazer was cute but i couldnt wear it the sleeves were very tight returned,0
comfortable nice colors but thinner material shorter up the ankle than expected,1
one size does not fit all,0
i really do not like these shoes they are not comfortable to walk in at all they are very well made and sturdy they look nice on but not in the least bit comfy i gave them away,0
the elastic band is weird it rolls upwards and it makes the skirt higher the fabric is really thick which is nice because it wont be see through it is a little on the short side,0
disappointed the zipper separates from teeth it can be zipped back together but i find it frustrating its a nice bag,0
i love this scarf light weight good length,2
they fit and look cute but the material is kind of plastic feeling and very thin if i knew they felt like this i wouldnt have purchased i dont think theyll last long,1
i ended up returning this jumpsuit it just didnt fit well overall and i also didnt know it wasnt a full pant the pant stops just above the ankle,0
item must be plugged in heating pad separate not incorporated in the gloves material that holds the heating pad in place under the gloves is extremely cheap,1
if you have exactly the right body type for this and pair it with the right shoes accessories hair and makeup then this would make an absolutely fire outfit on its own or on other body types though it looks kind of cheapbr br it is actually pretty flattering so if youre bigger dont let that scare you away but be prepared to show out if you want to look good in it youve got to rock it with confidencebr br this is very thin material i cant tell if its cheap or meant to be light cool and breezy it definitely is cool for the summer if you can pull it off and if you rock it with confidence and the right look it could be a 5 star outfit just be preparedbr br the material has no give or stretch aside from the waist band of the pants which is very forgiving it does fit true to size though so feel free to order as usual,1
danced all night in these at my girlfriends wedding didnt have to take them off,2
feels good and pretty,1
i liked these earrings but the pink is alot lighter than the picture on my computer,2
you have to know this is shipped from china and it will take over a month to be delivered good quality and imprints you have to order 1 or 2 sizes up,2
daughter loved it picked it out because of the fun prints and the doll robebr however for the price i wouldve expected better quality material is super thin like dollar store blanket thinbr just a couple of days old and it already is tearing in the pocketbr i would save my money and not purchase this item but if youre child really wants it i guess,1
overall the hat has nice look and feel to it the only problem is the clasp it looks cheap its the antique buckle type which means cheapest thing they could find it feels and looks like it i enjoy wearing the hat but im a little embarrassed when people see the back of it,1
these are soft yoga pants the fabric is lovely with a nice hand feel to it however the front to back rise in the pants has a most uncomfortable seam that makes it impossibly uncomfortable to wear just around the house i wouldnt think about wearing them for yoga practice the vendor needs to correct this problem as well as some shortness in the leg and loose ankle fit,0
the frame was twisted because the sunglasses were just put in a heavy envelope instead of a box i was going to send it back but i was able to remove the screw and re set the lense in the frame so i think it will be ok even though i blemished the area on the metal with the screw driver im surprised they didnt get completely crushed in shippingbr as for the glasses themselves i ordered these because i owned the exact pair previously and are my favorite sunglasses ive owned for the moneyquality peppers has a nice replacement warranty and nice products that you dont have to break the bank over,1
i really like the styling of this watch subdued but sportsoutdoorsoriented its very featurerich with indiglo backlight multiple alarms timersstopwatch etc the buttons are easy to push and large enoughbr br the main disappointment is the way the band is constructed its attachment points are sewn to the watch body two years later the rubberized plastic finally broke and there is no way to replace it with another watch bands it is basically a throwaway watch regardless of the nice features,1
love them the fit is just right will buy other colors,2
sizing is very small but quality is good up to 2 sizes bigger is better,1
purchased as a gift perfect fitting soft fleece jacket at an awesome price,2
pretty purple soft and comfortable,2
bought an xl for size 13 shoes per the size guidelines on the allen edmonds site way too small,0
after a few uses the stretch goes away will not recommend,1
i am 53 160 pound and i ordered the small the dress looks amazing i got the grey one the material is perfect i am getting the navy one too,2
these aprons were cute but the ties are grossgrain ribbon and very wide,2
bad,0
returned and ordered different style too big and ordered size i alway wear with sketchers,1
seems like decent quality but i ordered it 2 sizes too big its still small i ordered it so she could use it now or when she grows into it my daughter has a long build at that,1
great gift for a doctor who fan,2
i should have paid attention to the reviews and my history with swiss gear ive torn up some of their stuff in the past from light use and thought maybe this would be different nope i really liked the idea of the hidden information and thought it looked good first off the loop broke while putting it on super flimsy seriously worst loop ever on any luggage tag ive ever had second the area to write your info is super small if you are like me and have a long address or email you are out of luck unless you have tiny writing lastly its cheap plastic not impressed two stars for a neat design,0
i was really hoping this would work because i thought it was really cute however the fit is bad its shapeless and does nothing for you fits big im returning,0
my husband bought me the bear paw and i love it its lighter then i expected but still feels like pewter i love the design which is well stamped on it mine has an interesting double wave symbol on the back i dont know it would be there but it looks like a wave scene shrugs fine by me as i work with polar bear nice product cord material isnt bad ive had worse i i plan to put it on a tougher chaincord as it is my preference,2
bought a large size but it fits more like a medium size so i guess they run smaller than expected good reason to shed a few pounds i guess so thats a plus,2
very flattering and stylish,2
i bought as a gift and he really happy with the hat liked quality color etc etc,2
we bought this for our daughter to dress her up like emma wiggle for her first birthday its not exactly like the one she wears but it was very cute,2
we unfortunately had to return these because they are not slip resistant which is our reason for buying thembr other than not being slip resistant they are good looking comfortable and would have made a nice pair of work boots but without the slip resistant material theyre not worth keeping in our case,1
not as nice as it looks in the picture,1
long shirt for the nice falls and springs it does a good job of keeping you warm either in mild cold and for a under coat shirt conforms enough to your body so it feels nice and not like youre wearing a sack great for a go put on a sweater yell your dad always says when you approach the thermostat,2
perfect,2
i was frankly shocked that these were indeed genuine leather considering the ridiculously low cost but so far i have found no fault in them it takes a while to ship from china but definitely worth the wait,2
not as expected runs too big,1
love cottonmostly cotton socksmy feet can breathe better i just wish these were a bit bigger my feet are rather skinny too size 85 kind of tight and an effort to put on at first the other people are right they dont leave sock lines which is greatbr br to the companymanufacturer almost perfect socks please make wider easier to put onbr br updatebr with more washes they became even tighter even for my skinny feet i have to recycle them now we should probably never throw away and always recycle clothing in a donation bin for our planet,0
nothing like the picture,0
fits well didnt shrink in the wash id recommend this sweather,2
cute and a great value,2
these glasses look great got tons of compliments however less than 3 weeks later the lenses were excessively scratched and the frames began flakingpeeling i literally kept them in their microfiber pouch away from other items in my bags and made it a point to be very careful with them when using them flimsy quality as for the frames ive not experienced plastic that flakes and peels like this strange i will submit before and after pics later this style of sunglasses is great but purchase a higher quality brand,0
its a meh dress fabric is okay pretty color that wont fade i got the green but the very top of the dress has elastic that is too tight and makes your chest look awkward and unattractive not my favorite,0
not shaped correctly do not buy everything i wrong about this bra,0
the dress is absolutely perfect im a 36dd 54 185 and got a l love the material you can dress it up or just go shopping i would buy another for sure,2
slightly big for my head but makes it comfortable and not too tight,2
ok so im 53495 almost 53410 depending on what day it is i was excited for this due to the reviews about the garments stretchability i ordered a medium because most jumpsuits tend to have a gap at the back where it doesnt fit to my curves and i wanted a tight fit to hold me in it did fit tight but not to the point that i was uncomfortable the sleeves were short as well as the ankles as you can see i plan on adding sequin material to the wrists and ankles to accomodate for that that was no surprise its a very sexy outfit if it came in a 34tall version34 i like it ill only wear it once anyway but tall and curvy girls beware ill update my review after i make alterations and try it on again right now its a solid 3 due to the length,1
not bad quality but size m realy is large not like on picture 23 inch longer beware,1
im giving 2 stars because i love the band but it wasnt as advertised description said 22mm but i received a 38mm42mm indicated on the box the pins were too long for my samsung gear s3 im requesting a refund and will be returning the band,0
looks like a pair but its only one anklet,0
i just wish they had a better color selection socks are a little small but feel great,1
i love the color options for this bracelet i gave it to an essential oil enthusiast for christmas and they loved it they said the oil had lasted a work day in the office but was almost entirely gone by the time they got home i think if they had added a little more oil it would have stayed longer but she liked being able to switch it up each day i did have to remove the tassel almost immediately after giving it to her caught her new sweater twice and tagged it so definitely dont buy this product for the tassel its set in place by a thin cheap wire which bends easier than a paper clip it would easily fall off within the first few wears instead this bracelet for the beautiful color options,2
great item,2
size small 55 118 30f fits long which is expected very flattening though smashes your boobs to a near right angle and seams arent smooth they are actually itchy i wouldnt purchase again even though the material is smooth and the blackgray color is nice,1
i hope i can get another one in a different color,2
rekucci is becoming my go to brand for pants capris shorts these are no exception the white is not see through big plus and the fit is slimming but not constricting no worries about panty lines there is just enough stretch to make them very comfortable but does not end up baggy after a few hours of wearing love the pull on style with no zipper or button seems like too many of my shirts were developing holes in the front i assume from friction with the zipper or button i normally wear a size 8 and the size 8 were a perfect fit i am 5 434 and the shorts came to mid knee,2
i bought these for my now new sisterinlaw and her destination wedding to my brother she is very organized and my brother is a stickler for everything has its place that i knew these would be a win win for them my sil was extremely happy with this gift and i knew my brother would really appreciate the structured and strategic packing these cubes would allow in their luggage great buy great find affordable practical durable you wont be disappointed and it made my place as the best sister ever solidified again just saying,2
i was disappointed that this shirt did not fit as an xl should and that there were no larger sizes available i had to return and search for something else,1
i ordered small based on reviews and i am satisfied although i do have a longer torso in my opinion so i wish there was a little more fabric between waist to shoulders the fabric is a little thin but i would still wear out with spanks would buy again pics coming soon,2
well how do i start this is a for being a flexible shoe with steel toe its a 0 for being bullet proof my husband and his buddies shot the show while on his foot and yes he shot his foot not bullet proof and not made out of kevlar like the description says the bullet did go straight threw his foot so thankfully not major damage was done but lesson learned from this,1
its okay but i ended up buying a little wider set of 3 silicon bands and they looks a lot better good thing these bands are affordable,1
hits all the marks but runs small these are great not sheer no dramatic scoop back ugh hate that and the butt seams arent all gathered so no panty line i would suggest ordering just one size up because they run small nobody wants a metal snap cameltoe either,2
extremely comfortable so elegant and rich looking despite being super low priced perfect navy color i was looking for couldnt be more happy with them,2
feet slide in the shoe toes slide into the shoes tried different socks still loose and slipping around cant tighten the laces tight enough,1
these fit snuggly enough to not slip which i love not too tight either my only wish is that there was at least one solid included in the bunch,2
23 year size has a tag that said 10 i need this for today for my little niece who is 2 12br so disappointed,0
it was too small when i buy size 8 for my 6yr old at childrens place or any other place it fits perfectly i ordered a 8medium and it was more of a size 6 so i ordered a10 large and it fits a looser but still runs so much smaller,1
looks like plastic it is ok bought to go with dog dress i bought and they matched,1
i order a sm and my hips are 38 inches tried to fall of my hips at the end of the holes you cannot add holes to this belt too bad i got this for my skirts,1
these shows are so comfortable and light weight,2
this sweater wast 5 sizes to small,0
i was not generally impressed with the product it was small though it did said many and it just didnt seem like it could fit not only that it only had four pockets and i had to install a piece from previous wall that i am as well i guess it would work it seems like the the keychain piece is very good however the rest of it is a meh at best,1
these run a bit large and are kind of flimsy compared to a name brand sanuk also quite squeaky,0
ive had these for over a year now i use them for all kinds of things my favorite is taking them on tripsvacations i use one to carry on flights i can carry one of these with my purse inside as well as a few snacks and magazines i take the rest and then when im at my destination i have a different back to keep my dirty clothes in one to take for shopping purchases and the rest i use as small purses for nights out by tying a knot in them at the bottom the animal print one looks especially chic this way the straps are wide and comfortable the bags are super lightweight and small when rolled up if you dont have room in your case for them inside the convenient carrying pouch you can just take them individually they fit in crevices even inside shoes another great feature is theyre washable ive washed all of mine including the case many times and theyre holding up well note i dont put them in the dryer just let them air dry and they dry very quickly especially in the sun i cant think of a single con about this product one of the better purchases ive ever made,2
it was much to small,0
what is pictured above is not what i received it was supposed to be a zippered pouch and it is not im extremely upset as i was supposed fill them and give them as christmas gifts this week,0
fit that,2
not what i was hoping for too boxy and unflattering,1
almost shred putting them on very poor quality but fun paly cloths,0
these are the only shoes my great grandmother will wear she wears them out and always asks for the exact same pair for a replacement,2
havent worn them much but they feel like theyre sized about 1 size smaller than what i ordered theyre also very narrow,1
the mask was easily stretched and didnt go back to its original shape it ended up being too stretched out on the nose part of the mask for my kid i have 2 of the same masks already and no issues they are awesome,0
very soft smaller than expected shorter than expected but nice looking need to go up 2 sizes,1
always liked the ratchet belts but the grooves seemed to slip and loosen so far i can set it and forget it i even ordered two more,2
change the colors so fast,0
love the color scheme and patterns goes perfect with my different choice of colorful dress shirts love them,2
despite the picture you need to know that this is just the shirt not the gorilla head,0
i returned these they were itching and the size was not very clear and i ended up with the wrong size,0
i love them i just wish they were a little thicker,2
i like danskins long tops for exercise,2
fit perfectly thanks so much for the low cost high quality jacket,2
for church,1
34one size fit all34 that is wrong i am 6 feet tall 175 lbs and these things dont fit dont waste your money with these things unless your are a very small adult or a child plus they wont accept returns,0
garbage these slippers fit fine they keep your feet warm but the fur lining in them will start to come out and their will be barebald spots in the foot bed of the shoe i only wear these around the house and have had them for less than a year and they are falling apart i would never buy these again and could not recommend anyone else buy them also ugg will decline to help you out with shipping for warranty purposes on this item because you bought it from amazon and not ugg,0
they are okbut nothing special the length on me is not flattering so will keep thatbecause are black and i will use itbut will not order more material is nicefit is okjustnot impressed with this one,1
just received it in after a weeks time as to its lookswas okay the shinea few are scratch its qualitynot to sure if its real over allid say its good,1
very nice i lovey it,2
the sizing ran a little small these joggers are not like sweatpants or fleecelike at all they are almost shiny and dont breathe at all too big of a hassle at this time to send them back,0
i wanted something to wear on a daily basis this does not meet that need it is nice and large but way too heavy it also lacks quality mine came without the magnet that is used to keep the top cover the owl over the lens the chain is not meant for the weight it carries waste of money,1
it was fine for what i used it for but it was big and it just doesnt fit the way youd want it to especially around your wrists probably wont wear it again,0
not what i was expecting as belt is made of an elastic material it fits but would be better if it was not elastic as it is able to stretch quite a bit but seems to be of sturdy construction,1
the inside is very soft and i would have loved them but they run extremely small i wear a size 7 shoe and read all the reviews that say they run small so ordered a 758 and they are too small they should list in the description to size up or correct sizing returning for the next size up,1
all ive read for reviews has stated its unreliable i got this about 3 months ago ive had one week of it not pairing to my phone but since then it has worked fine one thing i will note is when you go to snooze or cancel an alarm on the shock clock itself it continues to zap which is frustrating and i have to rip it off my wrist in the morning if you do take the chance i recommend not using the jumping jack feature it does not work i will update as i continue to use this,1
bad quality dont buy it,0
these are beautiful beads the stones are bright and set well,2
great tool to have,2
only 3 stars because it is a huge shirt i did order a small i was thinking about a medium and thank goodness i didnt order the medium it is a nice soft cotton and is actually really comfortable its just huge would be great to use as a beach coverup not an every day shirt,1
these water shoes have a substantial sole yet are very light dry quickly perfect for water aerobics,2
cute shoes but had to return because they run small,1
its ok quality some parts are a bit weird,1
the shorts fit pretty true to size there is no give to the material order accordingly the material in the advertised picture looks soft the shorts i got were definitely not i did keep them as they fit well but i was disappointed in the material,1
thin,1
i got this gift for a friend for christmas and i was pleased to find that it looks more expensive than what i paid for it the quality is great and its a beautiful necklace,2
steel gray titanium light as a feather looks even better not worse as it gets wear the blue dial doesnt initially impress but it grows on you quicklyand at some point you begin to realize how beautiful it is together with the titanium and the solar movement ts about the total package it just looks the business has that tool watch aviation feel especially with the chronographbr br none of the usual citizen overcomplexitythe chronograph buttons work like they should like they do on a mechanical chronograph theyre always on and theyre always the chronograph 200m water resistance solid end links lots to absolutely love herebr br two things knock it down to four stars from five purely about price vs featuresbr br first its only a mineral crystal at this price it ought to be sapphire with sapphire you could wear it with confidence all the timewith mineral youre always afraid youll scratch it if you wear it in anything other than ideal circumstances second the lume is weak and barely lasts a couple of minutes why bother either do away with the lume entirely or make it brighter somehowbr br but overallyoud be hard pressed to come up with a cooler more beautiful watch,2
i dislike the pilling that occurred after just a few washings,1
i liked this dress it was just way too sheer and i couldnt find a pregnancy garment to go underneath so i returned it,1
levis have really gone down in quality over the past several years a poor quality fabric that is about half the weight of the 34good levis34 they also do not seem to fit as in the past and this pair shrunk horribly on the first wash until levis improves their quality ill be a fan of wrangler,0
love these shoes they wear just as i hoped,2
nice but the lens is very low quality plastic and scratches extremely easy,1
as a plus sized girl i buy a lot of batwing or dolman type blouses this one is not my favorite the fabric is uncomfortable rough doesnt breathe and it really does fit like a tent like you are trying to hide yourself which never works in your favor also the color is a lot more peach than i imagined which kind of makes me want to light it on fire usually i love what allegra k offers but i would stick to the more supple jersey knits if comfort means anything to you,1
it fits great looks great great price,2
too hard to squeeze,0
cute shirt i just have too much boob for it,1
love the color disappointed in the 34off the shoulder34 i got the impression that the dress was not really designed to be worn off the shoulder but an 34afterthought34 i also thought the dress had a distinctive waist band to allow the top half to flow freely cute dress not as excited to wear it now,1
i bought these because i have a pair of black bandolino pumps with a slightly shorter heel and they are my favorite dress shoes these are not nearly as comfortable i wish i could return them,1
to long,0
its a goto skirt stays put fits just right it could be a little longer but just pull it down a little more,2
good product looks more expensive,2
completely tarnished after one month dont bother,0
the photo is after 3 initial hours of wearing super easy to scuff and scratch the bottom of the boots are thin hard and hurt the front balls of my feet so i recommend padgel inserts they look nice but they cinch up in the ankle and are not as sleek as straight as in the photo so you get a slightlyoutdated look i recommend getting a half size larger than what you normally wear im keeping these but not 100 satisfied with them,1
the pattern is as pretty as it looks in the pictures the only thing i didnt like is that the material is not bendable it has a really hard lining underneath that makes the material not mild that well to the body looks stiff,1
one of the socks has a hole in the toe area after one day of use,0
love the plunging neckline but wish it were longer i will wear it with jeans but not leggings,2
does not look like pictures and time doesnt stay in screen,0
bigger than expected,1
love these glasses but broke quickly and customer service sucks,0
this is a cute leather bag to hold your phone and some credit cards or cash you can fit a key or fob but nothing bulky it has several slots to keep things organized and from falling out,2
my mom loves cats so when i saw this cat charm i had to get it for her i ended up giving it to her on mothers day and she loved it the only thing i didnt like about the charm was that its flimsy and wasnt sturdy besides that the charm is a great present for love ones,1
these run way too small like 2 sizes too small plus,0
my daughter has had these bracelets for about 1½ months and they are already starting to fall apart,1
i bought this skirt for a photo shoot and it was perfect made me feel super cute,2
way too small,0
son loves it,2
it is just a hair too wide to install ive read other reviews saying they got it to work but they just have had to really force it when i just spent hundreds of dollars on something im not comfortable forcing an aftermarket part onto it when it clearly doesnt have a proper fit,0
it was a gift for a friend and it was awesome and great,2
very pretty necklace bought as a gift for my sister who is a teacher and she loved it,2
i really want to love this necklace great cause and looks really cute the first issue is it is tiny i am a really small person and i am on the very last clasp i got the 13 inch so not sure if other sizes were available previously but if you are a medium to large person i do not think it would fit also it is very itchy and pulls the hairs on the back of my neck even when my hair its up i gave it 3 stars for the size and being uncomfortable i have had it about a week and no issues as far a how it is made i like the simple look of it was looking for a necklace i could wear everyday unfortunately that will not work for this one,1
the sizing is off on these,1
this is a cute comfortable dress the price was right and the color is nice a bit smaller that i expected but im sure ill wear it often,1
these are bigger than some of my adult masks they are certainly too big for a child who would be interested in daniel tiger,0
looks really nice holds enough for weekend trips has several pockets and an area big enough to hold my things it wheels easily so glad i bought this,2
dress is cute but way to short expect to wear it more as a shirt unless your child is short,1
i love the style the nosepiece and earpiece are very comfortable and sit nicely on my face the case is very nice too they claim to be scratch resistant but they scratch just as easily as any other sunglasses i scratched mine the first time i dropped them and the lens popped out also the polarization makes the inside of the lens blue which is kind of weird,2
these are really soft very similar to lularoe leggings however i was disappointed in the waistband the waistband on these is just cheap elastic which is uncomfortable and does nothing to help your figure i read other reviewers state that these sucked them in more than lularoe and i have to totally disagree these show all my buldges in an unflattering way as long as i wear a loose long top itll hide the flaws they were only 13 so i wont be returning them ill just wear them around the house,1
took a risk on this watch given the price its very light weight and does feel cheap but has been working well for a couple months today i just had the first problem the day of the week can no longer be changed it advances normally but its not catching when trying to adjust,0
fits all right but is cheap feeling and looking,1
they got wet i bought two one for me and one for my boyfriend and wont stay closed all the time but for the price theyre cute and were a cute anniversary gift we wear everyday had to get the photos resized via an etsy seller,2
poor quality for the price and not flattering,0
the headband is tiny and hardly fits on a childs head waste of money,0
okay so this is sooo cute and great quality im very happily surprised actually sometimes you dont know how you will like the material or the fit online but this is great its a soft material but not too thin like others you can tell its going to last just by touching it the colors are beautiful and it really is the prettiest of the tie dye patterns ive seen it has a v neck which is an extra bonus i dont like anything around my neck especially when sleeping so this is perfect it is as flattering as a nightgown can be and provides just enough coverage im super pleased with this,2
bought this as a gift for my lady out of state the shirt arrived with a hole in the collar the size of her pinky finger,0
nice material and designbr size descriptions need to be more accurate actual product received was larger than size indicated,2
wonderful dress the material was not too thick and fit very well i am 5734 140 pounds,2
i was excited about buying this wallet when i got it i was pleased with the look and size i also liked how it could carry everything i needed however it hasnt even been 6 months and already the inner seams have fallen apart exposing the cards and making it very difficult to pull my cards in and out i do not heavily use the product or try to force the cards in each slot so its not like im abusing this thing my folding 20 wallet is 8 years old and has no torn seams disappointed in the quality,0
this collar got nonstop comments every time i wore it over the holidays looks great under sweaters the material is silky feeling and feels high quality,2
nada delicados y bien mal hechos no los devuelvo porque los envié a otro país y allí fue que los pude ver,0
soft at first but gets that scratchy feeling after a few weeks i would not buy this again,0
this isnt a bad shirt it fits well and fabric is soft and breathable i really like it save for the fact i now look like a brand new traffic cone this is a very bright orange im a walking highlighter i dont need a reflective belt for running on base other than that not bad at all,1
my grandchildren loved it because of the covid they couldnt go see santa so i brought santa to them my husband was perfect,2
although my daughter did love most the pieces some of them broke before even getting on her just trying to put the earrings on her they snapped in half the necklace wand headband and crown have held up well as has the gloves but the rigg big and earrings both broke,1
the earrings look beautiful on the silver mother of pearl are really shiny the wire is super flimsy got all bent up just putting rubber backs on,2
vivitulip womens short sleeve t shirts summer crew neck tops casual loose tees with pocketbr br this shirt runs a size or two small as some other reviewers have mentioned im normally a small or medium im 57 135 lbs between an a and b cup i went with a large and it fits tight across the chest and the shoulders the scoop neck is very high cut i like the blue color and the front pocket but the fit is definitely off,2
nice color but quality is not great i will keep it because you get what you pay for,1
this is definitely a boxy tee its also a little sheer and thin im not sure why the price point is so high for this i understand that its designer but the quality isnt there to match i am pretty sure my pearshaped ring could tear a whole through this if i moved the wrong way,2
i think its the worst nothing like the picture please people dont buy fabric like what an umbrella is made of print washed out looking dont buy its like a top not a dress didnt want to put a star i had to in order to send my review,0
a few were broken not boxed good,1
got this for my 14 year old son for christmas almost a year ago he would probably give it four stars but mostly because he just likes anything electronic and isnt too worried about details three things with this watch first the temp is not accurate unless you take the watch off otherwise it is measuring your temp not the outside temp second i got the watch a year ago today and my son brought it downstairs and it had quit i dont know if it is the battery or the thing just bricked but it is under warranty for two years so we are going to send it back to be fixed or replaced third the altimeter is a joke we did some hiking on the at where we knew pretty precise elevations based on the maps we were using it is at times hundreds of feet off my son doesnt know whether or not the barometer is accurate and is uncertain about the compass but thinks the compass is also off it is a good watch for fun and looks good but the abc in this watch are not convincing one thing i can tell you i would not rely on this watch in any sort of situation where i actually needed the ab or c it does tell time pretty well and the stopwatch works well br br update the repair company fixed it and sent it back two days later it quit again we sent it back a second time received the watch in the mail about a month later but one day later the watch stopped working again sent it back again and just requested a refund originally i had given this three stars but have downgraded it to one star customer service gets five stars though asurion was responsive and speedy although im not sure why their watch tech squad didnt just send us a new watch to begin with in any case the refund is fine well use it to buy another watch but obviously not this watch,0
really like the shirt and while it is thin it is not too thin the quality seems good as well my problem with this shirt is the size most large shirts are for size 12 some are 1012 or 1214 this shirt was clearly smaller than the average large im almost convinced that the wrong label was placed on the shirt this shirt definitely runs small and you will want to go up at least one size to find a normal fit,1
cute packaging they look and feel great,2
top was oddly shaped loose on top and tight on bottom i am thin and was not expecting this fit wore once and threw it out,0
im normally an 85 and bought an 85 i have a narrow heel toe box fits comfortably inside sole is cushy but the back was a bit large for my narrow heel but because of the strap it doesnt fly off my foot,1
i am very happy with the quality of these earrings they are quite lovely the heart design with old fashioned keyhole in the center is timeless ssssh i originally ordered these to give my daughter but i liked them so much that i have kept them for myself,2
read a few reviews that said the ring scratched because their husbands worked with their hands i thought this wouldnt be an issue because my husband does not two days after wearing it he had 2 wide scratches on it the black was scraped off and the shiny bottom layer is showing deffeinatly not tungsten bought this because he lost his 500 tungsten ring giving it 3 stars for its price and becausedespite the scratches my husband still loves it,1
this is an excellent and beautiful watch i recommend it for everyone who likes a watch with excellent presence,2
the first 2 items i ordered from pretty make were perfect i decided to order 2 more in different colors same size big mistake first 2 black navy by great feeling were wonderful second order burgundy brown by bebo fit like a small even though both tags on garments read size xxlxxxl very disappointed contacted seller 2 weeks ago through amazonstill no response,0
this brand is hit and miss you either get a winner or a loser this one is a loser,1
beautiful but the chain at the end of the wings looked bad it kind of reminded me of a little girlsomething bracelet for a vending machine the only thing that that looked good was the wings and the pearl,1
i got my first enchroma lenses in 2015 and happily wore them for a few years they were great super helpful for colors and looked like normal graytinted lenses like the website shows now in 2018 i ordered replacement lenses and when i received them theyre purplepinkish tinted what theyre totally different dont work as well for me and look ridiculous the website doesnt have any indication that the lenses are tinted this odd color wish theyd return to the old lenses or at least give you the option giving 3 stars because the old gray lenses were 5 stars for me but purplepink lenses are 1 star,1
dont recommend because the sizes are way off and the materiel is very poor quality,1
i like it because it hold all the cards i need but it is very difficult to get the cards out of the slots i am hoping it will loosen up the longer i use it i just started to use it a few days agobr i like the color and the change purse area,1
nice shirt,1
not quite what i wanted,0
i had to get this to be a groomsman in an old friends wedding its not the worst time ive ever worn it served its purpose not sure ill ever wear it again but maybe its really heavy material forget about doing any exotic knots unless youve got more skill than i not that i have a very much failed to get it into an acceptable trinity knot a knot im fairly comfortable constructing,1
great,2
nice quality just a lil wider than i expected,1
i love keds as they are a good value these not so muchbr br great color cute design but there is little to no padding if i had known i would not have bought them,0
the size information given was incorrect the belt was 3 inches shorter than advertised,0
using for everyday casual wear look and feel great,2
the fabric of these onesies is very comfortable and the quality of the colors are great nice and vibrant,2
was an ok dress the material is a little heavy and its rather plain would really need to accessorize it cant just wear it by itself rather stretchy material gave it two stars because it had a strong smell,0
i love this with my tights and a jacket soft and comfy,2
daughter loves this dress,2
husband liked the wallet but it took forever to arrive,1
gorgious dress beautiful fit,2
seam and lining damaged dark spots on brim fits very well,1
everything,0
the picture looks way better than the actual blouse looks very mediterranean in person the blouse runs small the fabric was uncomfortable,0
terrible photo is not the same sweatshirt such a disappointment,0
shrank to the point of being unwearable after one wash washed in cold dryer on mediumbr br wouldnt recommend,0
omg this shirt is so soft color is beautiful the fit is good not miniature asian sizing im 50 140 lbs and an xl is loose and comfy def worth the money and perfect for life in florida and my fave past time the beach,2
too short waisted forget it if you are tall ok fit if you are average flight also had the most craptastic experiencebr at ups trying to get the label to printhad to pay to send it back arrghbr,0
this is a nice weight sweater with deep color i wear it in buildings with ac works well in the spring summer and fall in the northeast us i have a red a deep navy blue a black and a white sizing is accurate,2
small but cute,2
cheap cheap cheap,0
gift for grandkids who are tiger and lions and wings fans they loved it,2
it was perfect,2
button was missing,1
very comfortable and well made looks nice too,2
the headline gives the tldr version but let me jump into some of the details out of the box these slippers have a nice appearance and seem solidly constructed they do look narrow and i wasnt sure they would fit me but after putting them on they stretched out comfortably and do not feel at all tight or constricted one of my ankles tends to swell up a lot and it took some effort to get the slipper on but it was fine once i had it on the other slipper went on normally on the nonswollen ankle at first the top of the slipper around both ankles rubbed a bit against my skin but by the second day i didnt notice that anymorebr br they do not feel warmer than other shoes or slippers to me and they clomp on the floor more loudly when i walk than any other shoes or slippers i own the term clodhopper very much comes to mind when i am walking around in them the noise doesnt bother me though your mileage may vary at 350 lbs im a big guy and my weight presses down hard enough on the slippers that i can feel the treads on the bottom right through the memory foam again that doesnt bother me at all but again your mileage may vary the actual rating id give these slippers is 35 stars since i cant do that and since i am writing this during the holiday season ill be nice and give them the extra half a star,2
disappointed that there are no lower pockets only the breast pocket also not thrilled about the look of the denim it has a worn look with gouges in the fabric,0
i only wore the item twice the first time was perfect after i washed it it shrunk,1
its not the best quality,1
the shoe has nice breathable design in the front very soft nice color which would go with a lot of things and would be a nice pair of shoes for summer if it wasnt a total disaster in the heel area of this shoe it has no solid structure but just a rubber band in the back which cuts into the skin shoe somewhat bigger then expected size and looks really funny with some empty space in the back and i felt like my foot was sliding forward which made this issue with the back strap even worse,1
it is so cheap polyester thattvi am embarrassed to put it on it was trashed already,0
very comfy and quality is great they fit as expected and style is exactly as shown in picture i got for a costume idea however will probably wear them again,2
great shoes well made old favorite,2
we love our babiators my son wears them and they fit him at six months great his head is on the smaller side for his age he doesnt squint outside anymore color was right on we got two green and blue,2
nice look but flimsy material and too small too short would fit a small person better,1
construction,0
i am a new balance fan all my walking shoes are nb and ive always word 85 b or d so was very surprised when i couldnt even get this one on my foot i believe it is missized,0
i really like this band for the blaze its well made and looks good besides it was easy to take out the needed segments to adjust the size they made it easy with the included tools ive had similar watch bands in the past and didnt have the tools and struggledbr i would definitely buy this again,2
my wife has very sensitive skin and we use these to provide shade when we are out for extended periods of time works good and looks very pretty,2
the top is just a bit too small so i had to take out the pads,2
fit my daughter perfectly stylish compression socks for her recovery,2
im very satisfied with this product its nice looking well made and inexpensive,2
oh so fake looking,0
looks good and not cheap looking would buy again,2
tiny broken when arrived,0
fun fashion necklace,2
very nice but very short,1
swimming and sun protection,2
i did not like them,0
very high quality very happy,2
not bad considering the price but originals if you want original quality thoughbr br look identical to oakley lenses from the outside but they are not as clear and there is definitely more glare looking outwards i do like the bronze base color better than my original oakley lenses gray base,1
what is this likebr this dress is more like an oversized shirt the denim is thin and it is black in color more like chambray than denimbr br designbr this is kind of a shapeless design it is not that flatteringbr br fitbr i wear a size 14 16 misses us at the time of this evaluation and this fit me well and can be buttoned if i like i dont think this would work as a dress it is not flattering to be passed off as a dressbr br comfortbr this is a relaxing jacket i dont feel special when wearing it i throw it on when i want to have something a little warmer on but that is about it i also use it for yard workbr br the bottom linebr this dress is more of an over jacket for me it is not very flattering but it is great for yard work or times when i just want to relax and throw a denim overshirt onbr br my ratingbr four stars this is okay but not wow i wear it but i probably would not buy it again,2
very comfortable and super cute,2
comfy soft and has pockets can be dressed up or dressed downi love it,2
like the suit but it runs big,1
items made a cheap material looks very cheap would never wear this item ever if i could give it a zero as a rating i would,0
updatebr the previous review applies however the material is less see throughbr br i ordered a size down i normally wear a size large but got a medium and could have very easily worn a smallbr br worn with httpssmileamazoncomgpproductb0149x7c0orefppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00ieutf8psc1 not availablebr br previous reviewbr see through very very light weight material you will see every jiggle and roll the color was pretty the length was good,2
returned they are too big the weight of them makes them turn and look ridiculous so sad because they are gorgeous wish they made smaller ones,0
first the pack is good in quality but it was too small and ridged for my purposes but because of its 34petite34 size my 23 yearold daughter latched on to it to use during our family vacation at the beach it was great for her small makeup items and her id i tried to fit my iphone 6 with a flip open case into the pack i could shove it in but getting it out to answer a call was a big challenge also the cellphone crowded out other necessities my answer was to go to a larger everest product i used that during a recent trip to juneau alaska and it was perfect,0
a little thin for cashmere but its worth the price if you live in florida and wear a sweater twice a year,1
i ordered the purple and pink silicone key ring and only received the purple one this is not okay i paid for 2 and only received one,0
i keep it with me everyday as a reminder of loss hope and spirituality,2
its a cute dress but too short on the sleeves and dress length not meant for tall women,0
these are all just lovely the material is soft and flows nicely beautifully made i am a plus size woman and there is plenty of material to cover i know i will enjoy the several that i purchased i am very picky about my clothing and i am more than satisfied with this companys product i bought the button up ones as well as the open front ones the button ups are see through just perfect with a tank top underneath the sleeved ones lay so nicely with a tank top also sleeved ones are not see through,2
more like a childs size lg,1
its okaya plain band good fit,1
this is how these socks look like after one day of use never seen such a level of poor quality in baby socks dont get influenced by the positive reviews,0
wonderfully designed piece,2
was small like a child size the purse quality is poor flimsy and very cheapx,0
too ill right now to mail back for credit though approved,1
pretty dress but the waist is much higher than pictured material is very thin not very excited about it,0
nice hat,2
great pageant shoe,2
i ordered two necklaces in the same transaction to give as gifts product is as shown but i was not thrilled about getting two significantly different sized necklaces the larger of the two necklaces had flaws in the metal on the backside of the mountain the smaller one i got was perfect and exactly what i was looking for,1
muy pequeña,0
i am such a huge soprano fan was so excited to get this shirt as the one i had got ruined love it but wish they had a large,2
fits like a tight large and barely long enough to meet the waist i wear everything in xl this is not an xl,0
they were such a great value,2
i liked the color the most but the size could have been slightly larger liked it overall,2
note i attempted to return this product as i ordered it during a free prime shipping and free returns promotion and when i attempted the return i got the message 34this item isnt eligible for returns34 i contacted amazon and waiting for a responsebr br prosbr quality of workmanship is good for the pricebr faux fur is of good quality not the best but decentbr br consbr the cuff is too small to fit over the top of my tall bootsbr the knit fabric is too loosebr br here are the dimensionsbr fur cuff 3534 high 634 across making it approx1234 total circumference its tight on the part of my leg right below the knee and i have small legsbr br knit fabric approx 4534 below the bottom border of the fur its loose,1
terrible quality length adertised includes the inch that is riveted around buckle usable length is 1534,0
not bad obviously shoes fit differently on different people ive always worn this brand and this shoe is a bit narrower than the other ones ive worn year after year,1
runs small and short not what i was expecting,0
material is not great,0
no,0
awful cheap material its not sweatshirt material its cut you short if you know what i mean,0
warm for winter comfortable for men to wear,2
not the right size,1
great for nurses,2
i dont like the size chart i chose a bigger size and its still small,0
my nearly 9 yo son wears a size 12 in boys clothes thats his size 12 undies under the swimsuit since these are supposed to be mens i ordered the 24 which is for 27 waist as you can see in the pictures his undies are 12 and the suit is 95 now i know these are supposed to stretch but a full 8s they didnt im going to update this post when i get the next pair which will be size 28,1
comfy and warm,2
its cute enough but kind of long for me im short 54 pockets are fine,1
my 3 years old son super love this product he look so good in it it completes his outfit everytime fast shipping will order again in different color,2
these are far thinner and more flimsy than the photograph makes them look very disappointing,0
i bought an extra large as im typically a large or extra large in most shirts this one is clearly designed to be a bit baggy but the extra large was huge its a nice comfy shirt and will be perfect for a day out running errands a trip to the movies or just hanging out at home no real complaints about it,1
i wear medium size and what i received is marked m but it is more of a small,1
it runs to big and its not like the shirt that i ordered its short and wide,0
love the look of these laces my only complaint is the outer layer bunches up when try to remove to clean my boots if you never remove the laces they will be great i probably wont buy again,1
i really liked these until all of the balls started unscrewing and getting lost i have very sensitive ears but these did not hurt my ears so i was very excited about them i check my earrings multiple times a day and now have lost 4 of the screw on backs,1
but these were a bit tight in the hips,1
these are great as everyday leggings but they attract dog hair really badly and are not workout quality,1
was very thin material a bit too thin for me so i gave it to my daughter and she loves it,1
this is way too small i ordered an xl and this didnt even fit my 12 year old granddaughter who normally wears an xs to small,0
the size fits as expected so dont listen to anyone review if it doesnt fit you it means that you wear different sizebr the only thing that i didnt like is the materialvery cheap and poorly made,1
light weight not like pic,1
the pattern is cute the fit was not no support for my large chest returned,0
looks great,2
bad quality,0
i ordered my normal size according to the chart its about 2 sizes too small ill be returning,0
they say not hot bull on my neck instance hot not that breathable my old one my son gave me for dust is much better,0
this is a very basic cami it is comfortable and true to color and size nothing special about it and the neckline is a tad higher than i expected its a nice top for lounging around in,1
perfect for business or leisure heavy cotton is great for cool spring or fall wear boat neck is flattering for all figures,2
this is way too small for a xl it doesnt even cover my whole butt it fits more like a medium,0
cute but they run small i usually wear a large but i got an xl to be safe they are still a bit small,1
just not a very good or comfortable,0
purchased a size larger figuring i could take it in it was two sizes too small fabric weight ok but kind of cheap looking,0
fits a little small,2
very pretty and dainty necklace however it arrived with a broken latch not wearable due to damaged closing latch disappointing to say the least,0
only wore once so far but feel good have thin soft lining and are lightweight will revise review later after wearing longer if need be so far these are fine,2
this is a super cute romper and seems to be well made i ended up having to sew the chest portion up a bit though as it was way too revealing of my ds lol a smallerbr chested woman may not have this problem,2
i bought this for my boyfriend and i i have the all black with one blue bead i wore it outside for about 5 hours while shopping and the sun ruined the blue bead to the point of it almost being white after only a few hours outside my bracelet no longer matches my boyfriend i wouldnt have worn it outside if i knew it would fade so much after just one day,0
im a true size 10 and these were way to small however there were very pretty but had to return,0
unable to wear not true to size,0
shinier than i expected and too big for my small wrist gave it to my sister in law and she likes it,1
between the size style and fabric it just isnt the skirt for me i have a fairly large backside and this was quite formfitting in that area it made my butt look nice from far away but due to the nature of the thin stretchy fabric up close there were obvious panty lines and you could see my cellulite it was a great color and if i had a bangin body i would keep up but i need a fabric and style that is a bit more forgiving i will be returning this one,0
i really like this purse its beautiful,2
doesnt look like picture returned,0
im 53 and it was too short in the torso so it crept in all the wrong places,0
love the dress fit as expected,2
the design was completely uneven too far to the right and the color certainly does not match the color in the picture i ordered navy which also looks like royal blue in the sellers pic,0
exciting ring my husband will enjoy,2
looks beautiful in pictures but made cheap honestly not even worth the price,0
beautiful watch,2
these bras were well made and look like theyd be comfortable for smaller breasted women you cant order a cup size and i found the bras much too small for me to wear,0
was great at first after a week or so the liquid leaked out wish it lasted longer,1
very flimsy ring caught it on a blanket and it bent way out of shape,0
kinda ok a bit stiff and dorky looking i have short hair so probably best for people with longer hair,1
the mask wasnt sewn together and ties came out of mask when i opened the package,0
the fit of the shirt is great however its cut short wish it wasva little longer cuz its such a nice shirt,1
update after wearing the dress the first time i noticed imperfections in the fabric thin lines like runners in pantyhose material i was afraid it would snag and spread so i opted to return the dress such a shamebr br for reference im normally a size 14 pear shaped 383446 the xl fits me perfectly keep in mind this dress is a polyester spandex blend so while it does stretch alot it also hugs and will not hide imperfections so if youve got some rolls or dimples you want to hide youll want to wear a slip or shapewear with this dress i love that this dress stretches so well i dont even have to bother with the zipper just pull it over my head now if i wanted a form fitted look i probably could have sized down to a large without busting out of the dress but because im not a tiny girl i opted for the xl comfortable fit the chest and armholes arent too snug and the length is a couple inches below the knee on me im 5 foot tall i would buy this dress in other prints the color of the navy with white flowers that i got is just as expected from the picture the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the quality of material doesnt seem like it will hold up well to washing or last long and the material also will tend to get warm not breathe well,1
wasnt pleased didnt look like the pics looked faded and possibly used had lint balls on it and looked stretched out,0
they worked fine for a durango ski trip requires a liner on really cold days,1
i know i paid under 2 for this but this thing is rubbishbr i live in fl so its hot and humid sweating is unfortunately normal that being said this chain started irritating my neck within just a few minutesyes yes i know its not real silver irritation continued so i took it off after maybe two hoursbr the attached photos show how rusty it was extremely disappointed and kinda expected,0
these ties are wonderful they look professional and the quality is good,2
i like the style the polish so decided to keep itbr surprisingly they dint come with any certificate and the packaging was like for a 10 earringi hope the polish stays,1
i love this tank top fits just right,2
a gift for my wife they are great for walking on an east coast winter day,2
didnt realize it was going to be hard casingbut that ok,2
these tanks are super cute and i love the light weight material colors are also very bright i purchased the bkblpnk i was very tempted to keep them however i really need tanks with some shape control these tanks have no compression at all i even purchased a smaller sizebr br if you are looking for a nice silky feeling tank you will not go wrong with these,1
this is an attractive dress it is very pretty it seems like it is nice quality i like that it is comfortable but that you can wear it to work it seems very stylish it has a nice shape the fabric is soft and feels very well made basic black is good for work i think you can wear it for going out too it is pretty versatile we have many items from this brand and have been pleased with the quality and durability i would recommend it,2
very nice purse and has what i like in a purse nice quality great size and plenty of compartments great value for the money,2
excelente producto como lo esperaba,2
nice necklace and charm however very fragile chain broke after 2 weeks of wearing it,1
i ordered this because there are times that i dont have pockets but i still want quick access to my phone the pouch holds my iphone x easily i will still keep this in my carbigger bag for this purpose but i dont think id use it as a primary wallet because the gap where it closes there is so large im afraid i might lose cash or cardsbr br the red color is nice and the tassels are cute,1
so ugly the buttons are flashy and too much the shape is no my flattering at all immediately returned,0
much larger than expected but still very pretty i put charm on my own 1834 sterling silver chain and like the shorter length much better chain is cheap quality but moon charm is quite beautiful and sparkling,1
bought as a gift and it was perfect,2
love,2
as i explained i ordered a large size but i think it is a little too big i dont think people with small feet need to order something big,0
loved the bag perfect size to have laptop as well as many other things,2
the skirt is great looks good with a denim jacket,2
its big on my small 6 year old but he absolutely loves it regardlessbr nice material has held up,2
use it every time i travel and for weighing boxes sent by mail accurate and easy to use,2
it keep braking,1
looks much larger in picture than actually is lovely stones and shape but the earnings look like they are fot a child i was so disappointed i would only recommend these earrings for little girls,0
i bought the larger size for my nine months old who is not walking yet this pair is very big for him but keeps his feet away from wind and cold air i am happy with it,2
i love the necklace only 3 stars because it discolored,1
looks bad and has no support,0
the colors are vibrant,2
dress comes much shorter than it looks,1
these dust bags are good quality and breathable so they work for my purses but i was disappointed in the size the pictured bags are misleading there is no way a backpack could fit into the largest bag they work for some of my other bags but not for the ones i actually bought for,1
i ordered a small and its like a tent on me im 56 and 120lbs wayyy too big,0
these sandals are really cute i am happy with them love the color,2
love this but one part broke off quickly,1
i love how they fit they are very comfortable i just wish they would be better made i purchased these in 816 and it is now 217 and the seems are giving away they are loose fitting so i dont understand why the seems are coming apart very disappointing,0
thank you very much very nice item great shipping speed,2
just a bit big,2
this is a sweet little gift to inspire someone makes a great any occasion gift it is flimsy due to the coated string so i dont think it would last long if worn on a daily basis but it is easy to wear and lightweightbr br the sentiment is lovely,2
i gave 3 stars because the charm is gorgeous however the way it is put together the solitaire part does not play flat it lays sideways i tried putting the chain differently on the bale still twists i tried a longer chain still twists i own a lot of merthus jewelry i am rarely disappointed maybe it was just the one i received i am sad the charm is just gorgeous,1
way too small i returned it,0
this hat is the cutest most comfortable and stylish beanie with the cutest pompom and i love the story behind it i would highly recommend the fabric is super soft and not itchy like some beanies,2
fit is very tight not well made poor quality,0
i ordered the adult large received it today and it would maybe fit a 10 year oldmaybe i am just over 6 ft tall and the legs come down to my knees the sleeves are super short too about elbow length the body portion would fit someone a little under 6 ft tall unless you are under 6 ft tall with miniature arms and legs avoid this purchase,0
runs small ones i ordered initially were extremely tight great colors,2
beautiful piece but it broke as soon as i pulled it out of the package i managed to glue it back together but the fact is broke so easily is not a good thing at all,1
after the multiple negative review i choose not to go through with this product review one perk i wanted was the pockets,1
would not stay connected to my fitbit i could just tug a little and it comes undonefitbit cost too much to lose over a cheap band wouldnt recommend,0
was a little tight,2
this jacket might be my sons new favorite its a nice slim fit and lightweight material the fabric is soft and it fits well the color is a nice light gray that hides dirt better than white but without being too dark the contrast stitching is a nice touch,2
it was to small for me so i had to return it,2
cute dress however the hoodneckline was not as shown there was less fur that made it look cheapybr i was able to add some fur to better resemble the picture so i was happybr im 58 and the dress hit right above my kneesbr im a size 810 true hourglass shape the medium fit well and had plenty of room to let out to be a true 10 possibly 12br cute festive dress id purchase again,2
i will probably not wear these as they are not well made and look so cheap not expensive so i just kept them rather than return them three in a drawer for disposal later,1
this dress looks great on me however i am disappointed that its so thin people can basically see my legs through the clothes and that really made me uncomfortable when i wore it yesterday yes the dress fit me well but it was pointless because of the material,1
i can deal with the 34you get what you pay for34 when it comes to quality etc but they falsely advertised a color i bought this thinking it was burgundy it lists the color as burgundy and its displayed on the picture as burgundy meanwhile the dress i got was red not a dark red bright luckily i bought a backup but i shouldnt have to go thru the trouble of ordering and now returning bc they falsely advertised the color i wouldnt have ordered had i known this was the 34burgundy34,0
these pants are not high waisted or true to size i wear a size 14 usually and a size 16 fit like a 13,0
color is more blue than green i wanted a green one,1
omg i am appalled these earrings came looking so old n dirty nothing like the picture i understand 34sterling silver oxidizes34 but you didnt even polish them how embarrassing it was giving these to my granddaughter at her birthday party in front of many people you didnt even care see pictures below never again first impressions last forever,0
hard to put in hard to take out,0
i have been trying to make the change from opaque storage to all see through containers i find that i dont use containers as much when i can not see through them but if i have transparent containers i can find what i need more quickly lets take a look at this bagbr br what is this likebr this bag comes in a flat container when opened up this bag is cubic in nature it is like a box the bag is not only see through but it is completely bound in holographic binding and handles the zipper is metal and is double ended so you can open as small as you want tobr br how does this performbr i love to put my knitting prrojects in here i can keep all of the yarn and the instructions for at least two projects depending on how big they are i can also use the top of the bag partially open between the zippers to feed yarn through when knittingbr br bindingbr the binding on this is in the perfect places it covers sides ends and corners keeping them from cracking and getting holes in the plastic so quicklybr br the bottom linebr this is a great bag i love it for yarn and knitting projects and love the double ended zipper the handles are perfect and holographic trim is absolutely beautiful i love this thingbr br my ratingbr five stars this is the perfect bag for me i really love this and am glad to have it i would easily consider buying more in the future,2
awesome i got to go with a costume these are really nice perfect fit cute,2
doesnt fit too small,0
this is my 2nd wallettriflowits been a long time wallet the one i just got is the walletjust newthe last one just lost the looks of my new onebest ever ownedbut it you will be surprised by this walletat least for me66 years oldthanks my honest reviewno holes barredbobby,2
ive been eyeing these for a while finally bought them in black size 8 12w they came in a steve madden box so im not sure about the knockoff issue but do have my concerns that they may bebr the length width fit fine almost a tad big in bare feet however there is absolutely no support on the footbed at all i have a bad back plantar fasciitis balance issues and i need good support so now on top of the purchase price i must by some kind of gel foam inserts in order to wear them comfortablybr i wear a lot of shoes well known for good foot support alignment am used to a comfortable supportive shoe i bought these for the style thought being from steve madden that there would be some sort of support maybe thats part of the reason for the knockoff issuebr love the style but hate the lack of support its like walking on concrete thus the low star rating they were sent back within 2 days now i guess ill look in the high end department stores or the steve madden shoppes for the shoe and see if the foot bed has any cushioning may cost more but if i get the comfort support i need it will be worth it its a shame these have been so bad for so many customers,0
the sweater its baggysqueary and lose the fabric is fine the color its not accuerate i bought the green one in the pics look like a nice green but it turns out to be a really deep green so know i own a baggy sweatear that looks like a bad style grandma sweater i wont recomend this product,1
i bought these light weight capris for an upcoming plane trip in a size medium normally i take a size 8 although they fit okay in the hips and legs the waist was very large from the picture it looks like these pants sit slightly below the waist which i prefer but while the back hit where it should the front was 45 inches below my navel very strange cut,1
very comfortable but wrinkles and rides up the legs that was a deal breaker for me so i returned them,1
does not hold very long,0
thicker than i expected this could wear well on its own the only thing to know is that its not a terribly flexible chain it has a little bit of a stiffness to it so it might take a little bit more space to store,2
i love these shirts shirts are lightweight great material and fits as indicated i use it for gym workouts and for outdoor running highly recommended,2
washed very carefully with premium products prior to trying on material was too rough havent been able to wear,1
my wife has been wearing for 7 years now without a single problem amazing watch and longevity next watch will be one of these if i ever have to buy her another,2
fade quickly,1
pay close attention to the size chart and measure yourself before you purchase im normally a 1x or 2x but in this jacket i had to get the xxxl if you need an easy jacket to wear with jeans or a skirt this will be fine,1
if it were possible i would give this zero stars its absolute garbage i seriously doubt its even real silver it arrived in a sealed box marked new i opened it and the pendant is completely grey and tarnished i tried to clean it with my silver cloth and it is not something that will rub off its the actual color of the metal its made out of i cant believe that they sent me this trash and have the nerve to charge 2800 for it shame on you this is definitely going back,0
it was good for a few months but i guess my habit of filling it with fat stacks of cash stretched it out so much that it no longer effectively retains cards really heckin annoying firstworldproblems,0
perfect gift,2
the bracelet was gaudy and the charms too small,0
does not lay as good as pictures,1
the loops are small and not made for people with big noses,0
these are very nice gloves for the money the fit was as i expected and i like that they included loops to help remove them they have definitely made my cycling experience more pleasant recommended,2
i love these this is my 2nd pair of the liverpool leggings and they are great stretchy and comfortable and look great,2
i have yet to try the dress on my daughter but im already not that happy first of all i had to send the first dress back because it wasnt as described it doesnt fit small and its not short my daughter is 57 and 120 lbs the medium was down to her knees and too big i sent it back and just received the small pulled it out of the bag and its coming apart at the seam she needs it for a function so its too late to send back,0
terrible quality and there are two straps that dont connect the fringe isnt even separated just clumps that need to be cut,0
they are just what i needed for work,2
i originally had a 5 star review as this dress is super cute and flattering but after washing cold delicate and in a garment bag and hung to dry it shrunk at least 2 sizes unfortunately am returning,0
pros soft and cozy on the inside wideband waist is comfortable lots of colors in the 7packbr cons awful chemical smell out of the package that hasnt completely gone away after washing outside of the leggings has a sheen that makes them look cheap baggy at the ankles some of the pairs have one leg longer than the otherbr bottom line these are fine for around the house or maybe to wear underneath skiwear or as a base layer for cold weather outings hopefully the smell will go away with more washes,0
bothers my eyes if i wear too long,0
just got it last night my gf loves it,2
wonderful quality and super cute however if you have bigger thighs be warned the stocking might fit too snugly but they get the job done one of the best quality materials for a cosplay ive bought before,2
perfect and half the price of other bags like it only issue is make sure the screws stay tight because the straps will not stay if they are loose replacements are sold though,2
runs large nice fabric and made well nice to be able to adjust buttons at shoulders im 51 170 and it hit me mid calf,2
these little boots are more fancy socks than boots they do run a tiny bit large which i appreciate as the mother of a fat baby theyre pretty cute and theyre very soft and very warm,2
daughter likes,2
well made cap except the button is faulty and does not stay snapped otherwise decent quality for the price,1
dont really like the shoe probably should have returned it way to large next size down would be too short i have put insert in them but they are just too wide,0
cabochon set is too small for base and is very visible on one side very cheap looking they want me to send a picture of it i dont have access but whomever inspected it before shipment did a bad job,0
mask came in without battery pack company replaced mask with quickly looks great,2
very thin i ended up running through mud and theyve become permanently discolored no amount of washing or oxyclean could get them back to normal kinda pricey for something i only got to wear once,1
i love the sturdiness of these shoes however if you are flat footed they will cause pain after wearing them about two weeks my feet strated hurting terribly i tried all kinds of insoles and nothing was helping have to switch shoes now,1
fun glasses that go with just about anything youll wear i really like the champagne colored ones theyre different from all my other sunglasses and i look forward to wearing them there is a decorative v on each side giving them a designer look these are made really well feel sturdy and look good on they come with a dust bag and a cleaning cloth i checked and they dont appear to be polarized all in all these are gonna be my travel go to glasses,2
ok,2
these were okay good for price they were very thin and absolutely no lining would be good for sleepwear,1
excelente producto y rápido envío,2
very nice hat but i returned this one because the front top where the logo are did not lone up with the bill it was off center and looked stupid,1
too small on top to big on the bottom,0
these shoes are horrible my son has worn them for about six weeks and they look awful they didnt make it one week before they started to break down im too embarrassed to send my son to school in his new school shoes ill have to throw these in the garbage and buy a different pair of shoes im very disappointed,0
cute little dresses for my 2year old quality is alright for the price they are a little thin but are perfect for playing around the house fabric is cotton washed them still looking good,2
the 5oaks waterproof rain pants are very nice they are lightweight and easily fit over pants the size medium fit me perfect and i am a size 32br br the length of the pants is just right below the ankle without too much extrabr br there are two zipped pockets at the waist on each side and one zipped pocket at the thigh the material is a lightweight waterproof polyester and a thin mesh material on the inside the waistline features an elastic pullon with drawstring and stopperbr br overall these are a great seat of rain pants that have worked well and kept the water out,2
the hat arrived on time its warm and cute,2
cut me weird and tight across the chest but very large in the body torso area also has very weird neck piping that stands straight up i was hoping it would be higher quality ill wear it to bednowhere else though,1
i dont like the fact that around the thigh area seem to too small i believe it is a manufacturing issue with perhaps this set particularly other than that great product,1
cheaply made the collar and front is a raw edge the bottom and sleeves are finished seams i do not expect this item to last long but it is nice and thin and stretchy buy a size up if you feel you have larger upper arms,2
varicose veins,2
i bought these shirts for my husky son when they arrived they looked okay but i always wash clothes before wearing them i washed them alone in cold water and dried them on delicates with minimal heat but they shrunk into doll clothes i was going to pack these for our upcoming trip in a few days but now i just wasted money and he doesnt have shirts so upset,0
dont order this bracelet it is sized for a child youll have to grease your hand to squeeze it on and off therefore it will limit you wearing it it will just stay in my jewelry box until i eventually just donate it to goodwill,0
very little support cup seems designed not to shape or at least contain breast tissue the little support it gives hangs everything from your shoulders shoulder straps cut into my shoulders i wore it so i cant return it i know bra sizes and i know what to expect and how to make most bras work even if they are not ideal but this one doesnt,0
i loved the look of these earrings they have stones on the backinside of the earring so when you look at them head on you see a whole hoop with stones i did want to say they were a little heavier than i wanted my lobes did feel a bit uncomfortable after wearing them on a 10hr work day the the piece that clips the earring rod to the hoop to keep them in was very sturdy though i didnt have any issue with them trying to fall out so that was great all in all i give them 4 stars,2
the only complaint i have is the top 34 buttons pull apart when they are up on your calf i had to pull and adjust them to avoid the gap on one of them the lace on the top is starting to pull away but a few stitches should fix it they stayed up fine over jeans but with shorts or a skirt they do slink down to the ankle if i paid more for these i would be less happy but they were cheap so i wasnt expecting much,1
the ones i received are not solid purple like the picture i picked these because of the purple trim they were different from the other masks i can still use them just disappointed,1
these earring are nice but the magnets do not hold as well as what we thought they would they tend to fall off some are stronger than others you have to find a matching pair of strong back magnets so you dont loose an earring be careful so you dont loose one,1
suit was cute and seemed to be quality material for the pricebr however it seemed to be sized for someone under 5 feet im 54 and the position of the bra showed cleavage chest and the side of breasts i didnt try to adjust the straps or cups since the length of the suit overall didnt seem normalbr i normally wear a 1820w and 38d i ordered the 4x i ordered another style by cocopear for that one i probably could have gone down a size on it ill review it as well,1
this isnt a sweater more like a long sleeve shirt not great for staying warm the material is thin,1
i am very pleased with this top it has a very flattering fit and is super comfortable i think i could wear it most of the year good with pants or a skirt will probably buy more from this designer,2
a little to many pears but outhouse fine,2
i got this in july and really what its very thin and looks terrible the angels look nice but everything else is so bad i hate how thin it is this shouldnt be for sale,0
buckle is made of high quality materials adjustable belt five stars,2
super cheaply made but cute designbr the metal medallion has turned green after a few months,1
love these super comfy true to size however i have my doubts about their authenticity because ive had multiple pairs of these flip flops and these are by far the cheapest feeling ones the straps are incredibly thin,1
cute dress but its a little heavy it was also very short i am 5 10534,1
they are ok a little too large for flats,1
when the product works it works well however i have had connection problems with both plugs not wifi connections but actual power connections the sockets seem to turn off and not allow power to flow through them on a regular basis then i must unplug the socket for a few minutes then plug it back in and turn it on they also have randomly turned off and on lights that are plugged into them i will be returning these products,0
its soft and comfortable material and fine with jeans i got this to to wear with leggings its just a little too short i have a short torso so it would probably be shorter on someone with an average or long torso,2
cheap plasticky pale dangly things with bumps never would i ever wear them,0
perfect quality and fit love the pockets,2
lights dont stay flashing too longnot sure if its the batteries or cold weather they are nice though even without the lights,1
fit great love the fit look and warmth,2
i went against my better judgment and ordered these pants because they were just so cute but all the reviews saying they fit weird are 100 correct i ordered a large and they might as well have been a small i am a size 6 and while these technically fit the waistband which is elastic was too loose and i could barely move my thighs when i sat down in them the waistband bunched up and made it look like an extra stomach or something just a very weird fit overall i dont recommend these pants unless you have very skinny thighs i will be returning them and not reordering,0
this is a nice sweatshirt but its a lot thinner than they used to be not really pleased with that but they fit the same and the material is very soft just disappointed that the quality of the material has gone down shouldnt have been shocked since that seems to be the way everything is these days,1
i usually dont spend more than 25 for a pair but i learned you get what you pay for except for overpriced designer brands so this is slightly above my range and so far theyre good enough sunlight gets through without bright or dark the frame fits well on my face and seems durable which i have to see after a longtime use but like someone below commented i didnt expect these to be mirror finish the description of the product never mentioned that and the photos didnt look like mirrorfinish this is one disappointment,2
didnt like,1
fits much smaller than expected,1
really cute set has so much potential was hoping my daughter could wear them on her first and second hole but half of them arrived so bent from shopping that weve had to mix and match i was able to straighten one with pliers but the other one broke as i tried to bend it straight they are a cute shape and have a minimalistic look the sizes vary just slightly so they can be worn coordinating in multiple piercings or on their own since they all go together well they mix and match nicely backs are a thick clear rubber arrived on a card in a small paper envelope without padding little pearls and sparkles are so dainty and cute seems like theyll wear nice ill update once i observe if they irritate or turn green,0
actually this is probably an okay watch but it just didnt seem like the quality i expected i have two wenger watches and enjoy both of them so i had high expectations with this one one of the things that caused me to send it back was that the bezel didnt turn in any direction it is supposed to be unidirectional but i couldnt budge it in any direction another issuse for me was the overall feel and look of the watch just appeared to be a 34stamped34 out version with no real feel to it if i didnt already own a couple of wenger watches i would have to sense of comparison this one just wasnt up to wenger standards,1
very cheap flimsy material,0
i almost didnt purchase this because the only other review was that it wasnt soft however i liked the style and colors so i figured id try it out and return if it didnt work out however the material to my surprise was in fact soft they fit great i like tucking in the front of the shirt into the pants the black is a little see through but not bad for the price im super happy the material is more basic not stretchy like athletic wear more like soft thinner pajamas i wear them out or at home im pregnant so for doctors and appointments these are going to be great and hanging out with baby when it comes,2
matches the picture very well great aesthetic but fail to block out the sun and fall apart very easily these are very high mantience or good for one use type glasses,1
i have to say im a little disappointed with these reviews and they were misleading many people said they also got a tongue bar which i did not receive that was one of the reasons i bought this though i was wanting to have them all match but thats okaybr the quality of these seem average ive only worn them a day or two so far however they are smaller than expected both the balls on the end and the barbells these are best suited for girls with c cup or smaller breasts or if you have tiny nipples not sure how long i will end up using them because of this reason,1
the goodbr nice appearancebr long battery lifebr configurable notificationsbr variety of watch faces and appsbr easy setupbr br the badbr costbr br overall the pebble steel is a bit of a luxury item but it performs well and looks nicebr br setup the pebble steel comes with the watch and charging cord however it is up to the user to supply the charger that accepts a usb connection if you are like me you have plenty of these from other devices however if you do not just know that you will need an additional accessory just to get up and running the watch charged in a couple of hours and then it was on to the pairing process i installed the pebble app on my samsung galaxy s5 and it was easy to get connected android is all about notifications and the pebble app lets you control which ones go to the watch on a per app basisbr br watch faces the android pebble app is where you go to get watch faces and apps for the pebble i wanted my pebble to look like a normal watch and i went with the analog watch face that comes from the factory while that may seem boring pebble has a wealth of others to choose from including various bands and tv shows you can choose as subtle or outlandish as you desire and the bottom line is that you have choices there are also composite watch faces that include weather notification counts and other items too however be advised that everything that updates the display has a cost in battery lifebr br apps the pebble store has a number of apps to choose from too while there are many for weather sports email and text responders i chose to keep things simple i have dashboard controls phone toggles here to there gives estimated travel time to saved destinations and trello list management such as shopping lists there are also apps for evernote and wunderlist but i found the trello watch app worked best for shopping listsbr br usage i bought my pebble for a pretty specific purpose i keep my phone on vibrate during working hours at a minimum and i often missed calls or text messages with the pebble i am able to see when i get a call or a text and the information display provides useful information to me on the spot i can see who contacted me along with the contents of text messages i also like that i can dismissignore phone calls from the watch the other notification that i have sent to my pebble is calendar reminders it is handy to see where my next meeting is without having to pull my phone out finally i find it much easier to manage the shopping list without having to constantly unlock my phone as you may have gathered the pebble steel is a pure convenience for me albeit one that does what i want it to quite wellbr br battery life battery life is heavily dependent on usage,2
fits well have not worn it for active use yet but trying it on it was comfortable,2
way too small,0
roll up doesnt go down to my hips,0
i bought the small for my 11 year old it fits her with room to grow,2
our son never took to this item the ends would fall off whenever he took off his glasses we found that a thinker frame pair of glasses served him better than this eye wear retainer,0
last a lifetime i can walk up vertical ice with these the best,2
i picked these up mostly for their color for my 14 year old tennis player they match their uniforms he has worn them to tennis 45 minutes each time exactly 12 times and they are already showing signs of wear the fronttop of the shoe where the white rubber is supposed to be is completely gone they seem to run a little bit small he has a handful of other shoes in 95 but these are the smallest ones he has embarrassingly his coach told him on like the 3rd day he wore them that next time we are going to buy shoes to check with him first so if youre buying these for your elderly dad to wear around the nursing home they might be alright but if you want to wear them outside i suggest buying something else,1
hermoso,2
this is a beautifulextremely well made watch having said that i cant understand invicta wanting this sent back yearly for adjustments ive owned better timepieces in the past and never had to deal with an issue like that i cant really say if i would purchase another invicta product im adding to my review after living with this watch for nearly two years its crap my first impressions were so far off the mark that im embarrassed to see them here the watch keeps terrible time and theres no way on earth id send this back to the factory and pay their ridiculous charge for an adjustment steer clear,0
love these shoes lightweight and comfy,2
the plastic handle is cheap and some of the metal hinges started rusting very quickly but overall it hasnt been bad its a little better than bargain bin umbrellas and the cost above them goes to the novelty so its not a bad buy in all mine came with a cloth carrying sleeve rather than a plastic one as others have wrote about i dont use it regardless just because it covers all the umbrella looking parts and i dont need all the questions about it p,1
dont do it,0
the product is exactly as described in every way and it is perfect all the cards fit in nicely unlike some other reviewers i have no problems with the way it closes in terms of the placement of the cards and there is plenty of room for everything without being bulky and i have no trouble snapping it shut nice that it has two snap locations in case you only have a few cards and want it to close more tightly i only wish i had chosen a brighter color i got the medium blue color and it is pretty but subdued and i should have gone with one of the red tones,2
easy to use does the job well,2
cheaply made,1
length not good and did shrink in wash,0
ive been looking everywhere for these watch faces and was so thrilled when i located here on amazon when they arrived i was just as thrilled they are perfect for the bead projects i have them intended for,2
beautiful necklace feels like connected to nature after wearing i like it,2
got medium for my 6 year old size fit length wise but the tights were loose around the foot my daughter is picky so she wouldnt wear them,1
i got a lot of compliments on it and it is super cute but it had a small string pulling loose from the front of the dress when it had arrived which only got worse after i put in on and the straps wouldnt stay on my shoulders,1
bought this bad last minute for a trip and it worked perfectly looks very stylish and goes with everything easily fit everything i needed to carry including a small water bottle strap was adjustable so you can wear it on one shoulder or as a crossbodybr br update strap ripped and broke less than a year after buying,1
great shoe fit as expectedbr br updated review after only 3 months the shoes are coming apart probably will not buy again,2
great looking watch but the clasp pops open and watch falls to the ground i have resorted to putting clear tape around the closed clasp and band,1
a bit heavy on my head but the size is good,2
had to send these shoes because they werent wide enough i would love to have them if the size was a little bigger,1
i bought these socks for barre and pilates but they are quite large and the nonslip doesnt extend to the toes stability wise i do not like them but they are okay for comfort i suppose,1
love it however the clasp easily comes undone and i have to keep fixing it,1
wore 1 time button fell off washed it then all buttons came offbr dont buy these shirts,0
they are beautiful earrings but the right earring is a backwards e if you turn the letter the right way it is higher up on one side does not look good at all,0
item was not as described its clearly made from spandex or polyester and it was labeled as cotton,0
color is not what it looked like in image,0
way too large,2
weight and feel of watch is good but i honestly dont feel it was worth 65 this is at most a 30 watch scratches real easily i am not unhappy with this purchase but i wouldnt buy another one either,1
my husband wears a size 11 always has i ordered the large size of these slippers because it was to fit an 1112 but believe it or not they are snug he liked the color brown and how well made they appear hes wearing them and were hoping they stretch his old pair had torn so we were in need of a new pair and none of the local stores had size 11 hopefully the manufacturer will change its size chart,1
she loves it,1
this is a perfect fit for my iphone5 it keeps me from having to carry a large purse when i only need my phone it also has pockets for license and credit card,2
i ordered 3 sizes larger just to be sure i could have possible gone with 2 sizes larger it was a little big in the chest midriff so i washed it and it shrank to just the right size i am only 5 and i wanted it just below the knee so i had to hem it about 2 inchesbr i purchased this dress for and 1940s dance it was perfect i got several favorable comments on my choice,2
levi product as expected fit was correct,2
really disappointed with these pants,0
while it is pretty in appearance it lacks quality my daughter put it on and the clasp broke the first time she wore it i guess you get what you pay for,0
i love the look of this watch the grain stands out and it does get noticed the wood is smooth and darker than the picture the links were very easy to remove without any damage three stars the pin connecting the clasp to the band fell out within a few hours of wearing it i could not find it so now i have to go buyfind another one i really like this watch just not happy with the hassle,1
this swim suit is not for an adult its for a child it is extremely small and i couldnt even try it on tyr needs to update their size chart to reflect the real size of this item it might fit a 5th grader,0
i ordered this dress and love the style a small was too large for me i reordered another just in case since the one i received seems to have been worn before and mightve been stretched out the body was slightly loose but the chest was too baggy not flatteringly as shown in the picturebr br im hoping they try making an xs,0
memeory foam isnt the greatest and the bottoms of them really hard and you can feel them through the memory foam,0
great shirt for summer workplace,2
i gave this a 3 because i returned it i wanted something for my ipad but i didnt read the demensions i only went by the picture the quality was good and had it been a little bigger i would have kept itbut that was my fault,1
nice shirt but they dont last even when washed carefully lots of fuzz balls fabric doesnt stay new looking for long disappointing given that they are not cheap,0
the shirt is really cute however the material is very thin especially the shoulder straps after receiving the product and being able to see it up close it is definitely not work the 2198 i paid for it i think the quality of the material makes it worth maybe 1000 the tank makes for a decent lounge shirt though,1
,2
build seems good but time will tell i purchased the style with the velcro closure having ordered the loafer which i could not get my foot into there are to raised pads on th bottom of the slipper the pad under the heel makes the heel uncomfortable my slippers are a half size larger than my normal size and they barely fit i am hoping they will stretch a little to summarize comfort out of 10 75 build 7 because of sizing,1
as you can see this set is tangled it came out of the packaging tangled it took me over an hour to untangle to wear,1
i returned these because i did not like the way the front pockets are cut but the haggar shorts are great for the golf course i have several pairs of a different style just not a fan of this style,2
weird boxy fitbr i returned itbr good quality shirt though,1
bought two first is great if second was as first would give 5 starsbr br second is not water resistant at all gets steam inside after a shower takes days to dry out otherwise good product,1
this item comes much smaller than advertised i got the xl and am smaller than the dimensions listed however it was so tight i had to cut it off of myself also very cheap stickers for the badges this should cost anymore than 10 to 15 bucks,0
hope they fit,2
these were very nice camis but the fit just wasnt right for me the inner shelf bra wasnt right enough around my bust to support me so i had to return them,2
i am 51 my legs are short have hard time finding jeans leggings fit tight in right places n bagging in wrong places these were baggy in lot places not good fit for me sadly,1
hard to put on myself but i like it,2
this jacket is okay but not great there isnt enough heated places and the outer shell does not block the cold,0
it is kind of okay and it wasnt like in the picture and the golden hanger is looks like cheap and i returned back,1
very cheaply made,0
very tiny sweater,0
this shirt is super cute form the front but the frills stop at the shoulders and dont continue to the back the back of the shirt is plan and it makes it look incomplete and cheap from the front it looks like the decorative elements continue all the way around thats how these kinds of shirts are supposed to be i guess thats why none of the amazon product images show it from the back,0
its not worth the money i am very disappointed with the picture it didnt made justice do not buy this item,0
super cute tee with the perfect stretch,0
everytime i moved in this shirt it was slipping and sliding all over couldnt stand the feel,0
very flattering,2
i had to glue each of the eyes back in place it wasnt a huge thing to fix but slightly disappointing,0
they tend to roll up while wearing and come off while wearing my pants,0
fabric is very thin and snags easy it looked ok for about 15 minutes until the chair st church snagged it,0
the good 1 fit is good 2 warm as heck almost too warmbr br the bad 1 fabric seems cheap pilling literally after one wearing espcially on the mock neck collar chaffing against neck whiskers 2 pilling even anywhere it chaffes the next layer 3 washing causes pilling 4br br the ugly 1 i dont think i would wear this as my intended under layer to my work even with our casual dress code looks too crappy around the neck and anywhere its not covered good for round the house and outdoor work and activities is about all too bad,0
just ok,1
love this set such great quality reminds me of my gymshark sets,2
this fanny pack is really cute ive received lots of compliments from both men and women the pockets are a good size easily fit everything i needed with room to spare and theyre well placed leaving this pack to be very functional unfortunately the zipper on the secret pocket in the back broke after 3 days of use if youll be using this pack for a festival and arent interested in long term use then its an ideal option however this isnt a long term solution to serious fanny pack needs,1
very comfortable i ordered it for a trip to colorado and was perfect,2
she said their to big and we ordered he normal size,0
the length of this dress is perfect for 1or 2 inch heels or flat sandals im 53 and it was a perfect fit good quality fabric and very comfortable fit,2
you get what you pay for,1
these earrings are super cute once you get them on but thats very hard to do by yourself the piece that goes through your ear moves a lot when youre trying to connect that piece to the other half of the earring making it very hard to do it took me about 510 mins just to get one earring on i hope it gets easier in the future but youd almost have to have two people to get it to clasp its very inconvenient if it wasnt for that i wouldve given these earrings a higher review they have a bit of weight to them but nothing too bad for the most part theyre very light and i love the way the seem to shine in the light due to the texture,1
beautiful watch from kenneth cole however there was no protective piece between the stem and the watch itself and no plastic cover on the crystal the watch was running when i opened the package i would never buy a watch in a store unless it wasnt running and had the stem pulled out or a piece of plastic to keep it from running so i imagine ill be at the mall watch station soon purchasing a 1520 battery,1
i received the wrong shoes,0
works but almost too small be aware and size up,1
i normally wear a hanes 2xl tshirt i ordered this jersey in 5xl and it fits skin tight,1
wore the pants 2 days of skiing they tore in the crotch the 2nd day very disappointed should have taken the other reviews to heart they werent very good either,0
very beautiful but way super longgot 5 inch heels and hoping to actually wear itits just too pretty not to,1
i bought this carbon fiber wallet for my husband and he loves the look and feel its a durable and unique wallet and love that it has rfid protection it holds all of his business and credit cards receipts and photos would recommend and will repurchase when this one wears out,2
this product was cheap and overrated would not recommend but if you like thin plastic on your body then sure,0
nice color nice material but quite large,2
my sons teacher loves how unique it is good gift for someone younger,2
great fit very nice and comfortable hat for playing golf,2
theyre exactly as described shipped quickly,2
product was delivered timely but was much smaller than described it has been returned,0
product came wrinkled and smelled bad in packaging fit was way bigger than expected awful outfit,0
very pretty bright colors exactly as it appears in the photos a little cheap but much more interesting than the jewelry we can currently find at stores like claires its nice that this set comes with a necklace and matching earrings but one of the earring findings hooks was detached from the beads when i opened the box i am a jewelry maker by hobby so this wasnt a big deal and i just reattached it using my jewelry pliers i got the green red set and look forward to wearing it around the holidays,1
did not fit like the picture it doesnt matter how you wrap it around yourself to much of my chest was hanging out,0
this band does not fit do not buy these bands i gave it one star because i liked the print i wasted money on two of these bands only one out of three fit,0
i purchased this to wear to a costume event overall the quality is ok for a mass produced product my biggest complaint is the nose piece for the plastic mask the nose piece is solid so if it is smaller than your nose it will squeeze your nose shut or partly shut while worn this was uncomfortable and made breathing through my nose difficult if the nose piece was wider it would have worked better and i probably would have given it 45 stars,1
too easily scratched,1
perfect gift for a latch key kid,2
earrings are attractive and they are lighter than i thought they would be they look good enough to wear with a dinner outfit the workmanship looks good the finish looks a little brassy but not overly still no one would mistake these for expensive earrings,1
i have purchased several of these i really like the way they flow and they wash nice,2
love it i am glad i have bought it,2
i purchased this set of eyeglass straps to use with cheap reading glasses i typically have several pair of readers around house so decided to try wearing a pair around my neck rather than constantly searching for readersbr this set of eight straps was inexpensive upon receiving them my first impression was the straps looked very flimsy i tightened first strap i tried and it broke ive since attached straps and used the included antislip hooks but hooks fall off followed by the strap cant imagine these straps holding up during active use with sports glasses anyway ill try again with the antislip hook but afraid ill just end up tossing the whole set in the trash glad that i didnt waste more than 9,0
disliked fact that gray capri i ordered ft perfectly but when i ordered second pair in black they are smaller same size xxl but why smaller tighter in black,0
these tops look so cute in the pictures but for me not so good in real life looks as though its made inside out which doesnt show in the picture length was already too short for me but after laundering it was even shorter of course i dont look like the model but i was very disappointed in these tops,0
ordered a size too large,1
i love how comfy they are,2
definitely the best costume for the price,2
the hat is okay it arrived in a plastic bag wrinkled and the brim a bit creased it had a chemical smell that went away after a while quality was less than i expected loose threads clearly visible here and there costco carried a hat with a back flap but the quality was much much better and the price about the same i dont know if the brim on the costco hat was as wide the inside of the brim is made of polyethylene pe a foamlike plastic used to make disposable visors the pe helps keep the brim from getting floppy and at the same time maintain some flexibility the wide brim in the front and on the sides does a good job of keeping the sun off my face which is the primary reason i purchased it the lightweight material keeps my head from getting overly heated dont expect to make a fashion statement with this cheaply made hat honestly you will stick out like a sore thumb if you wear this hat poolside at the hilton its great for gardening if you pack it for travel expect it to get wrinkled the darker colors will not show the wrinkles as much as the lighter ones if youre more concerned about sun protection and not about looking chic this hat will do the trick,1
i love the design and uniqueness of the glasses i absolutely love this,2
the reason for getting this is an orthopedic problem it was almost impossible to wrestle with putting them on,0
its a cute bag but evident that its not the best material you get what you expect for the price after a couple days one of the zipper things fell off the second zipper hole cheap price so cheaply made,1
good purse with several compartments inside a little on the heavy side with nothing in it and a little larger than i expected but its cute and the black goes with anything,2
i ordered a dark grey linen cotton dress and overall it was fine from reading the reviews the size chosen was larger than i usually wear as it definitely runs small what was interesting is that one sleeve was about 3 longer than the other not much quality control,0
measurements on size chart are not accurate and fit is much smaller then described,0
buyer beware used this suitcase for one trip and on the second one the inside zipper broke with very little effort and hours later the handle wouldnt retract so is now stuck in the up position and airlines wont check your bag with a broken handle amazon wonderful as ever refunded my purchase after i called about this issue but id steer away from wasting your money on this poorly made suitecase terrible thing to have to deal with while on the road,0
the only thing i like is the color i normally wear a 2x so to be safe i ordered a 4x i ordered it on 92722 just received it today 102022 it was truly not a 4x and is half as long as the picture presented on amazon i sent two emails and asked for a refund one time i believe but havent got one so disappointed,0
a bit bigger and thicker than i expected id say the are 12mm maybe 14 the are not heavy but you do feel them if you shake your head i was looking for a smaller earring but these are ok they are pretty,1
had to throw them away too small odd shape made them impossible for a 18 month old to walk in them very poor construction,0
this wallet was advertized as blocking rfidthe very reason why i bought it it does not work i tested it and it failed i put the card that i used in this wallet in a different rfid blocking wallet and that one worked highly disappointed,0
love pockets good lengthbr material much thinner than i had hoped or expected,1
it fits as expected but its long and looks weird on my daughters head,1
headline says it all huk is one of my favorite shirt lines but this one has a rough feel to it unlike most of their products that are crazy soft and smooth,1
this necklace changed color turned black,0
the toe is very wide and can be uncomfortable in shoes,0
the first second i open the box and tried to install this band is broken please think carefully if you are about to purchase this,0
a little big,0
did what was needed but i am selling it,1
this does run very small i bought a 2x which is my normal size and boy was it tight too tight to really wear another sweater underneath which is necessary where i live i was a little disappointed since i was exchanging another coat for this one,0
holds everything and many compartments would like in a different color than blackkinda boring for me,2
not crazy about the print its a lot more dull irl and the fit around the bust was loose i was very uncomfortable wearing it,1
from a distance this skirt looks cute but up close the fabric looks very inexpensive especially the gathered fabric waist i think the way it gathers didnt look very flattering on,1
i ordered the khaki this feel super low quality and flimsy i also found it odd fitting on me,0
this came to me smelling very bad definitely not a one size fits all not a good item,0
first i really really like the purse yes its big but i carry a lot of stuff and it has room for everything i need i absolutely love the color i got the red one its more a brick red not bright at all but i was terribly disappointed when within a week the button fell off and believe me i was very very careful every single time i opened the bag which was probably only 4 or 5 times i made sure that the loop would be loose before i unhooked it from the button so that there wouldnt be any pulling on the button because i could just see it breaking or coming unlacedand it did since the purse is lined there was no way to restring the button back on without cutting open the lining i did manage to tie the leather lace together on the underside of the button and it has so far stayed on but i really dont have high hopes that it wont come off again i just think the button could have been attached in a better way so this wouldnt have happened,1
so tight around the waist,0
this shirt was too small need to send it back,0
love the socks but every time i order based on their size chart based on shoe size the socks are huge and im stuck with bunchy sloppy imtrippingoverthem socks,1
runs small very short like brittany spears oops pit the limo crotch shot short,1
bought this for my brother we are lifetime kc chief fans and of course love our qb i thought he would just look at me and think i had lost my mind wish i could post his picture because he does wear it every once in a while for a few minutes on game days and took it on a family skiing vacation we havent seen him with a full head of hair for many years and to our surprise he looks great with it on its been a surprisingly fun gift,2
i am 53 125 lbs i really wanted to like this but didnt fit my midsection gave me muffin tops looks better on someone with a smaller waistline,1
i bought this for my wife and she loves them so much i had to order more and they are so soft and cute,2
this dress is darling it fits well it is comfortable the armholes are an ample size the dress flatters the figure love it i have it in two colors,2
good quality just what i was looking for,2
the band is great but the ring started turning two days after i received it,0
i like that it stand up by itself and is attractive but it doesnt look as smart and expensive as the picture the side of the tote in the picture look narrower and more solid it says it is a leather crossbody bag but in the description is say pu leather which it looks like there was no small zipper pouch included either however what i like about it the zipper folds down inside and the bag has a wide opening for easy access i can use this tote when so doing lite shopping it has a zipper compartment along with two other pockets where i can put my phone and wallet the color is a dusty pink the tote come with sturdy handles or a durable adjustable shoulder strap it would work for shopping traveling work or whatever else you can think of it look easy to clean i cant say how durable it will be until i use it for a while,1
my 2yo loves these shoes theyre her absolute favorite she always asks to wear them they are flexible soled warm and cozy,2
nice thick material just wish the bottom had a little taper or some elastic to make it a little less boxy still i like this shirt a lot,2
got this as a replacement for one that didnt work from the get go now 2 months after wearing it just shuts off in the middle of the day and wont turn back on waste of money,0
they only offered this in small which i normally wear however this was too small and they did not offer a medium,1
cute dress however everytime i lifted my arms the dress lifted all the way up had to return it,0
love it,2
i have some other zip it socks they developed holes in the toe area after a year so i needed a replacement however these are thin low quality socks which your feet will get cold in immediately not only that but the pockets are extremely small such that i had to take them off and insert cards one by one they barely fit a credit card at all i like to keep a few cards and money and sometimes even other stuff these pockets are way to small and difficult to get anything out due to the ultra small size i regret my purchase and instead will try to repair the holes in my old pocket socks or get pockets sewn into some good quality smartwool socks myself,0
i have really sensitive skin these are super itchy to me they cover my entire arm and have good stretch,0
super cute but after a few months its starting to tarnish on the wire but thats normal,1
loved it the first time i wore it it fit perfect then after one wash in cold water it faded drastically curled up on the bottom and zipper was funky,0
there is no way these sunglasses are actual coach sunglasses they are super light and cheap as i was taking them off my head the lens popped right out of them i barley pushed in it i pushed lightly on the other one and yep popped right out i took my other coach sunglasses out which i have had for 7 years and never had a lens pop out once to compare neither lens popped out with pretty firm effort the quality of these were in no way compared to the quality of my original ones they instantly got returned very disappointing,0
i have ordered these in serval colors and have returned a few please size up regardless and f their sizing chart,1
cute top no stretch fit everywhere but in the bust had to return,0
super cute on my 2 year old but four days of wearing and the toe part is tearing apart already might not make it til winter,1
the top of this sock is extremely tight on me i measured and bought a size large but it really digs into my lower calf the foot part is very long and actually covers my toes i wore it for 10 minutes and had to take it off as it was cutting off the circulation in my leg i wont be able to use it,0
feels kind of thin but probably great for summer bought as a gift,2
would have given it five out of five but i perfer a collar that doesnt lay flat other than that its a good shirt,2
my teen loves this jacket its lightweight and fit is ok but there are no washing instructions,2
ordered a large 30 waist was way too small ordered xl and they were marked xl but just as tight no more orders from me,0
was listed an an infants but it was for adults had planned to have my sons pictures made but now have to order something new,0
is not like in the picture didnt like it at all,0
yup am wearing it like it alot very happy with it ty,2
they fit as expected but the look is more like thin pjs i wont be wearing them out anywhere,1
very cute flattering and fits true to size not sheet at all,2
the product was very good but was little bit bigger for my wife so ended up returning it didnt have time to get another because it was meant for baby shower,2
i am hard on glasses in general i have a habit of not keeping in a case i bought two pairs of these and they are exactly the same both held up wonderfully i have to admit that i dont wear them any other place but driving so they dont see heavy sporting use or on and off in and out of my purse kind of thing so if you are like me and just want a good polarized pair for light use these are great,2
i love the concept and the feel of not having a belt buckle however i wear a radio phone knife and a bunch of keys for my work with this belt which i got to use for work almost tears the belt loops out of my jeans when i tighten it so it keeps my pants up not for work but definitely for not at work,1
the socks themselves fit pretty well and are soft i was expecting them to be a bit more rough but very comfortable the only thing im knocking off from the rating is the fact that the print was a bit stretched and not perfect circles im not talking about when they are put on your legs obviously they will stretch then but the pattern is still skewed when it was printed overall im happy but they could do a bit better since an accurate print is the whole point of the product,1
videoidb38e7f421fe4bf258330577956a0c95b i wanted some extra bands to switch up the colors i wear this is great for the price,2
bought two pair on different orders 36 38 seemed decent but 36 was too small and 38 way too big talked to volcom before returning both volcom stated no problem returning them togetherbr wrongbr one gets refunded the other disappears into the ether i contacted volcom after and of course no one said that should have emailed rather than chatted a 50 lessonbr trust but record everything,0
i am giving these 3 stars only because i like the color the left shoe tongue keeps bunching up on the top of my foot which starts to hurt after 5 min so i constantly have to adjust them on top of that the holes on the shoe look so cheap with the stitching because the holes are way smaller than where the stitching is so you can see the fabric on the outter part of the hole then the stitching making them look super cheap will not be buying again,1
there is no way that my size 2xl cousin could fit into this shirt i purchased 2 from this company the fabric is also very thin i would not recommend,0
im on a weight loss journey and am transitioning out of bigger clothes so i needed some basic camis to get me to my next weight goal i ordered a size larger than i thought i needed large and they are still too small they are so clingy that they make every imperfection stand outbr br im going to keep them with the optimism that i will fit into them comfortably someday but for now just know that you should probably order these 2 sizes bigger than you think you need for them to fit comfortably im learning through online shopping that itt not about the number its about the fit,1
i really wanted to like this product cute color button detail soft fabric however the fabric is very thin which caused two problems 1 my undergarments were visible through it and 2 im overweight and it showed off my problem areas i am returningbr edit i am normally a size l i ordered an xl and it was snug on me definitely order up,1
they had to be returned they came with several scratches on them and i was unable to see through the scratches,0
im not understanding the positive reviews for one the backs dont even properly latch i had them in my ears for about 30 mins and immediately my ears were red youre better off getting a pair for the same price at target,0
nice quality but not as big as pictured,1
this dress runs huge order two sizes foen,0
i wanted slim fit and these arent legs are baggy and the pants run large throughoutstrange length too on the plus side the fabric is nice and soft,1
i love this gorgeous necklace when i wear it i get so many compliments i love this seller and i bought numerous items from them because they are made from the holy land in israel such detail in all theyre beautiful jewelry so happy i found them,2
love this my favorite leggings love the fit length and pockets are perfect,2
excellent fit for a big man,2
not a fan of the material its not smooth after 1 wash the material got natty disappointed,0
the watch was so small it looked like it could be for a child it did not feel like gunmetal at all and was very light there are no good aspects about this watch the shipping was on time though,0
loves my brooks and love this color scheme,2
i like that you get so many however when i first got them the knots on the stings are already coming undone so whenever i use these bags i have to take my time and be careful to not indo the knots something you will have to check with these constantly other than that they are good bags the seller just needs to fix the knots,1
great little travel tote and one of the only travel totes that has a zipper on the top love this,2
general use is ok but active is not as comfortable,1
very fragile was only able to wear once,1
these socks seem well made and i am happy with the quality and cotton content however though the length of the sock fits finethe ankles are so tight that i had to fold them over to keep from cutting off my circulation my ankles are medium size and by no means fat so i am guessing that they would only work for the very skinny should of sent them back but already wore a pair so hoping they stretch out definitely wont be putting them in the dryer,1
this was too small and definitely not something that works if you have any hips i thought there might be some stretch to the material but not enough to be comfortable wearing for any length of time and it is quite short which leaves little to the imagination ill wear it for those special moments,0
i didnt realize that this jogger pant was being sold by a thirdparty seller until after id placed my order since it was being shipped from wi i decided to go forward with the purchase shipping took too long and lacked tracking information as far as the pant the size chart didnt give measurements for small medium and large so i picked my normal size based on reviews fit was a little loose in the waist and the cut created an undesirable bubble of fabric above my behind hip fit was snug but at least not pulling at the pockets lastly the thigh fit was rather tight material quality was okay but ive wondered about the jogger being too warm length was a tad short in my opinion for reference a 6 is my normal pant size and im just under 5 4 personally i wouldnt buy this again due to the cut of the jogger and the sellers slow shipping,1
my only complaint with these boots are the tongues they had a lot of material at the seam which put pressure across the top of the foot after wearing for a week i finally took a razor blade and shaved off the excess which seems to have helped shouldnt even need to do such a thing which is my gripe,1
does the job,2
after a few months of using this i can say i like it but there are some issues this fits inside your mask and keeps the mask from sucking up against your face this may not seem like a big deal but if you have been wearing a mask a good part of the day the mask may soften up from the heat of your face and moisture from your breath allowing it to collapse on your nose and mouth every time you breath in the support frame holds the mask away from your mouth and nose creating a pocket that air can circulate better allowing you to breath betterbr br prosbr fits every maskevery type of mask we tried this with it fit into cloth paper sports mask whatever we could fit the frame into the frame has two plastic hooks on each side to help anchor it in place in standard mask see cons on this as wellbr stays in placeas long as my mask if snug against my face this frame does not move i put it on and it stays in place once i remove the mask though i have to make sure it doesnt fall outbr helps stops fogging my mask sits directly on the frame which in turn seals around my facemostly when wearing sunglasses i noticed there was little to no fogging most days i thin what happens is that he frame seals against the face and the mask seals against the frame trapping the wet breath that would travel up around the bridge of the nose to fog glasses but the mask has to be seated right for this to happenbr i can breaththis is the biggest thing the pocket created by the frame allows me to breath without the frame the masks pulls onto my face every time i breathe in i literally wear this everyday regardless of any cons being able to breath really over rides all thatbr br consbr the plastic hooks the traditional folded medical mask is what those hooks are for in theory you slide them over the folded part and it will stay in place even when you take off the mask in reality i tried doing this and it could never stay hooked part of the issue is that the mask would stretch out and unfold over my face im male and my face is longer meaning paper masks have to be opened more to cover my face once the mask is really opened up there are less folded ridges to catch on maybe a smaller person wouldnt have this issue but im not surebr shifts when talkingagain this may have something to do with the size of my face frame fits on my nose about midway up the bridge to right between my lower lip and chin when i talk my jaw moves the frame shifting my mask slightly downward when i close my mouth it shifts back up its not enough to uncover my nose but it does move on a smaller face it fits,1
so part of what i like about these shoes is how flexible they are like super bendy which is great for my feet since super structured shoes tend to hurt my feet if you are looking for something for a lot of arch support these probably arent the ones for youbr i do think for longer term exercise or if you are going to be walking for a long time i would probably go with a more quality shoe but for shorter distances this will work i honestly like these shoes for when im doing yard work or being outside with the dogs because i dont mind them getting dirty and they work well for shorter spurts,1
shoes were not comfortable on my feet so i returned them,1
i ordered an adult l and it was more like an adult xs,0
super cute and comfy,2
loved the length,2
cute but clasp broke after first wear very poor quality,0
i ordered this because my apple watch has a crack in the back sensor so it is no longer waterproof when i received this product i was skeptical on how well it would hold up underwater i used my watch to track my surfing the reason i was worried it wouldnt work was because the part covering the screen was made of thin plastic film it didnt seem to have a solid attachment so it must have been glued to the case i thought it the entire case would be more solid feeling to be waterproof since i didnt actually use it i gave it 3 stars but i didnt want to take the chance and ruin a 400 dollar watch or whatever its worth now if you just plan on taking it into the shower im sure it will work just fine but for surfing i didnt want to chance it,1
what better way to show some thanksgiving love,2
i read the reviews and ordered a size up mistake had to return because my normal size 6 is a perfect fit well constructed comfortable all over no binding in the leg i would order againbut probably wont have to because i got the 12pack and i think im set for life,2
definitely waste of money the pants came in not even close to the color in the picture the ripped parts were completely awful in design also not even close to what is seen in the picture the slim part of the pants was only around the thigh area the pants i ordered was a 34 but what i got was around a 3132 at best and the upper portion was so tight if you tried to even squat it feels as though the pants were gonna rip themselves apart ive worn size 34 all my life and my current pant sizes are 3334 these definitely were not 34 definitely not slim fit throughout bottom portion was more of a straight fit the color was the most hideous of all nothing like the picture,0
its a cheap shoe made overseas no support at all should have guessed from price,0
these are smallmuch smaller than they should be per size i normally wear a large but i ordered this in a xl it is not big enough two sizes larger than normal would be about right,1
im not sure why we have such high expectations for stuff we buy online it is what it says it is a faux wrap maxi in a black and white print suitable for work to an early happy hour the main downside of the dress is the material it is cheap polyester doesnt interrupt the hang of the dress but its just annoying and will nit be suitable in a ga spring,0
the bottoms were perfect the top however is far too large,0
the pair i received has one of the frog eyes sewn on backwards so its missing an eye fits smaller than expected i recommend getting a size up,1
i like the variety of beads one broke immediately which makes me weary of the others also im fairly slim so they are a little larger than i would normally want but they are okay,1
i loved this suit so much i ordered another one in orange and one for my girlfriendbr br i got the large and i am short and cury,2
i get compliments every single time i leave the house with this necklace on its an extremely cool item,2
cute fit great and seem comfortable i ordered for my cruise to mexico and wantdd something that was light weight and easy to slip on and off with a comfortable sole,1
these earmuffs seem warm and they fit but the are nothing short of sillylooking its faux fir with some sparkles there is too much fir so they look too big they might be perfect if someone is looking for a funtype earmuff,1
no where near 42 belt poor quality,1
fabric feels cheap and cold runs very large also baggy and unflattering,0
love the lining and looks great,2
its a pretty wig just bought for the color to see what it would look like if i would let my hair all gray only trying to keep it in was hard and it kept shedding so much i was afraid to even brush it,0
this dress makes me look chunky even though im 55 125lbs,0
depending on the jean i wear either a 2 or a 4 by the looks of the picture on the model i ordered a size 2 and they are a perfect fit for me they are high wasted as pictured which its a little more than i like the front comes above my navel and the back is even taller the denim is darker than i like i havent worn them yet but i think they will be comfortable they arent the cutest jean but hopefully will be very comfortable and that is important to me they are super cute from the front view and with washing hopefully will fade some the pockets are a little higher in the back than i like overall though they are just as pictured,2
very thin cheap metal quickly bent and subsequently broke only lasted a couple weeks,0
the fit is not that great the torso is a bit too long the quality seemed good at first glance but after the first wash it didnt hold up well will not buy again,1
i love the fit of these pants but unfortunately only a few months into wearing theyre bally and old looking really poor quality and not cheap my advicetry something else if this is what youre looking for very disappointed,0
awful slippers they offer no support and are flimsy id be better off walking barefoot would not recommend go get some slippers from walmart that are going to be twice as comfy and half the price,0
it works but it is for a taller person not under 55 and it says unisex nope but for the men it is missing a fly i bought it for a man and had to return it because of that problem so you can see how that would be a problem if a guy were to wear it under his work uniform pants,1
served its purpose but after heavy use the leather came apart at the seams,1
horrible cheap material,0
very small only b cup sizes,0
they were so cheaply made broke the dance day so disappointed,0
they arrived fast and fit comfortablyhowever after a month the sole started coming off from the rear heal on the left shoe i wasnt expecting that so soon,0
i have only owned the bra for a few short months the underwire has broken through on both sides and it cutting into my skin when i wear it this is sadly disappointing for the amount of money i spent on this,0
a universal studios pin very highquality,2
its a belt so it does its job but hasnt lasted as long as i thought it would,1
sized normally large would fit a 15 year old,2
too small but looks nice,1
pretty but the chain is cheap and breaks easy,1
the underwire is already coming out of it ive only worn it maybe 7 times really disappointed the old ones i bought never did that,0
shoe is already torn up wore first on june 5th and its now aug 3rd shoe has been torn up for 3 weeks now,0
these are great for what they are made for temporary backs they are small exactly as it says as for losing them while sleeping i lose regular backs while sleep common sense dictates these are not made for hard use if you plan on using them daily there are so many in a bag so why complain i have arthritis and i can easily put these on standard ear wires without any problems i totally love these,2
pretty,2
its a very pretty piece of jewelry and its fascinating to play with however it did not come with the ring shown in the pictures nor did it come with a beautiful gift bag as mentioned in the description,1
cant see thru the plastic,0
great for ladies with big breasts who do not need more padding no wires no extra padding very comfortable fit perfectly,2
read over reviews and the details seemed that the dress was true to size and would have a comfortslight stretch to it it was neither of these things suppose to fit xxl and its a shirt even has a size medium friend try it on and it was definitely not enough to wear as a dress on her disappointed,0
great glasses keeps the hot florida shiny sun at baybr when my wife told me the glasses make me look hotbr she couldnt see me blushing because of the great coveragebr br however the frames of one pair cracked and separated over the rightbr eye not happy i hope linvo will replace that pair,1
just beware that these have no structure they are quite difficult to pack because of this i have no choice but to keep them since i need them for a trip in two days but if i had been smart enough to order them earlier i would be returning them for something less flimsy,0
unflattering no support,0
it helps with glare of on coming lights,1
way over sized,0
i bought this for my 87 year old mom i bought it extra large so that she would feel comfortable wearing it in front of any visitors at her senior apartment she loves the look feel and softness she can easily toss ot in the wash tumble it on low and wear,2
great dress it fits as expected and is my new favorite,2
this skirt is super comfortable with just enough stretch true to size so just measure your waist before ordering its flowy and flattering i love the asymmetrical fairy hemline and its not sheer highly recommended,2
as always you can be as big as a house or as tiny as a mouse but if you are talljust forget it youre not gonna get a size to suit long legs,0
too small,1
maybe i was using it wrong but every time i put it in one of my rings it popped back out,1
it was not true to size just was very disappointed all around with this item,0
these were cute but the stud was way to big after a while i noticed when i took it out the small magnet wasnt in my nose but it was they got stuck in my nose and then one time i put one in and heard the magnets click together and i shined a light in my nose and there was 15 magnets i got them out get it was very disturbing,0
so pretty very nice material wore to a formal wedding and got compliments love the pockets,2
love it,2
i really wanted to like these earrings because theyre beautiful as pictured but they really just dont hold up to the photos shown the earrings are tinymaybe 12 long and the wire is quite thick so it works only if your earring holes are loose vs relatively tight that said once you get them in they just fall and dangle down weirdly rather than lining up along the edge of your ear i really wanted to love them but theyre basically unwearable,0
zipper broke on first tryon and based on the size chart i was not in the wrong size i would have just returned it but my package with this item was claimed to be lost and i was refunded long before the item magically appeared on my doorstep,0
dansko shoes always great,2
i purchased a few watches from this seller love the watches but the battery life isnt long after you receive wear them but still really funky cool watch,1
if you are a cd the lxl wont work way too small the cup is just not large enough better for someone with a smaller chest would be cute but definitely not sized correctly,0
i used wacoal measurement guide and ordered a band and cup size bigger it was still too small couldnt fit into the cup band ok,0
love the cell phone pocket,2
i ordered this bag seemed fine when i got it compact and cute i have used it one time and the zipper broke i will not repurchase way too expensive for such poor quality i feel totally ripped off,0
my daughter love them but i think the are too small she uses them all the time and they are very comfy im happy for that still im looking for one that are a little more bigger for her face she is enjoying them so regardless of the size issue it is a great buy,2
very good looking earrings,2
the bow is hot glued on,0
the xl size is really a med sizing not true,0
my husband got this as a christmas gift from me and he loves it because of the coronavirus he hasnt gone anywhere the first time he wears the jacket to the grocery store the bottom part of the zipper keep separatingbr this is a nice warm jacket great quality material i would love to send it back for another one if it is not too late,1
my favorite swimsuit my little guy has ever worn its so cute and the color is very vibrant,2
videoidfda5fb5d8d29186bd2d17f12927bfc65 i bought three of these for all the car keys they look great but they are too tall for modern keyless fob car keys i got one wrangled onto my volvo key and we had to use pliers and destroy the ring to get it off and it scraped the shiiz out of the top of my key didnt work on hubbies chevy truck keys either i got one onto our sons vw key but its just able to move and will be a sideways key ring in a pocket we will probably end up taking that one off as well its the same problem for a small square tile they look cool but are thicker than it would appear,1
very well constructed high quality good fit and awesome look,2
the sweatshirt is long in the sleeves but extremely short in the midriffbr seems to be fair quality material and if your goal is to show off your bellybutton then this sweatshirt is for you i would recommend ordering 12 sizes larger,0
cute but material isnt that stretchy and the item runs small so go up 1 or 2 sizes,1
very comfortable,2
just use once and its broken,0
these mk frames are one of my favorites they give off a very professional vibe yet they are very trendy i receive my compliments on them,2
very pretty but eye charm broke off first time i even wore it,0
excellent socks wellpriced nice colors and wash well,2
i ordered these for my preschoolaged daughter to wear under dresses at school they are super thin and see through but they worked for wearing under a dress i wouldnt let her wear them as shorts alone to gymnastics or anything bc you can see her undies underneath,1
they have a terrible odor to thembr 2 of the plastic button snaps dont work properly 1 wont snap the other is hard to snap to undobr they are a very light material like a flowy headscarfbr you defiantly want to add a filter,1
smaller than regular,1
particularly like the light weight and flex hinges,2
such a beautiful dress so versatile and flatteringbr you can wear it as a shift for historical costumes i have it in white as well from another seller or a nightybed gown or just a day dress and did i mention this dress was made for layering pettie coats corsets stays vests belts and so much more or you can just wear it by itself it is a bit sheer but i actually like it that way but if you dont just get a slip or camisole and problem solved lolbr its such a fun article of clothing highly recommend wish it came in more colorspatterns,2
all picture didnt show the any stitching cutting pattern and material i normally wear m or l but i ordered xl because i need some lose fit but fit perfectly it makes little smaller material is vert thin description said cotton linen but i dont think so i dont know how many time i can wash with wash machine till coming hole or ripping out oh definitely no dryer i paid only 20 i guess that what i paid for made in china,1
i bought two in large im 55 145 pounds returning the one i didnt wear for a smaller size very comfy thinner material than i thought it would be but i wore a little tank under when its cold,2
slipped them right on easy slide on without taking the strap off and the nylon strapping is extremely comfortable not scratchy at all im going to love these,2
cute variety of earrings for my granddaughter who is building her collection,2
this watch looks really nice this was given to my husband as an everyday watch however after only wearing 4 times the band came lose from the watch i put it back together and will update if it holds as for the watch itself it has kept time no issues with that,1
comfortable and clear but lenses pop out easily,2
its a little smaller than i thought it would be very cute but one of the metal brackets bent within 2 or 3 uses and so they little yellow knob fell off and i need to glue it back on but am afraid to unbend the metal in fear of breaking it i wouldnt order another one id try for a more sturdier one from another company,1
great quality socks but they are too small i wear a us size 11 shoe but these socks physically will not fit over my foot they might fit a size 9 foot,0
i loved this dress it was smooth and comfortable it was a hit at work too im definitely ordering a christmas one too,2
the shirt that i received was not brand new it looked like it had been previously worn and possibly returned the shirt arrived without any tag or packaging it was just a loose shirt inside a mailer with visible wear even if it had been brand new it was a very thin cheaply made shirt definitely not worth it buyer beware,0
returned this wallet to fat for front pocket,0
do not waste your money this set is cute and comfy however after two wears i havent even washed the top it is completely covered in pills and looks old and worn out for over 200 that is unacceptable and disappointing,0
normally horizontal stripes are not my bag this is a cute hoodie dress and if you have a nice figure so you dont accentuate the stripes then it can look nice on you it really is for younger women and the dress is well made the cotton is soft and feels very nice slightly stretchy to fit in well but again a size 8 is for a nicely figured body the hoodie section feels good over the head while using it the length is a little long for my 54 height the waist is a good fit and not too tight this is cute on the right person that being someone who is in shape and can pull off horizontal red stripes,2
either mine had a factory defect or all have a bad design at the bottom of the wallet it is sewn to close not leaving enough room to fold if you put more than 3 cards in there it will not close properly and it stays bulky i will return mine and if they send me another one like this then i know it is bad design,0
fits good and good material,2
not for big chested girls im a size large with d cups and the bodice was waaay to small plus it was sewn flat instead of curved so it made a weird wavy line and smooshed my boobs ugly instead of flattering i really really wanted to like this dress and it would look great if i had smaller boobs,1
good size for me with lots of convenient pockets,2
the quality is there for the material and how it was made super soft but it was too long and it looked a bit weird on my kid but it is super cute wish i was able to use it longer,1
i wear a 2xl i ordered a 3xl this is so undersized it probably would fit xl buyer beware,0
sadly these didnt fit so so cute wish they had adult sizes,2
soft and fancy please sell separately i prefer black and may be grey but we ended up with a pinkred pair and its a waste other would probably want pretty in pink but why bundle different colors,2
i bought these for my daugher who developed shin splints after returning to sports they were a perfect fit thanks to the sizing chart she cant wear kt tape for more than a couple of hours or her skin gets inflamed she wore the compression socks for the weekend and by monday she could feel a significant improvement great product accurate sizing chart i would buy again,2
i love this ringbr i wouldve like something with more weight but i truly love this ring,2
lighter yellow then shown but good cheap material,1
nice product,2
i like how it looks but it keeps causing snags on my pretty fine fabric blouses woven and knits causing holes,2
bought for my daughters they loved it it is costume quality but for the money spent it is a good buy recommend,1
literally such cheap quality and it sucks there are better earring out there for the same price do not recommend,0
items arrived on time however i was not impressed with packaging as they individually came in separate small clear bags within a small blue box would have been nice if the pins were cushioneddisplayed in the box other than that pins were nice as described,1
not good quality,0
beautiful dress my height 51 weight 54kgbr fits me,2
love the look of the fabric and the color very retro however cant wesr it far too much padding looks awful on,0
i ordered 3 sizes up as the asian sizes seem so much smaller than the american sizing i love this shirt the color and style are perfect for me it is so comfortable i could wear it everyday i havent washed it yet so i have no comment for that i do wonder why there are different prices for different colors but many listings do this i just wonder whybr recommend,2
very soft runs small overall decent for the price,1
muy buena calidad los mejores materiales como debería ser un producto original,2
do not look at all like the picture toooooo short,0
good quality hat i have a bigger head so its nice to get hats that can accommodate a xl noggin feels a little warm compared to the 210 delta,2
i love love love these pants oddly prana did not offer corduroy pants this year what a find to discover them on amazon overstock from last year the price is fabulous r length is nice and long a miracle and a size 6 fits perfectly i go between a 4 and 6 in most pants 6 is my goto size for prana so if you are familiar with the brand these are true to size im really hoping that prana decides to bring back the trinity cords next year but for now thank you amazon,2
i really wanted to love this dress i have a long torso for my height but the waist on this dress went nearly down to my hips if i pulled it up to sit at my natural waist it ballooned out and was just overall unflattering when the waist was sitting where it should the skirt also became a little shorter than i prefer skimming my ankles rather than the tops of my feet,0
crap,0
i love this dress my tummy area is a problem for me and this shields it pretty well very flattering on my figure it is a little sheer so i recommend layering with a tank top,2
love it perfect length im 52 i normally wear large but went with medium because of previous reviews it running on larger side i think i couldve gotten away with a small since its got a lot of stretch,2
these sunglasses are more of a novelty item than real sunglasses they are huge and make me look ridicules perhaps good for a summer party or at the beach however these are not something one wants to wear everyday,1
the zippers were both brokeni returned the pursethe return process is very easy,0
this summer i determined that the beach was going to get whatever body i gave it but that perhaps i could wrap that body in a cute swimsuit to makeup for a year of quarantine eating i ordered this swimsuit in two sizes my size according to the size chart and a size up knowing that i have a larger chest and sometimes need more room my size actually fit in the body but i was busting out of the top the size up didnt really help soooif you want a bustier look and are not afraid youll be put out of the pool park or wherever youre going or are a ddd or below this is probably a great swimsuit if you are in the g h or higher range of cup sizes this may not work,0
smaller and thinner than expected,1
the navy isnt a true navy but more like a midnight blue in low lighting it looks black,1
picture makes it look more flattering than it is not as supportive as appears in photo or per description im only a bc cup also the padded cups are partial and make for less than flattering line under some clothing,0
dont buy this if youre looking for heat buy this however if you need a good rain coat so far what i wanted it for was not what i got which was to be as similar as my old heat insulated jacket,1
i usually wear mediumlarge i ordered large this fits small and a little tight on the chest area because of the styling the neckcollar area is uncomfortable to me the fabric is a little itchy for me as well overall not for me,1
ran a little small the calf is extremely small,1
vehemently dissatisfied not at all sized the way it should be i ordered the 5xl because i wanted it looser on me and theres less than 1 foot of fabric between each arm hole in the back so if you have the worlds smallest shoulders this is the jacket for you i will be returning this first thing in the morning,0
these are beautiful plugs dont be fooled though these are not in any way shape or form real gem stones i shouldve known and am pretty disappointed as i use gems and precious stones as energy moderators otherwise theyre pretty and you get some variety with different colors and textures i just cant get past the faux stone it should be advertised as such perhaps then i wouldnt feels so bamboozled,1
very nice well made great price,2
wore out quickly color bleeds if wet,0
isnt long enough to cover your lower neck so you have exposed skin above t shirt collar,0
this shoe is great very comfortable cream color and durable for all wear i would definitely get this she in other colors,2
looks great help up for months but began to fade do not wear in the shower,1
the sandal is comfortable fits ays expected but the snake skin pattern was a little too much for me they didnt go with the vacation outfit i purchased they for most upsetting is the seller charged me a 16 restocking fee no where in the item description does it state this buyer beware watch whos selling the item,0
way too stretchy which makes them too big,0
super comfortable color is great very flattering hits at the belly button stays put no need to pull to keep in place,2
it looks amazing but the xl is way too small if the sizing was correct id give this 5 stars,0
wish it had more color to it but i love it,2
i thought the loose part would be flattering to my stomach but if youre carrying around any extra weight or loose skin in the middle this top doesnt hide it like youd think it would,1
i ordered a watch band for my apple 5 watch i ordered a 44 that is the size i normally buy i ordered a 44 this time and it almost wraps around my arm,0
its ok i actually purchased 2 of these dresses in different colors the patterns on them look great and the material is light weight i couldnt pass up 5 dressesbr i did notice the dresses did not fit the same i ordered large on both one fit perfectly and the other was a little snug the snug one ended up ripping on the seam under my arm after one wear i managed to sew it back up but im still worried it will rip again,1
the jacket is very short for those that have a big chest and i got a size bigger ive worn it once and wish i never bought it to be honest its definitely cute but not at all what i thought it would be unfortunately on the plus side it is extremely cute and very lightweight that could be a bad thing too,1
fit true to size but the jacket shed some sort of black material cute for the price,1
excellent,1
very heavy shoe 161 oz ea shoe shoe sole very heavybr if you suspend the shoe while on your foot the shoe wants to fall off from its own weight i own two other versions of rockport deck shoes this model is 4 oz heavier than the other rockport deck shoes i own 12 oz ea shoebr almost feels like wearing a hobnail boot in a way the fit is close but a little looser around the heel than my other shoes nice looking shoe the sole looks to be high traction but dense maybe there is a metal stiffener inside dont know,1
it runs a size small womens plus size full figure magiclift comfort beautifully lacy comfortable looks just like the picture wide and padded straps are adjustable in the back for best fit,2
cheap matetial actually cheaper than cheap,0
love,2
i didnt like the quality of this bag returned it,1
i love these they are perfect the high waist is great for baby and toddlers great quality,2
too small,1
i could not get the adjustment with the velcro strap to work for my foot i did not feel that they would stay on foot bed felt like a dream sent them back just not made for my feet,1
i need wide shoes to accomodate crossed toes childhood shoes were too narrow these are very comfortable and the insole is great arch support is important to me as well and these provide it nicely why dont more manufacturers make wide shoes like new ballance they get my dollars,2
sleeves too short,1
after several attempts we finally got the right color,1
i am only 51 and this apron fit me well as it allowed me to adjust the fit by tying behind my neck and behind my back it was very reminiscent of an apron worn by my mother in the 1960s when i was a young girl the quality is very good and i highly recommend this apron which also has goodsized pockets in the front,2
i only gave this one star because it broke the first time that i wore it i ordered the orange one it was very cute i had planned on purchasing this in two more colors im glad that i didnt order them before i wore this one,0
thin which is great for my cruise bright beautiful made for big boobs,2
super comfy,2
i love this bodysuit it looks amazing the only thing for me is i have a long torso so i kinda rides up but its still great,2
wears good but the color comes off easily,1
item is very see through and runs very small does not look like the picture i do not recommend,0
i like the way this look and the lenses arent too dark my only grip is the ends are metal witch tend not to feel so great on my ears when i wear them for awhile other than that a nice looking pair of shades,2
needed one that rolled easily this one does,2
asics was a brand recommence by my podiatrist i have debilitating plantar fasciitis and needed something with a stable heel cup this shoe deliversbr br the inserts are easily removed i swapped them out for some superfeet green arch supports perfectionbr br i am a nursing student and on my feet a lot these are my go to shoes for clinical rotations,2
my wife is slim and of medium height five foot six inches and this outfit was a perfect fitother reviewers have claimed this size was for a short fat individual but that was not the case at all for the outfit we received also it is very professional and can be worn at work or at church it is light and is perfect for summer wear my wife is very happy with it,2
if your looking for queen size skip these run too small,1
it was way too big have to take it to be repaired so have not worn it as yet,1
quality watch band looks just like it came from the manufacture with the watch but for half the price im tough on my watch and the band in the field and it takes the abuse with no problems highly recommend,2
great quality,2
sheerer fabric than expected also i didnt realize it had an elastic waist,1
was comfortable but had a strong chemical smell returned for refund,0
i purchased these pajamas in hope tod ins a comfortable pair for a good price i washed them before i wore them they did not wash well strings are now hanging off after the first initial wash the size was smaller i usually wear a medium they fit but were fitted i dont want fitted pajamas i like looser pajamas not super satisfied material was soft,0
the material quality is good the look is good it is let down by workmanship though little threads all over the place that are not finished tied off or cut like normal it is particularly bad at the hem where i posted a pic of the worst spot also at least one seam that should be straight is wavybr br fit i ordered a large its a bit tight at the arm pits for me larges tend to be hit or miss with me in terms of fitting here though and xl tends to be too big everywhere else the fit in other areas seemed to be okay typical for a large,0
had to add teflon tape to the hose where it connects to the sack on the inside was pretty upset to have a wet back and a wet floor for the first time trying this,1
extremely comfortable and soft feet feel cool and relaxed all day,2
i have small wrists and i tightened it all the way and is still kind of loose if you have small wrists this band isnt for you i have now only worn it five times and its stretched out not worth 10,0
maybe its because i shouldve ordered a small instead of a medium im 510 125 lbs but i went with a medium and while the pants fit relatively well at the topwaist the ankles are a little too bigwide the length of the pants appears to be inseam of 29 since they are a bit too shortbr br on the plus side its a nice rayon blend so theyre very stretchy but im not if id purchase again,1
we bought these for our children and the best men and women and they were exactly what we needed for our wedding they fit a variety of ages from 1078 years old excellent choice,2
okay but cheap qualitybr probably wrong but again,0
my grandson wears a size 2t i bought a 2t in this and the shirt is way too big the shirt fabric is also too thin and the collar gapes looks cheap,0
poo quality,0
i like the style and pattern however the top just does not give enough support and is almost too bigtoo much fabric,1
really really small i returned not usable for me,0
even in direct sunlight the watch will charge but the next day the watch is not working i have had several ecodrives and this is the first problem i have had the band will not stay in place and the mesh splits i have had over a month so am past the return date the citizen online support site also does not workbr disappointed,0
prosbr great for any bust size even a little biggerbr love the collar detail at the neck very chicbr length is as shownbr true to sizebr versatile dress perfect basic staple for any wardrobebr br consbr the material is super light and cheap i originally decided to keep this dress but after trying it on with things in my closet to make up for the translucent material i just couldnt find anything that would look goodbr br if this dress was thicker or just not see through then it would actually have been the perfect navy sweater dress but it just couldnt work out not a good dress for layersbr br this is one of the first reviews in which the pros outweigh the cons but the con is so big that it overshadows all pros boo i really wanted to like it,0
sent this back way too big and i ordered the size i normally wear,0
nice hard case screwdriver soft bag good visibilitywhen they work first time i tried to clean the lens it popped out got it fixed but now have to be extra careful when cleaning,0
not sure why i kept this and have not worn it yet i wanted something casual to pop on going to movies i ironed it and know it will wrinkle all the time that is what will make it casual,1
shirt fit as expected ordered a large fit like a large body of the shirt is a nice material but the sleeves and neck are a weird synthetic the color ordered the redblack plaid with deer silhouette was more like a fluorescent orangered the white backing on the cowl neck makes arranging the neck more tedious does have nice sideseam pockets and sleeves are a good length cute casual top dont know how it will look after washedbr update feb 2019 i ended up putting a few stitches on the cowl to hide the white backing and help it sit well works has washed well but the deer decal is showing wear i use the washer dryer,1
after two attempts to get a proper fit i got my money back,0
poor quality,0
dress was way too large for a medium will be returning,0
this item was too small and the quality was very poorly made,0
hurt my ears,1
i did not want to give this product a but that was the only way that i can respond it was too small the size was deceiving,0
very soft they are great leggings so far,2
if you are looking for royal blue or cobalt ring like the image this color is not like shown even in a sunny day outsidebr i received a ring in dark blue almost black the price is great for such pretty decent product,1
loved these but they broke after 2 months,1
some of the stitching is not right after one wearing one of the shirts developed a hole at a seam under the arm i would expect better quality control from hanes color is good but sizing is also cut a bit small im an xl usually but would have probably been better ordering a 2xl,2
love the colors fits great i order larger this would have fit in my actual size so a little roomy but super comfybr only thing is after first wash there is a hole on the seam of the leg after three washes hole in the seam of the left sleeve of shirt i only wear them once a weekbr disappointed i have to repair it so soon they were immediately my favorite jammies and just hoping no other holes pop up,0
i normally wear a large and could definitely have worn a medium,1
these pants were super short they hit about an inch and a half above my ankle and im only 54 the material is kind of stiff and doesnt seem durable i wont wear these due to the length,0
received with no screw on arm defective,0
buy more than one set 34 was hoping the black would keep it looking like new longer but it does not rusts like any mass produced ball point chain,1
the socks feel good but i was sent white instead of grey not going to send them back just do better next time,1
these are beautiful earrings they came well packaged and have a nice weight to them they feel like good quality and the stones seem nice and tight in the settings the back of the stud is tight as well so no worry about them falling out they have a nice sparkle and are lightweight enough not to weight the holes in your lobes down too much im very happy with these and the price is very good for the quality you get,2
dont wasting your money,0
i returned them they are stamped with the size on each sock and the ink from the stamping bleed over the white socks staining it,0
very attractive and im going to keep it but this is not up to previous kipling standards for this price which i was willing to pay because i considered kipling a 34cut above34 the quality should be better good points will fit under the airplane seat looks very nice well organized inside bad points lacks front pocket of previous model handles less sturdy bottom not as reinforced as earlier models,1
it was made out a silky material i like a breathable a cotton lycra blendsent them back,0
my favorite running shoes these shoes have it all for someone with strong high arches they are cushioned enough to protect my body from too much shock yet sturdy enough to provide stability to my runs i have several pairs of running shoes that i rotate through but these are by far my favorite especially for low light runs the reflectors are very helpful,2
to small for my phone my phone wont work in this purse plus the plastic was not clear,0
nothing changed colors,0
i was disappointed with the fact that the side pocket on my bag does not zip completely when i go to close it when i do theres a gap that stays open on one side when i go to zip it closed,1
nicequaliu,2
they are more for layering they are thin and the bottom irritatingly roll up when i sit down,0
the bottom rolls up its very difficult to put on and is very uncomfortable once you are wearing it i wore it the first time and have not put it on since,0
doesnt fit well,0
its a pretty wallet however ive had havent had it very long and its torn up already and i dont have that much in it so its past the window for exchange or return but i would not order this or suggest it,0
way too short doesnt wear well at the bottom fir someone my height 5934 i definoetly couldnt wear heels with it which sort of defeats the purpose for me top was fine fit though,0
well for lightening buying not sure if it was deal it is a gift and i hope my friend likes it but i personal thought it would be nicer than it was pictured,1
the tail on one earrings was broken very cheap looking earrings,0
junk,0
unable to attach,0
not enough support,2
garbage you get what you pay for the color is super dark and doesnt look at all like leatherface the hair is so bad its funny,0
excellent fit killer 80s skateboarding culture appeal,2
ring was a bit on the smaller size wish there are half sizes,0
really thinking about returning this item the fabric was similar to muslin cloth order size smaller,0
too small for the average adult head cute though can get it on but tight maybe itll stretch out,0
these pants are too high wasted for me and i found them itchy even after washed well made just not for me,1
the material was great but it fit small probably tmi but it gave me a painful wedgie so i didnt wear it out ladies if you are thicker at your bottom go a size bigger,1
the mask was good for about an hour of wear i might have a larger head howeve the amount of tension that the elastic bands exerted on the mask pushed the metal nose piece into my face itd be fine but the nose piece is a flat strip and has an edge so even with the layer or two of fabric between my nose and the wire i literally couldnt keep wearing the mask due to the pain and had to switch to a different mask i ended up replacing the nose wire with garden wire and replaced the elastic band with cloth head ties after the modifications its a great mask fits and seals well and i can talk in it without my mouth constantly brushing the inside of the mask just wish they had done the work that i had to especially at this price,1
comfortable but does not ware well i wear it in the house,0
great but very sintetic,1
terrible too small,0
from my wife the elastic is a soft elastic so its comfortable i am a 36dd and a size 12 usually this would make me a 34large34 but i wanted something a bit baggy for a cozy summer sleepwear this xl 34fits34 but with the elasticity its huge i could easily fit two of me again the elastic is soft and it fits but i probably could have gotten a similar fit or a slightly better fit from a medium,1
the quality of this product is exactly what i expected if im being honest its a little overpriced but i couldnt find another slytherine robe on amazon that looked as good i would recommend the product but would be much happier of the price was lower,2
didnt like it,1
great quality boots for doing pantry work,2
way too small and looks more like young girls shirts,1
they fit like low rise jeans and give my mom bod a muffin top nice length color material though,1
very short it barely covers my breasts,0
fit an size similar to other key brand tees ive bought collar rolls over more than the other 100cotton key shirts though,2
i had ordered a pair from a warehouse deal and loved them they were so comfortable they felt better than a pair of ariat boots but the boots from the warehouse deal had a broken boot pull on 1 boot so i thought i would order another pair to have to wear when i go out somewhere as you can see what i got was damaged and looked worse than the pair from the warehouse deal they had been scribbled on with a ink pen and had bad scratches all over both boots the inside material was real loose and wrinkled up inside 1 boot im female and wear a size 95 to a 10 in womens and got the 85 wide i size 8 would have probably been ok but i like to wear wool socks to keep my feet from sweating these are not made with the same full grain thicksmooth leather that they were a few years ago like some of the older reviews photo show so like others if you have a pair of the older boots these are not the same if thats what your looking for this feels like a cheaper feeling leather this type of leather feels like it will stretch after a little wear anyway returned due to damage,0
i ordered the gray and black combo the leather is so soft i love the color combination and of course the size is great i can fit a lot into it its not a heavy handbag have had a lot of compliments would recommend this to others,2
wouldnt cut through fabric only paper,0
i got for the hoops and the hoops are wayyyyyy to small the studs are fine but i really wanted a hoop i would have never considered these knowing they were extra small i couldnt even wear in a lip if i wanted to,0
the design is great and the fabric feels sturdy i ordered a s and it fits big at the waist 125 lbs small waist and its a little too long for my height 55 i am going to exchange it for an xs because i really like the look of it,1
great quality my son loves it,2
look cheap really thought it would look better based on the picture,0
this arrived in a beautiful box however there were no instructions included no droppers for aromatherapy oils and my box was not wrapped in plastic like my friends was the box itself looked like it had already been used it did contain a polishing cloth but i am extremely disappointed in this product im going to try disinfecting a couple of items and then ill be taking them to the lab do you have a friend examined them using medical microscopes ill update this after we get that done,0
im 54 125lbs and a 34d i ordered a small and it fits but not the way it does on the model it fits like a normal fitted shirt that ends at waist i was hoping for a fit more like the model has with a longer shirt so i wish i had ordered a medium instead you cannot put it in dryer enjoying it while i can before my husband shrinks it,2
these did not fit me like compression socks should the description states they are tightest at the ankles but for me there was almost no compression at the ankle and it was fairly tight on my calves quality wise they were full of loose threads and some pairs had snags in spots feelwise they have a slick synthetic feel when worn the prints are cute in the bag not as attractive all stretched out i wear a size 859w shoe and ordered sm as a rn i have worn many pairs of compression socks and these are the least favorite i have ever tried a return,0
theyre really pretty and all but theyre a bit to long in my opinion maybe i just have small nipples but i wont be able to wear them the balls are also oddly proportioned,1
i ordered my size based on the recommendations made and the fit was appropriate the two things that i didnt like was how much extra fabric is on the front of the shirt i knew it was the style but i looked like a balloon,0
i had to return these gloves as a medium is just to big for me,1
these boots are a good choice for you if you only plan to wear them one or two times or if youre undecided on if you want a nice pair and want to try cheap boots before a big investmentbr br quality of construction the material is a fake leather similar to an office chair that looks like it will peel within months the stitching is loose and i do not feel confident it will hold up with repeated wears the rubber sole is not the most supportive but is sufficient for light usebr br fit i am usually a size 95 boot which is what i ordered here but i couldve done with a 9 the ankle is quite wide and there is not much taper from the top of the boot to the ankle good if you have larger calves or ankles and need a little extra width the toe box is square and wide so plenty of room to wiggle your toesbr br arrival presentation the boots come in a bright nikeorange box smaller than i expected for cowboy boots the boots are folded in half along the leg shaft and that crease is not friendly you will need some sort of support inside if you want them to stand up in your closet like a traditional bootbr br as a texas gal used to wearing true western boots i will not be keeping these i do think they would be good as a first pair of boots,1
videoided7de1b1a977231a58d41bd901c75b62 i was a bit skeptical at 1st getting these for my grand daughter but she said they work great they are well made with nice and even stitching they look sexy feminine with the pretty lace around the top they are a thong style,2
i love these socks i have bought several different brands but these are the best,2
i liked the kitty design the top was great the bottom was too short it may have been better of sold with a regular pant instead of shorts for pjs,1
stitching is horrible but capris are stretchy comfy,1
i ordered a us size 1m but i got a size 3 or 4 instead the shoes is way too big need this fixed asap,0
i have worn this necklace twice now and its held up well i was a little nervous because i usually have metal allergies but ive had zero problems with this necklace,2
glasses have a bad reflection on the inside when wearing them very distracting,0
this dress runs large but the pockets are right at the hip,0
finally got the product 5 stars,2
i ordered a blue a6 jiu jitsu gi and all i got were 2 solid black large tshirts,0
i loved how much i could put in this but i decided to order their tortuga outbreaker 35l instead since we are going to ireland and scotland i just got it in and so now i have tested both i packed them both and put it on and adjusted all the straps and walked around and did household things while i kept it on this setout was a more comfortable fit even though it was bigger and more full i wish their 35l were still available the one i now have is a good size for the smaller airlines but i am not sure i will use all of the organizing that it offers which also adds to the cost and weight i tried to watch all the tutorials but the straps still dig into my breasts and it sits a little uncomfortably on my lower back so i need to keep playing with it im not sure if i will end up keeping it or not since its 299 i even considered rebuying this one again and trying to load less so i dont get charged on my flights for a bag outside their parameters,2
videoidf43a953501c1a3ecd6e6e6a8441cc7e3 this dress did not even last one wearing the strap broke after about and hour of wearing it and after washing it the seams have frayed and opened cheap garbage i should have known better than to expect anything more,0
bought for vegas trip fits nice and is flattering ordered using the measurements listed would buy again,2
updated after using if you want it just to be pretty you may like it so im giving it a 3 star rating its well made but the cloth keeps the heat in far more than my other caftans additionally i can see through the material enough that i must wear a slip to go out anywhere also not as wide as my other caftans so although it fits and i think its true to size its more constricting and uncomfortable than other caftans bought it to beat the heat so that makes it so much hotter than similar items ive purchased elsewhere that are thin but not transparent at all yet breathe well are plenty wide and comfortable,1
my ankles are not large and these ankle bracelets are tight better as a large bracelet,1
they are very nice nonpierced earrings you can set the size you need then they spring open so you dont have to screw them each time you want to wear them,2
llegaron a tiempo y son mas hermosas de lo que esperabamos,2
i dont know if there was a product mixup at the warehouse or what but i got teenytiny trimmed fur earmuffs that were heartbreakingly cheap looking and not at all like the big and fluffy muffs shown in the product description and like white ones i got years ago from a different seller needless to say i promptly returned these just a bummer,0
they showed up at my office all of the girls in the office looked at them and thought we are thought they were really pretty then i went to put them i my ear and the post fell off tried the next one same thing happened spent 15 minutes looking for the first post couldnt find it so through the both in the garbage,0
cute dress follow the size chart but i think they run a little big the fabric pills a bit after washing but for casual warm weather its fine,1
so pretty so cute the little charms fell off right away one the first day 2 more the second day just not durable and i work in an office not doing crazy stuff and throwing my arms all over or banginghittingscraping the bracelets against things just so disappointed i actually expect them to just pop and break on me but they wrenched and i suppose you get what you pay for,1
this is a cute necklace but is more suited for costuming than for wearing as a necklace to a dressy event i had hoped it would match in sheen to others that i had obtained for that purpose but did not as they were inexpensive its really not an issue as they are ok i ended up keeping them due to the sellers restock policy made it cost prohibitive to return them in addition to paying return shipping,1
i ordered 2x and it was real small order one size larger,1
great quality,2
bought these because i wanted to have my sunglasses float but they dont nice design and comfy,0
sleeves are not tight which i do not like the looseness makes it look sloppy dont like the shininess of material but otherwise fit okay,1
im typically a 12x as i yoyo a lot this didnt fit my skinny friend who is a size ml the material is weird way too small not worth it at all,0
not as advertisedthey run small,0
i wear this bra constantly very comfortable and it does not show under my clothes,2
lid broke after 3 hours they want it returned we live in a rural area so now i have to drive 40 minutes to a drop sight not worth the gas to return a 16 ring my kid was really disappointed,0
too clingy and small for me so size up i didnt return bc they will be fine under things in the winter,1
wore my in in the tuff medder tx awesome traction through 99 of the events cleats did not get bogged down with mud and the shoe quickly dispersed any water very little debris collected inside and never had to stop and adjust the shoe through the entire event a little on the under padded side in the foot bed however with the removable insole i could have swapped out for more padding which i will in the future compared to my friends merrills no removable insole his shoe seemed to fill with debris a few times these seem very durable and cleaned up quickly another nice feature of the removable insole great shoe of mud races best for off road as some of the running on paved portions i could feel the lugs on the bottom of my feet,2
i love the fabric the quality and print is beautiful but the size is at least 2 sizes too small loved the shirt but need to send it back and wait for the right size very bummed out was planning to wear it today,2
these are fine just as advertised however the crotch is about half the length it should be that is a serious defect never experienced this problem before with other brands my search for the perfect pair of undies continues,2
these hats look great and i cant believe how reasonable the price is,2
nice and big washed it before i used it and the colors did not fade or bleed arrived on time very happy with purchase,2
cute dress up,2
i bought this for my boyfriend who is shorter but muscular than i am in an extra large it fit so snuggly that it was uncomfortable for him which he is a 34x30 at 56 so i am instead wearing it and it is snug on me as well im not sure ill get much wear from this since the pants barely reach my ankles now im 59 maybe purchase 2 sizes up instead of 1 size,1
perfect fit,2
not true to color bought 2x fits like large i return it material is not true to picture,0
from the looks of this belt itll hold up maybe 3 months if i dont wear it much most of the main belt feels like plastic its made in china and not completely full grain leather,0
granddaughter loves them she is a new mother and needed something comfortable,2
omg looks like its made for an american megirl doll ridiculous,0
i returned these as they were too small my old asics were the same size but these were too small,1
honestly i like them but my straps came ripped hanging off the pants the fabric was tattered and im really bummed about it,0
it was sewn incorrectly,0
smaller than xxl in shrink or sweaty rocks xxl i would say the xlxxl is a xl,1
wanted to like them ended up giving them away i have no idea how your foot is supposed to be shaped to make shoes like that fit i swear the toe box is actually narrower than the heel and it didnt break in at all,1
the material is very cheap and the color was not as expected its like shiny dance material there is also a huge seam running up the front that i didnt notice in the photo very unflattering forget about returning it they dont offer this but instead will give you a whole 4 back if youre lucky cross your fingers and hope you like them otherwise a total waste of money,0
this was too large,0
beautiful bracelet great price quick shipping,2
these were a birthday gift to a friend of mine she loves them i have a similar pair in an oval cut i wear them almost everyday they go with everything theyre 34my new diamonds34br they are a worthy and affordable investment in your wardrobe,2
great fit daughter looked adorable in would recommend,2
holy s these are bad the plastic shell has these small raised diamond nubs that are sharp and when rubbed against your skin will gradually scrape off your skin like a nail file if you carry it vertically via the handle your knuckles will be rubbing against the nail file like material and its super painful samsonite if you are reading this you dun goofed up at least put a protective pad under the handle you imbeciles if you are wearing shorts and carrying this luggage up the stairs say goodbye to your leg skin if you let it touch you im not even exaggerating,0
the turtleneck is not one piece of material it consists of two pieces sown together,1
wellmade product but i was disappointed the the color wasnt a neon bright yellow,1
when i put these on i initially was happy they were very cushioned and soft however as soon as i started walking i realized the toe post on the left shoe is not positioned right forcing the back of my foot off the shoe in other words i could not walk in these i want to order another pair because they did feel good but not sure,0
beautiful dress however it was too small,2
cheap made way smaller than sized,1
they are hardly flared at all so they basically just sit on top of your nose they look really cute but i have to check it all the time to make sure it hasnt fallen out,0
i have only worn them a couple times so far but they fit good and are fairly comfortable i plan to use these for my running shoes so hopefully they hold up,2
nice looking pants fabric was nice but kinda thin almost see thru there is a zipper in the back the pants are made in chinafor girls with flat behinds i would normally wear an xl 1416 i ordered a xxl not even close couldnt get them on had to return and will not reorder shame i liked the looks of them if china wants to sell in the american market they need to do some size research and try to get it right,1
i got the olive green color they are flattering and arent see through they are a very thick material and are very warm i was hoping for a cool comfortable lounging material but these are too thickwarm and clearly for working out im sure the thickness helps make them squat proof,2
this is more of an orange than a maroonpink i returned,1
this dress is nothing short of spectacular it is so well made and the flower detail on the tule makes it so beautiful and elegant it is quite long though so i guess a little alteration is needed,2
tried them on said oh no how can a mans large be too tighti bought them for around the housepockets in back on buttstick outnot shown in pictures but they streched i dont know how a man can wear thesenot at all masculine,1
is a great band but quickly fades because of that not worth the,1
the cut on this is weird the waist is very lowbr br the material seems like it is barely denim really thin if you pull on it just a little bit it will stretch almost like sweatpants,0
ordered 2 xl and it fit like a small,0
this is the second pair of bolles ive purchased for my wife these were a replacement for her first pair that lasted three years and just wanted a new pair without scratches that occurred because of everyday use,2
model is so deceptive the material is super cheap and costumey for use of a better word it came very wrinkled as well and the tail did not flow like on the model at all the concept of the shirt is great poor execution,0
so much fun to wear to the games with my sons on it,2
this bra runs very small under the breastsbr i am a size 68 and usually fit in a l bra i bought an xl and its too tight very uncomfortable,0
far better appearance than quality,0
these were ordered for my granddaughter they fit perfect and she loved them,2
never thought id ever own birks but 5 weeks into moving to co i decided that i needed these and now i wear them all the time extremely comfortable and the styling is cute i receive compliments on them all the time they do dye the bottoms of my feet so im hoping theyll hurry up and stop that,2
size was way to small to ware i could not pull them over my butt,0
a bit long but nice fit adds q bit of dressed to comfort,2
my husband said it ran smaller than most other shirts he has but he loves the style,2
i bought this as a gift one in gold and two in silver xmas gifts for my mother and grandmother its pretty the chain seems durable but theyll never be able to read what it says im still going to give it to them but im not happy with it,0
i like a smaller bike chain as opposed to big heavy bulky ones this is the perfect sizebr unique nontraditional design,2
the print and colors are vibrant and adorable but i doubt ill be using this as an actual apron the material is thin and seems to be cut smallish for a unisex size it looks and feels as though it would not wear well or last long for actual cooking use and getting dirty id be afraid to put it in washing machine overall fun to look at but not practical for its intended use,0
i liked it it fitsbr br but i did not realize it was so silky i dont like silky clothes but thats okay as long as it fits for the party im going tobr br also did not realize you can see through the fabric so im going to have to buy probably kind of white blouse under it,2
overalls fine,1
washes well and fits well,2
i have had one of these for many years and my unit is still going extra points for having something so portable that can do boots and gloves it is great for skiing as it is compact and fits well in my bag blows gentle warm air it sounds like a hairdryer but doesnt warm up as much only difficulty i have with mine is that my glove extensions dont lock in the extended position so when i put the gloves on they often retract i would get another one when the time comes have not seen anything else as portable that does boots and gloves at the same time,2
these were perfect for my son he wore them to my wedding,2
from bellroys ads i thought i would end up with a superthin wallet the high price suggested that it might be magic however it wasnt magic nice wallet but no thinner than the one i already had i returned it and got my money back,1
it says tshirt but it is very thin not great it also runs small,0
these shirts hold all the sweat while working out they are like sponges that i can literally wring out when done working out the white shirt becomes seethrough visible matted chest hair and nipples is not going to work in public the gray also becomes pretty unsightly when soaked with sweat ive never experienced this with other sweat wicking shirts no way to call these quick dry they take days to dry out,1
a little over priced for what it is,1
love these socks a little pricey otherwise no problem,2
the dress looks amazing fits like a glove when you order the proper size shows off your figure well perfect for a hourglass figure,2
it was not as pictured had a different neckline very cheaply made poor quality,0
cute set of fashion jewelry,1
decent jacket fitting was a bit smaller than expected quality is decent,1
i wish the reviews about the top being very big were closer to the top of this item there is nothing wrong with the dress the material is good it is merely designed for a bustier woman a much bustier woman i wear an a so i didnt have a chanceit does run true to size other than that if you wear smaller than a 4 a small will be too big needed to return,1
good quality very much as pictured,2
while this flower was very beautiful and specific to my sisters birth month i really wanted it daintier the necklace is larger than expected with the chain thicker as well the design makes up for it though with a beautiful pearl color with gold birth flower,2
this definitely wasnt as fitted as i had expected but i am a huge fan of corset belts so that solved that problem real fastbr br fits true to size and is stretchy possibly runs large since from the photos it looks like its meant ro be more fittedbr br the material is fairly thick and not itchy or uncomfortable so seems pretty good quality and again has a great stretch to itbr br longer than i thought as well goes almost to my knees and im quite tallbr br overall really its good quality looks cute and is pretty comfortable so i would say a good value for the cost and super cute for fall weather,2
malisimo,0
this wallet is very cute and exactly what i was looking for style wise with the cute owls fyi the money part of the wallet does not fit bills and there is no zipped coin pouch for loose change i have to fold the bills in half to make them fit in the zipped cash part just a heads up if you always carry cash and coins i will most likely use it as a spare,1
absolutely adorbs,2
so i love the style and the basic fit but the drawstrings dont actually tighten much the just lace and hold so if you want the extra tight feel for security when jumping into waves or diving you might worry about losing your shorts,1
colors were like the picture nice tie,2
looks nothing like the actual dress i use it to sleep because i wouldnt wear that out in public,0
i sent these back there was a very very strong smell of chemical,0
the material and the shirt itself are fine but it does not stay buttoned i found myself buttoning my shirt all day long it fits just fine actually its a little loose but the buttons and fabric are poor quality wouldnt recommend,0
so the red is not the red pictured above it is more of a bright fire engine red not the cranberry pictured above i feel like it is a bit fitted around the bootie and would prefer for it to be looser a bit too short for a curvy girl to wear with leggings in my opinion,1
these are great for being outdoors hiking or fishing or whatever especially early in the morning when it is a bit cold easy to take on and off i will also use one on top of my head to keep from getting sunburn through the openings on my bike helmut i have given a couple away and my friends also like them,2
bought the xl fits size range 1014 because womens sizing across brands is insanely inaccurate love these wash delicate cycle is best but do not dry in dryer let hang dry theyll last longer,2
i loved these and dont have any complaints really the braided strap wasnt far enough back my little toe kept coming out of the side i cant stand the way that felt i gave em to my sister she likes em,1
wasnt as big as i thought,1
these glasses broke within a week of wearing them,0
purchased for my daughter she loved it fit as expected wears and cleans nicely,2
im 6 foot and just a touch on the short side not bad though pockets arent too deep seems like phone slides out easily,1
very cute and well made these arrived much faster than expected,2
looks nice and fits perfect but the quality of the fabric got ruined after a single wash somehow disappointing,1
jerzees are a little more fitted than i like but the product looks sturdy is lightweight and washes well,1
it is just like normal glasses,2
i received this dress with a hole in the pocket the fabric is thinner than expected ok buy for the price,0
my girlfriend gets compliments all the time she says its cool not clingy and 34just perfect34,2
i loved the color but this shirt was very small and thin material,1
ooo lalaaaa im a big girl and this made me super confident and fit great size up like 2 sizes though,2
very cute but a bit see through and it fits like a junior size with a 46 so sending back,1
a very comfortable soft shirt i was unsure about a polo without buttons but took a chance on this one the neckline is high enough that the lack of buttons doesnt matterbr br ive washed the shirt a couple times its colorfast and comes out of the dryer wrinkle freebr br the size was perfect even after washing no shrinkage,2
it is poor quality not functional if you want it for a halloween costume it would be fine but otherwise dont buy it,0
the fit of the shirt is generally good save slightly narrow shoulders the material however is just about the oddest ive ever seen a shirt made out of its very much like a white canvas bag was made into and shirt and as such is fairly rough and inflexible if you arent totally comfortable in dress shirts to begin with this shirt defiantly isnt for you,1
this was such a disappointment instead of being soft and flowing the fabrics was stiff and didnt hang right yuck all the way,0
very comfortable i had some confusion if seams should be worn out or in since there were tags sown on both sides either way looks wrong so i had to stop wearing it in public,1
looks okay would be better if it came in a box,1
it was too sheer to wear all by itself even with the layers of tule not as fluffy as appears and longer but i did like the length when it was on her,0
these are cute but some of one of the reindeers was not painted,1
very disappointed because ive been looking for everyday long sleeve shirts to wear this winter and when these arrived i saw that they look and feel like pajama tops if i were to wear them outside people would think im walking around with pajamas on i purchased 3 sent 2 back and kept one for a pajama top i will continue my search for long sleeve comfy shirts also i wear medium to large depending on the top i ordered large for a more roomy feel but the large was not as large as one would expect the fit is not too small but a bit on the small side for a large,0
if it had fit better i would have kept it it was tight on butt and big around legs didnt like the fit on me but of looser on butt would have liked it,0
i have had this wallet for a couple of weeks now it is designed to be a front pocket carry wallet but i carry it in my rear pocket and it works great i dont even know it is there most of the time i am able to carry 78 cards and some cash in it when it was new sliding cards inout was very very tight after a couple of weeks using it its starting to loosen up still tight but improving i really like the clear plastic id panel so you dont have to always remove your id when asked for it time will tell how well it will hold up but it appears to be decently made,2
very cheap looking,0
i absolutely love these pants i recently lost weight and am in need of new clothes i saw these and read the reviews and decided to take the risk and get the size 4 crossing my fingers they got delivered a bit late due to bad weather but i received notifications the whole time and i was kept up to date when i took them out of the bag and saw that they looked small i was really disappointed i thought for sure they wouldnt even go above my hips however to my surprise not only did they go beyond my hips but they buttoned up nicely the fabric is very comfortable and stretchy i didnt even have to shorten them i am very happy with this purchase,2
ordered 3 amazing quality and price,2
liked the feel of it,2
looks nothing like the pictures fit is so bad very loose and way longer than pictures quality sucks,0
well dosent light up not sure if i wanna reorder or get something else,0
do not order by the size chart i wear between a five and six american so i ordered a medium nope no no no order a size smaller,2
its a good sweater its nice fits good size down i purchased the small im 155 lbs its not itchy as described by other reviewers i ironed it inside out because it came a little wrinkled its not a thin sweater and its not a thick sweater its in between my only real issue is that the sleeves on the shoulder the stitching is a little lower than what it should be check out the pictures i am keeping it because i like the color and i need a sweater,1
comfortable and not bad for the price,1
the gloves were not as warm as expected also a little too large which made texting impossible,1
im size 6 and i had to order size 5 they did fit length wise but were too narrow also they made squeaky annoying noises when walking,0
im 51 and orders xs i still had to tailor it,1
34s are too small and 36 is too large i guess i needed a 35 other than that i like the pants,2
they look great but they broke really easily,1
not flattering,0
these fall down a lot even though theyre tight maybe its my muffin tops fault,1
i guess this kit would have been a good investment if it had been shipped with a manual of sorts im a total novice and i need step by step instruction,0
great pair of furry slippers fits to size although they are obviously bigger than your feet on the outside great fun,2
super cute and super small but totally retro awesome earrings for an great price super cute for clubs and parties i try to wear them as much as possible,1
love these for spring,2
just ok hat is huge and completely wrinkled up other items good,1
runs way to small,0
these are too small and break easily,0
the color is great but the wallet is too flimsy for my liking would not buy again delivery was great,1
not true to the size ordered 2 different sizes and neither fit,0
its a very nice apron and very well sewn but unfortunately m size is a little bit too small for me and i am a thin person if there was a l size it would have been perfect,1
no problems with it,2
they seem to be working well with gloves extremely comfortable,2
sizing is completely off,0
very nice chain for the price,2
i ordered this item but it does not look like what is in the picture,0
not much value as a windbreaker or for insulation think twice before ordering this,1
i love these shirts and now have 3 of them and hope to buy more but i wanted to write a review for the tiedye one because i had to return it first it is not as soft as the others assuming because it is dyed second it is actually smaller than the regular ones so i if you are like me and have a little extra around your stomach order a size upbr br but since it is not as soft i do not plan to reorder the tiedye one which makes me sad i really wanted it idk,1
the product came on time and looks great it just fits a little close so you cant wear thicker socks with them other than that happy with the shoe its goes perfect with all the outfits that i brought them for my daughter is happy,1
fish was too big for chain n chain was very poorly made mine came in all knotted,0
i took a chance on this bc of the pretty pattern but honestly i would not purchase it againbr br prosbr it fits as expected yay and covers the area under your armpits the length is great for a plus sized woman who likes to fully cover the belly and backside areabr br consbr the fabric has a weighted feel which sucks in the summer heat it is heavy and thick not cool and lightweight the bottom of the top is not hemmed so it looks unfinished and cheap the straps are not adjustable this wasnt much of an issue due to the appropriate fit but it may bother someone who needs to adjust the strapsbr br if you want a thicker tank with an unhemmed finish this is the shirt for you if you want a lightweight summer top with soft fabric keep looking,0
loved this pattern and neckline so much but it isnt meant for small chested or small booty women you need a good set of hips and c cups to fill out a small i am 51 and 105 lbs and couldnt fill it out in all the right places fit my friend like a glove though and she looked fantastic in it and received many compliments when she wore to a bridal shower she is short like me but has shapelier thighs and a larger cup size than i do,1
not too badive had better ones,1
if you have a lot of hair and want it completely covered this not the best option for you,1
the catch is so loose that i list the pin the second day i wore it,0
love them,2
awesome tight lacing corset simple but effective and durable be sure to break it in properly,2
beautiful color and comfortable,2
these bands do their job keeping the sweat from your head and forehead to drop all the way into your eyes they are light and keep you cool yet are very absorbent also you can play with its width you can narrow it down or widen it up as you see fit didnt use to hold my hair up so cant comment on thatbr br the only problem i have is that it can be really tight at the beginning but it will improve as you wear it,2
made with cheap fabric and sizing was off too tight at the burstline,0
its ok,1
everyone seems to like the riding top it is way too thin for me also my phone iphone14 max is too large for the pockets the fit is ok im 56 135 lbs 39 chest and 32 waist i bought a medium the chest shoulders waist and sleeves fit fine the length is too long by about 5 inches,1
i got this for my grand daughter to use under her dress for her school formal you get the choice of nipple covers or silicone bra depending on your clothing item it sticks on very well it is very easy to put on and take off it has a front clasp to gve a nice cleavage look once you have them on it fit really well they are very well made and a very nice quality,2
the shirt is nice material is nice fits a little big but thats ok the only thing is it is hard to get the wrinkles out whats up with that i bought 2 and its the same in both maybe i need to use a hotter setting on the iron,1
i like the thicknesssoftness very comfortable top,2
i ordered a couple of different styles in the same sizes and all hanes but i had to return these as they were smaller than expected otherwise they seemed acceptable,1
the fabric is nothing like youd expect its definitely not a baggy crew neck sweatshirt like youd expect its made of a spandex material has a slight turtle neck collar also the sleeves are about 34 the length of my arms very ugly would not waste your money,0
theyre rainbow underwear what more do you want i will suggest ordering down a size im usually a large in most things but in these im a medium my pant size varies between 32 and 34,2
so glad i got this cute little jacket it is warm soft and has plenty of room to move it is now my go to jacket i just love it,2
very thin hard to remove odors from,0
i like amazon esentials better,2
it was too big could have went down a size and i didnt like was how wide the top was too much space,0
terrific hat great sun coverage and stylish to boot,2
just turns lights yellow,2
i love the pockets on these leggings i bought 2 pairs and wore them on vacation they were comfy and i always had my phone in the convenient pocket,2
very good fit good material not see through high waist very sexy outfit with enough coveragebr reference i ordered m im 138 411,2
the stone is way bigger than expected and it snags in everything i have only had it in for one night and i hate it,0
my son really loves this however i cannot seem to get an odd 34bleach34 smell out of it i wash it but the smell is back by the next morning,0
i wear it all the time,2
not true to size you need to order a size bigger,0
great design but the sizing is terrible barely fits my 8 year old who had a small head would probably work best on a child aged 56,0
there were supposed to be 2 in the package but there was only 1,0
not waterproof at all stepped in a small area of melting iceslush not even a full puddle and toes instantly became wet and cold they also arrived looking already worn dirty scuffs and what appears to be dried mud on them they appear nice and flattering in stock photos but upon putting them on i quickly learned that they do not fit as described super wide and do not even align properly when laced to comfortable tighten level if i wasnt out in the middle of no where i would be returning asap now im just stuck wearing my old pair that are worn nearly useless for the next 2 months,0
i wear large this shirt fits perfectly slightly clingybr keeps me cool while ridingbr full zipper is nicebr colors are vibrant has held up well in the washbr tackyelastic hem ends on sleeves and trunk are nicebr br i bought the flying tiger design as it stands out on the road,2
,2
great jacket just make sure you order 1 size larger all hh is top quality i highly recommend their products,2
fits ok had to add rolled felt inside to make it small enough and then the height is a little short fine for a rarely used costume fine for the price,2
its okay,0
cheap and flimsy,1
snatched waist and lifted girls personally i dont like the thong back but some people are into that i didnt pay attention to that when i bought it,2
the neckline is not as oversized or vd as the picture shows and it fits tighter with shorter sleeves than pictured,1
kids love them,2
not a fan of the material it looks super cheap up close but the shirt is cute so i kept it and just wear a shacket with it,1
not a great fit they tend to slide off and not stay in place,1
the shoe is really cute but the quality was awful these are supposed to be clear jellies with bits of glitter inbedded the jelly plastic is flawed and cloudy in many places and i could not even wear these shoes i guess you get what you pay for,0
some of them didnt work and i had to order another batch so i could put more in the goodie bags,1
nice white elephant gift,2
garbagebr too small looks very cheap once washed fabric pills dont waste your,0
i wore the shirt once the material is odd and the sleeves were too wide ended up donating,0
so i was an idiot and ordered the wrong size of these i saw the medium in the title and instead of thinking that was the color thought it was the size yes yes i know the size is in the title too was looking at a small screen and just didnt see itbr br so imagine my surprise when i decided to try them on anyway and they fit aside from being a little loose in the belly band they actually fit smoothly over the rest of my body since this is a few sizes up from my normal that was very surprising especially because they were snug in the calves granted this is stretchy material so it may be appropriate for someone who normally wears a size 1x to still be ok with this sizing i think some caution should be followedbr br i really do like the design of them i think the detail at the bottom is cute and the color was a nice color to have aside from the normal black leggings that every workout pair seems to be ill be continuing to wear them since they fit just finebr br they stood up in the wash well and had no fraying or other defects washing did not appear to shrink them any either nice leggings but please take caution when looking at sizebr br review by m reynard 2019,1
super cute perfect gift for girls who love cheerleading,2
sizes are incorrect this was way too small,0
its cute doesnt have a lot of space for change and it doesnt hole my phone its just cute,1
i purchased this tank top to workout in i love the colour and its light weight i got another one in a different colour only time will tell if the material will fare well with wash,2
wanted something for my flight to vegas and this bag worked great plenty of space and easy to carry,2
the zipper gets stuck a lot and there isnt much room for cash,1
necklace came with a broken clasp i havent received a replacement yet the medal looked fine but the chain couldt be opened to put on,1
loved the look and sleeves of this top but it was very see through also a little short cropped not really like the picture returned it,0
wife of account holderbr br i recommend ordering 2 sizes up im a 5347 curvy girl with a lot of junk in the trunk i wear a size xl in bottoms and l in tops so i was in between what size to get i went with my motto of always ordering bigger just in case so i ordered the xl and it fits just like a l im working out right now and am losing weight so im sure itll fit better in a few months overall its great quality super cute and showcases my curves and thigh perfectlybr br i highly recommended please note this review is based off of a discounted review sample from the vendor if you think this review was helpful id greatly appreciate your feedback support by clicking on the 34yes34 button below thanks,2
cute bra but had to return because the medium felt like boa constrictor around my rib cage 36 a size guide a bit off runs small,1
returning it way way too small size did not fit and it smells awfullike moldlike its been in the basement for too long ive tried to like it but it stinks,0
i love this style they look so cute,2
are usually wear a large and this was a little too tight in the bust and im not a big busted at all had to return,0
soft material color as i expected just run a little large,2
they werent the right size for my watch so i had to return them,0
waste of my money,0
too bulky for what i needed it for,1
given as gift to young teenvery pretty happy with purchase,2
good hat just too stiff,1
this product worth not more than 12 for its quality its priced doubled and not that much great product,0
after a couple months of wear three stones have already fallen out i always remove my rings when i wash my hands so this is from just wearing the ring the band isnt as substantial as the photo makes it appear its very thin and flimsy looking,0
on the one hand this unit does blow warm air and is quiet so thats good on the other hand it lacks an autooff timer which means that you have to remember to go back and turn it off or it will run indefinitely imo an autooff feature is basic and should have been included on a boot dryer as expensive as this one 45 thermic does include a timer on their even more expensive model but that unit is 80 and has a silly uv sterilization feature,0
dress is clingy and not flattering at all i sized up just in case not for me,1
you get what you pay for its cheap and looks it its too large and its foggy very obviously fake even for a replacement while mine was being repaired it was too obvious,0
awesome,2
been 40yrs or more since i had a speidel twist o flex have just had clone twist o flex from walmart those clones held up well esp since im in maintenance with welding grinding shock etc i have had this band 2 months and one of the outer link covers is missing i am not allowed to wear watch at present employer and ive been removing it at home in the shop so its been pampered i going to try one again walmart doesnt have jewlery counter any more and there shelf selection minimal thats why ive looked here i love these type bands because they come off if caught in machinery,0
i wanted to love this dress but it was awful reminded me of a dress that could come out of a childrens dress up kit super cheap material and too vivid colors,0
videoidedef21c5b245e21b85ce89cf4efdc0f6 i love the style but it scratches easily and is huge,1
very pleased with the quality we looked all over local stores to find a tan casual suit ordering on amazon was easy and the price was good for how nice the suit looks,2
purchased as a gift very nice,2
made cheap,1
these were nice leggings and were long enough for me since i am between a regular and a tall when it comes to length however i tried these on with whitelight underwear underneath and you could tell so these are going back need something a little bit thicker than this,1
the color is more muted then shown runs a touch large,1
i would recommend buying one size largerbr but i do not like tighter fitting clothesbr could be personal preference,1
the metallic ornament on one side of each bracelet fell off and broke before we got it out of the box good,0
just perfect,2
doesnt fit right and uncomfortable,0
esta mal echa le falta mucha piedreria intente sacarle foto pero no pude aganlas bien,0
is exactly as shown written this is 10m diameter ill be buying the gold colored as well,2
its a cute cuff but i could not sleep in it the points are so sharp for the time it took to get in my ear it wasnt worth taking it in and out to sleep,1
its great and i love it a lot but you definitely cannot wear it for longer than an hour at a time,1
these shoes are very stiff hard not comfortable at all ive added fleece insoles which helps but i think ill give them away,0
the picture showed a definite blue belt but it is not it is not as well made as other stretch belts i have purchased will see how it wears,1
romantic numbers and keeps time perfectly,2
great sleep dress but also cute for running to market in or over a bathing suit,2
great materials better than i thought it would be,2
just ok look like their price,1
it doesnt hold its shape around the arms and collar area dont dry it on warm,1
ive purchased a lot of this type of bag for my purses and this is the worse one ive bought right out of the box the zipper was stuck in the middle of the bag and theres no pull tab on the other zipper i found part of it on the floor if this was expensive it would have went back debra h,0
just as described,2
i really liked the necklace until it turned my neck green,1
nice but not for a person with a high arch,1
im 59 wear 810 pants typically its often a struggle to choose between medium and large when shopping online i bought these in medium and they fit nicely just dont put these pjs in the dryer lesson learned the hard way when my pj pants turned into pj capris i stuck them back in the washer then stretched them back to pant length again it worked out these are definitely adorable and comfortable too,2
like them but not sure what color they are they look like a beige brown to me but the description characterized them as pink very comfortable,1
excellent and elegant i simply love it,2
im very disappointed in the quality control im missing a button and the other buttons all required sewing,1
it is misspelled dude is oude lame,0
best style of boxer ive ever found and worn the waistband with no tag is where its at,2
i go the size based on the comments and the top portion was too large for me,1
i ordered these compression pants for my husband he uses them when he plays basketball he really liked these because they are lightweight comfortable ideal thickness and a good fit please make note that the chinese size chart runs a little smaller than the us size chart my husband who wears a large in us sizes ordered the largest size available an xlarge and the pants fit him perfectly i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest assessment this review is based on my own experiences with the product if you have found this review and to be helpful to you please indicate that with the helpful button below your feedback is always appreciated thank you for taking the time out to read my review in its entirety,2
comfort,2
this is like the best watch for use when you are being more rough and adventurous than normal,2
these are decent tank tops a little on the thinner side overall happy with the tanks but i think they should be priced much lower not worth 30 in my opinion should be more around 20 if that,1
initial very small and dainty my girls loved them,2
very long for my short 51 self have to wear heels with it cant really wear bra back comes down low but i have hiked the back up to wear a strapless bra love how it ruffles in stomach area and is not skin tight there but is everywhere else sexy recommended but get 1 size up,1
my sons loved it wish i could order more,2
very cute just a little big my granddaughter is between sizes sobr hopefully will fit by spring,2
at 1st i didnt get my 2 orders but i contacted the seller and they sent out my replacement masks right away and i got them about 2 weeks later i love these masks because they are comfy and have the metal nose strip too so it was ok that they came late thank you for fixing my issue right away i will order from here again because of the customer service,1
these sneakers do not use breathable material and last only a few weeks i would spend more next time and get better quality breathable sneakers,1
not what i expected this shirt is soooo small for an example the gray sweater in the photo is a small and the shirt i ordered is a medium i hate doing returns,0
it is so soft and very nice looking but the sleeve split in half the first day i wore it to work,0
definitely too big,0
they were nice and soft and smoothe and very comfortable to wear but without even washing them and after wearing only several times they began to pill to the point that they were no longer nice to look atbr br they ended up tucked away with little usebr br i wouldnt recommend these if you need them to look neat and presentablebr br if you dont care about pilled wool then they are quite comfortablebr br however id rather have both the comfort and the quality which should be possiblebr br i have many merino wool garments that wash and wear beautifully,1
this is about two sizes two small i have lost weight so it fits now got a large and i am 5346 200 but rather bottom heavy than top,1
first of all after following the wash and dry recommendations they shrunk secondly the waist tie came out in the dryerbr going to donate to viet vets and eat the loss,0
i was hesitant to buy underwear on line but no problems with these the size chart was accurate and they are very comfortablenot too skimpy and they dont ride i wasnt sure what the colors would be but they are totally acceptable with one each white blue beige and pink cant beat the price either,2
the item arrived as promised fortunately because it arrived on the birthday of the recipient it worked once i installed batteries the problem i had with this item was that the package was torn and looked like it had been used and returned because this was a gift for a child and i would not be able to get another one in time to wrap him a new gift for his birthday i kept it but was disappointed in the shape it arrived the 2 stars were because 1 it arrived on the correct day and 2 it worked,0
good fit good price,2
watch appears to be poorly finished i own three other invicta pro divers and they are nothign like the one advertised here higher quality fit and finish,0
these worked well for halloween but were much lower cut than i anticipated i wore spanx over them to keep them up they dont stay in place that well,1
the rose is extremely cheap looking sometime you get a bargain and sometime not this is a not will put this out in a yard sale received on time,0
it was a gift for my brother he loved it it came in a box well packed,2
perfectlove them,0
beautiful print made good just a tad small all his shirts are large so anyways if i buy from you again ill do an xlarge,2
this product deteriorated very quickly,1
fit was off too big and printing was poor,0
one hat looked fine the green one had a noticeable hole near top not wearable could be poor knitting snagged during production or mothrodent action yuck they both were flimsythin worth it to buy better beanie hats elsewherebr br note we were not compensated for this unbiased review and no one should be,0
i got the smallest size available 610 and they just barely fit my size 85 womens feet will update review when i have worn them more,1
these are really useful for attaching other items to your carry on for walking around the airport i always have my purse or a backpack along with my luggage i can use this to tightly secure everything,2
im not sure why we cant standardize womens sizing in the us but it seems we cantbr br i ordered my true size usually my size these almost fit but theyre too loose and too long im not tall so thats a hard thing to manage but the 934 inseam seemed to hang low and the shorts were longer than expected im 5434 and these fall just above my knee an unflattering lengthbr br 34standardized34 sizing usually means everythings loose in the waist its nice when theres a draw string to massage the fit on these pants the thing that looks like a draw string isnt its just a tie you cant cinch these in at all there is a velcro flap that allows you to let it out though so the thing that fits too loosely to start with leaves you lots of room to grow nice,1
thin material i thought the coat was thicker,1
shrank more than i expected,1
my husband has so many bracelets this works great for him to display and find exactly what he wants,2
purchased for a party so they will do the trick if you have short fingers and small hands the tips of gloves may b a little long but they are fine for my purposes and they extend a little above elbows also a cute little hair tie was included as a little xtra,1
they work and wash well,2
product isnt anything like the photos they are 95 cotton and shrink,0
not as bright as the color as in the photo kinda washed out but soft and will work,1
took a long time to arrive but i got them and they are great for cycling and running,2
ok these are super cute the uniqueness is awesome soft adorable true to size unique,2
the insole and sole of these shoes are fantastic like putting your foot in your favorite slippers but better i would give them ten stars the fit of the shoe is awful there is plenty of room in the toe area but the heels are way too wide and flop on and off of the foot while being worn which i find extremely annoying i have tried everything to get these shoes to fit better and nothing works ive added extra insoles mini foot socks and waited for warmer weather in the hope that my feet would swell a little and take up the extra space but they are still a huge disappointment and will go to the donation pile there also doesnt seem to be consistency in the sizing of this brand of shoe they need to be tried on because one size in one style doesnt mean you would wear the same size in another style,0
ive only worn it a few times and it just broke im not happy it was a cute band but doesnt last long at all,1
these shoes shrunk in size when left out in sun,0
i was so disappointed in the last two i bought i initially bought 3 and they were perfect i decided to purchase the exact same exact style and size shirt just different colors and these were comically huge i have 34 extra inches of material around my upper arms and the sleeves are so long i have to fold them 3 times to get to my wrists,0
low grade material ran at least 23 sizes to small,0
these are great wire rimmed glasses i bought these old fashion readers to be in a play its a wonderful life and they worked out perfectly grand for the price i paid these readers are vintage adorable and very comfortable to wear,2
i couldve saved myself some time if i wouldve read the reviews before purchasing this grill cover is not orange it is black with an orange t i am keeping it just so i dont have to go through the hassle of returning and getting the same cover again like others before me i dont like the look of the black as much as the orange but it is a gift and im sure my dad will like it just fine just beware that you will get a black one instead of an orange one,1
great quality,2
so after seeing all the bad reviews i was prepared for the worst but was hoping for the best when i opened the package a strong odor came out but dissipated quickly the first impression was that the fabric was soft and light but very wrinkled after putting it on i do agree with others that the v part doesnt close enough it does have one eye hook on it to help keep it closed but its not enough also the hole in the dress that allows the tie to goe around the waist is way too large when i put it on i could see flesh i havent decided if i will keep it or return if i keep it i will need a slip and maybe do some surgery to close up the hole i would not recommend this to anyone,0
too thin,1
starting with the good design and bells of the shiny reindeer was cute but very thin material and seemed stretched out almost like a very old sweater gets in the neck and sleeves will include a photo if that helps i ordered in both black and red but both had the same issue large seemed almost too large and i would typically go size 1214 for a loose top,0
price was excellent fore the value,2
ok socks some have holes after a few months especially on the sides of your heels,1
i had to return these pretty pink shoes because they are very wide,1
i like the style but fits rather tight i would go a half size larger than your normal size i will purchase this product again but will follow my own advice,1
very sad these shoes were the best however they are now cheaply made and not worth the price they no longer are true to size also they have removed the heel backing which causes the heel to collapse when you try to put them on even with a shoe horn or shoe tool it is awful trying to put them on will not spend money on these again,0
is the width 2534 or 4234 conflicting info in description looks like 4234,1
the stripes on the one i received were pretty awful they were crooked the white is pretty sheer as well its a cheap dress so wasnt expecting a lot but couldnt live with the crooked front stripes on this one returned it i did have a friend who ordered one and hers was okay so probably a hit and miss thing,0
a little flimsy but all in all good deal for the price,2
purchased a large but fit like a xl overall comfortable,1
the sizing is cut way bigger than expected and the material is way thinner than i thought it would be,0
very scratchy,0
chamois is good not to thick i ordered xl just like with other bike shorts and the fit was correct these are a good quality short,2
im on the hunt for perfect undies for a middleaged not so small woman who doesnt want to feel like a total frump these are ok but i find the waistband curls a bit and the waist is a tad too high for me theyre ok,1
love it,2
good product for the,1
i think it would be better if it was 24 but it does what it should do,1
i love these pants will definately buy more in other colors they fit well move well and are just the right thickness i didnt even have to hem them for my 53 stature,2
the dress seem to be stright cut and not as curvy as the picture it does not not run small therefore buy your size brought a bigger size thinking it would fit because of all the reviews and its a bit big,0
i wear perscription eyeglasses thats why i bought these overglasses these are smaller than any of the glasses i have ever worn,0
was having a hard time finding a boot with the right width and fit that would work with my flat feet these fit perfectly very comfortable well made boot will keep your feet warm and dry in inclement weather well worth the money,2
good cotten does not shrink when washed once again cheap crap,0
im not sure why its so hard to find gloves that fit these i ordered in a size smaller than needed per the chart and they were still way too big expect 12 sizes larger when ordering unless your child has really long fingers,1
poor quality and the material is itchy definitely not recommending this item,0
i am usually quite fond of jewelry from the amazon collection but this particular piece is one that i would not have looked at twice had i seen it in person it is perhaps the only one i have that looks better in the photos than it does on the neck there is no mistaking this as a piece of costume jewelry that is intended to provide a substantial amount of bling however it fails because it looks so cheap the man made white sapphires on the bail of this pendant are perhaps the dullest i have seen in any jewelry the setting is heavy actually heavier than it needs to be but it houses many teeny tiny crystals unfortunately they are also rather dull and appear even more so since the sterling silver is plated in rhodium the focal point large created blue sapphire is hung with the rounded end at the top and the pointed end of the teardrop at the bottom it swings ever so slightly when worn and it is attached precisely as demonstrated in the photo not centered depthwise all in all the design doesnt work for me the crystals are not beautiful and the general impression is less than glowing,1
these are adorable wellies and my daughter loves them however i was disappointed when one of the handles popped off after simply trying them on she still wears them but it takes her a little longer to get that one wellie on than it should,1
this dress is not for a curvy girl pockets make hips stick out not flattering at all the color wasnt quite the same as picture and the material was very thin and cheap returning immediately,0
good,2
they are very cute but they break apart to easy,0
adorable very nice and thick for that fall weather looks just like the picture my son is 1 month and 2 weeks and this fits perfectly,2
tight but warm good second pair of slippers,1
the pants dont fit right and the beads fell off with the first wear,0
my granddaughter has worn this belt like three times and it just broke in two pieces dont waste your money,0
so pretty and dainty,2
beautiful,2
these should be marketed as a lightweight undergarment waistband is an annoyance as it is so thin it rolls over,0
washed once received got out of washer and top of dress was ruined hung to dry tried on and didnt even cover my booty,0
i even ordered a size up but my wife could barely squeeze into these shes not tall and not skinny and ive gotten use to clothes not fitting as expected but ive gotten good at figuring out what will work and what wont i actually ordered my wife numerous pajamas lingerie sets clothes and shoes this christmas and this is the only thing that didnt fit as expectedbr br obviously for the price youre not expecting the best quality product which in general these arent but that would have been fine if the sizing wasnt so far offbr br cant recommend,0
thank you so much this is so beautiful,2
the post on one set has broke off not very happy,0
very nice shoes runs a little bit small very stylish,2
i had high hopes for these sneakers but they are to stiff in the toe area if you already made a decision to buy ugly shoes like these in order to have comfort then you expect them to be 100 comfortable right sorry but these sneakers do not offer comfort at all returned,0
i liked them but only wore them twice and they are falling apart,0
went off reviews and ordered a size bigger it was huge i could have worn a medium,1
i have so much trouble finding high waisted jeans i bought gloria vanderbilt jeans years ago stopped buying them because they lose their shape and are very baggy thought i would buy them again hoping they made them better nope not better wore them 2 hours very very baggy i do not like baggy jeans,0
great pair of jeggings with 4 functional pockets,2
i bought a womans size m and when i opened them they where to small they fit my 6 year old son,0
i like style and heels but they are hard to put on once i get them on i cant zip them up,0
am returning it its not flattering on,0
the plastic is flimsy and the coin needs to be doubled to secure and stay in place,1
love this slim bag my xr in a case fits perfectly i love the clear touch screen side can slide a card or money in the front pocket,2
very cheap material they broke after wearing 2 times as if they were panties hose do not buy them nice aspect but that is all,0
not real goodi attached it to the smallest setting and it was still very large,1
for the price i expected this to be a slimming romper like all other spanx,0
love this sweater true to size but slightly baggier which i like for sweaters it was a hit,2
cheaply made poor quality beads broke and for some reason i thought it was going to be a pair it was only one,0
too large in bodice and hips probably will never wear except at home too big in lower section but i have large breasts so i needed the larger size not a good fit for me,0
exactly as describedcomfy and warm,2
needs constant washingcleaning or it builds up mold or builds up mold on your gearclothing might work better with a giant beach bag,0
i asked my husband to try out this badger smith polka dot print button down shirt he usually likes blue button down shirts but unfortunately did not have a lot of positives to say about this one the first and most troublesome issue is that this size large shirt is cut very small and narrow at the shoulders when worn it looks unflattering if youre considering it youll need at least a full size larger second the white buttons and design accents at the inner cuffs button flap collar and back fabric locker loop are too much of a contrast against the deep blue color of the shirt and ends up looking cartoonish rather then trendy if they simply kept the shirt limited to the subtle polka dots on the blue fabric and cut the shirt larger then this would have been a fairly decent shirt,0
picture is great product not so great,0
this hat wears very well its stylish it fits like a glove and im very happy with my purchase i will purchase another one so i can have more of these hats in my closet,2
not for women with breasts or shoulders cheaply made as well,0
wow this item is horrific i followed the instructions to size up for reference i am typically an xss and thats moreso in juniors sizes i almost always ignore recs to size up which usually serves me well bc even then the allegedly small item is sometimes too big and went with a m to be safe i could not even get them on i have never had a 34medium34 be so tiny it is truly like childrens sizes and yes it is scratchy and borderline seethrough and cheap but its a costume and they are all scratchy and cheap so had they fit i still would have worn them this is the only item i have ever ordered that i will be returning and it leaves me with nothing for halloween,0
cheap textile,0
just as i expected very happy with the shirt,2
seemed smaller than it should be,0
slight discoloration that easily noticed,0
its more a mutated color of plum and brown mixed together not plum as pictured one side of the interior lining was not stitched down i can pull out half of the lining i can deal with the lining but the color was misrepresented sure it was only 1200 but still,1
umm to big for my face and i dont have a small face had it over 5 months still sitting here,0
ok,1
awesome shirtbr material is like a polyester runs on the small side,2
looks nice but the inserts are way to deep was digging to recover credit cards and id,0
love these and ive posted for these bracelets on more then one occasion this was given to my freshman in college who is so unsure on her feet when we saw her at parents weekend and btw she is in college out of state i gave this to her as a reminder she is a fighter capable of chasing her dream bc she is a warriorbr br shes just in the beginning of meetingliving with new friendsroommates and adjusting to college courses she has sent me a half dozen photos of just her wrist showing me she has her warrior armor on everyday no she doesnt want the world to know she is afraid on her feet and she also wants to feel the invisible support from her mama a few states away well this is a perfect way to do just that her and i found a secret message because this is written in morse code perfectbr br these are simple and easy to use with a single hand application slipknot and she told me the only time she takes it off is to shower i highly recommend due to the beads being gold plated versus 14 karat but regardless of the wear of the bracelet i am getting so much more from this than just a little blingbr br these are so great for so many occasions with the choices i am 100 certain you will find one to fit your need overall you cannot go wrong with such a clever and on point bracelet im certain i will be getting more in the future,2
these are extremely comfortable and flattering they have just enough stretch for my pear shape and the rise is just right for my short torso,2
i bought one of these jackets for my daughter the zipper on the pocket is defective and we had to cut the pocket to get her cell phone out this company refuses to stand by their product and has terrible customer service they said they will not replace the jacket 1 because we cut the pocket and 2 because the jacket was manufactured 2 years ago we bought it new 3 months ago nice product but not worth the price if they wont stand by their manufacturing,0
not the greatest quality ok for price,1
twisted alot and did not stay in place,1
it fit a little big but i like to order my clothes a little larger and roomier especially robes and jackets otherwise i love the print pattern and the way it feels a great kimono for the price i will definitely consider ordering from this company again,2
cutie pie,1
very narrow im a woman ordering mens booties so was very surprised at how narrow these were i wear a size 85 in womens and ordered a size 9 in mens i should have had plenty of room to glop around the house husbands size 12s are ok in length for him but are also very narrowbr br i decided to try wearing them a few months to see if they would stretch and they fit better now 1 month later still a bit tight when i wear thick socks so am hoping they will stretch more as time goes on,2
hang dry only i guess these socks shrunk 2 sizes smaller when i put it in the dryer bummer,1
i love the look of these glasses but they are almost unuseable because their is no antiglare coating on the lenses while using the screen reflects so badly its too distracting in almost anything but lowlighting so while using for work i dont get the blue screen fatigue but i get a constant glare from computer screens also they are so shiny that even on camera my coworkers and husband have commented on it multiple times super cute but limited use,0
returned these because they ran way too small an xl fit closer to a medium than anything else,0
beautiful necklace but cheaper quality wore it once and im too afraid itll break if i wear it again,1
these have fit just as expected the tank tops go long enough to cover the entire upper half of my body and then a bit more the fabric is very comfortable on the skin its one of the most comfortable things to wear around the house or at the gym no complaints at all,2
i bought a 14 in another dress and it was smaller then this dress,1
nicely made and so cute my daughter actually likes keeping track of her glasses with this,2
the compartments are to small and it is to short,0
fits good not 100 what i was expecting but very pretty still and mostly comfortable to wear all day more of a structured shape to the bra well see how it holds up,1
first ash reflector strips came off doesnt breath very hot to wear,0
very cute,2
i absolutely love these sunglasses they fit my oversized head look great i had to rebuy a pair when my dogs ate my first pair lol,2
love the fact this has pockets,2
it loos okay the strap feels kind of cheap but oh well 20 i guess its okay,1
if you wash it it will bleed all over everything else in the loadbr this is true for the red and the greenbr it also shrank in the washbr br i like the fit and it is very comfortablebr just wish my clothes were all the colors they started at,1
baffin produces a great warm boot,2
i was expecting it to be more burgundywine color and its definitely more of a dark reddish orange also the stripes down the sleeve are not the same pattern mine has a bunch of orange and black and i wasnt expecting the material to be so thin down the sleeve doesnt hang off my shoulder but i have a big bust and usually those kinds of shirts dont fit the same but i expected that,0
i bought these for all of my travel luggage they are well made and easy to program i recommend them for securing your luggage,2
i have a regular nostril piercing i wanted to switch from a stud to a hoop i ordered an 18g 7mm and it was tiny it definitely didnt fit my nose i didnt even try to put it in so i might try to reorder an 18g 9mm to see if it fits im disappointed,1
it shrank order a size or two up because it shrank on low heat,0
ive been very satisfied with the weight of the material in the tshirts but they run a little large if youre wearing these under a uniform or dress shirt you might enjoy a closer fit with a smaller sizebr at 64 and 240lbs i carry my weight more in my chest and shoulders than at my waist,2
cute shoes but the sole is stiff and causes them to slip in the back probably gets better with wear,1
most comfortable pair of shoes ive ever owned i am a hairdresser who stands all day and these are wonderful my feet are not sore at the end of the day they are also great for when you do a lot of walking i highly recommend these,2
feels thin and hard underfoot would recommend inserts,2
i did not like the polyester feel of this material i was hoping itd be made of a stretch cotton spandex like a tshirt i am between sizes m and l i ordered an xl and it was way too big,1
gave the seller my measurements everything fit but the butt had to alter it which was a pain but it is a beautiful costume also it is lined,1
love this tank the material and fit are great i will be buying it in other colors now,2
cheaply made and cheap material that was slightly itchy on my skin i know fit is baggy but this was huge size small and very unflattering,0
fits nice and is very handy for kayak fishing,2
clarks mens kalden step slipon loafer brown has good structure design and material but they were narrow and long which made them suitable for narrow and long feet rather than short and wide feet they also made squeaking sound on tile when walking which was rather embarrassing for me,0
very high quality hat and stitching color and font exactly as depicted could not be more pleased arrived at the earliest end of the shipping window which i appreciatebr br went with this brand over others that appeared similar and were cheaper but at the end wanted to charge a fortune for shipping and arrived later probably because theyre overseas paid almost the same overall and promptly got a highquality product,2
really cute but do not dry in the dryer i wore it once and washed it and now its way to short,1
looks cheap,0
product has worked 2 days and died,0
very nice warm socks with a soft top for those of us with wide calves,2
pros it doesnt feel fake and its super soft it was package well toobr cons the net is visible which is kind of a bummer and yes the curls gets tangled very easily,1
like this a lot looks very expensive but isnt light weight and has the 925 showing it is silver it looks like the clasp might not last too long though i can always make a new one but i maybe i am w wrong for the price one could always buy two,2
so comfortable to wear i would buy them again,2
i ordered these coastal rose leggings in a large for review they felt super soft and silky when my wife first opened the package the color was gorgeous but this only escalated her disappointment when she put them on they are so thin and sheer you can see every little patch of cellulite along with her underclothes not just the outline mind you but the lace and all and it is not because they are too small or too tight these fit her perfectly with a little excess at the anklebr my wife is 57 and wears a size 8 pant they lacked any real support in either her tummy area or legs on a positive note the seams are well sewn and even when my wife pulled and stretched them before putting them on they bounced right back into shape if only these were made of a betterquality fabric their quality does not at all match their price point way to much for what you receivebr these are not a pair of leggings i would recommend that you wear out of the house nor would my wife wear them for anything but to sleep in and these are definitely not a pair she would order again,1
i love this diamond fyi it is not flat so be careful because it will be a lot more easier for it to get caught on something,2
sent this backit was way to wide but i have a narrow foot color is not like the picture either,1
cautionbr softest seeatshirt ever ownedcute sleeve detail runs a little small thoughbr that was 1st review but after 2 washes now little black balls and pilling everywhere tried tricks and nothing works what a mess too late to return now buyer beware,0
beautiful looking and love the color returned because the zipper opening was so small that you could barely put your hand inside the purse,1
i lost my hair to chemo so i bought these beanies not to be stylish but to keep my head warm in my freezing cold officebr br these do the job they are bigger and dont fit as well are the two types of beanies i bought from amazonbr br the material isnt the softest and after only having them for a month they dont hold up very well washing arent getting any softer and are getting those peeling balls already i wear these during the day in my office because its like 50 degrees in there they definitely keep my head warm but if anyone else had those hot flashes from chemo like i do your head will sweat like crazy in these things when you start to flash i have to wash these babies once a week they arent gonna hold up long and instead of getting softer the peeling from washing are making them more uncomfortable for never before bald head its amazing how sensitive your scalp isbr br personally i would like a more fitted style as they i guess are supposed to look trendy with condom like resevior tip on top but for the purposes i am using them for id rather have a more fitted style that i dont need to fold up over my forehead and earsbr br if you are shopping for bald chemo head beanies here my suggestions from the 3 styles i have purchsed from amazon br br 1 these ones you are reading the review for are thebr heaviest type beanie of the 3 styles i purchased they have a scrunched outer material texture and fleece like inner material that has that condom resevior tip design i wear them in my freezing office they are bulky and not attractive nor is the fleece a good soft quality but they do the job with warmth in my opinion these make you look like a chemo patient though because they are bigger and bulkier and even when i roll them up off my ears and forehead they fall down a little bit over what little eyebrows i have left and i dont like that because they have different material on the inside as the outside if you roll them up it looks weird but i dont like that resevior tip thing hanging off the back of my head and if you dont roll them tightly to your head they dont stay on as well but very good choice for cold offices or if you live in a cold area in in san diego so i dont need these outside of my office best for cold temps could wear outside of work to go out because they have a cute subtle scrunched design on outside i bought these on amazon for 15 for a two packbr br 2 a lighter weight kinda fitted cotton simple beanie these i wear at night to keep my head warm the material is the same inside and out so thats better than the beanie with the two typess,1
after i switched the cc3 setter from 95 to size 10 i found the size 10 even fitted much better snugly fit highly recommend i am happy all around,2
great handband and nice quality product as youd expect from nb,2
pros the color and appearance are as advertisedbr cons i seriously believe that the manufacturer forgot to add the memory foam layer or the layer is too thin to even merit a mention out of the box i feel like im walking on lightly padded cardboard also im finding the synthetic liner is quite slippery if paired with socks i have to walk very intentionally in order to keep the slippers from slipping off my feetbr br i will keep the slippers as i only wear them for short durations but i have to admit that i expected better,1
its his favorite color and he loves it its comfortable to,2
im relatively new to skirted leggings but these fit me well i ordered the xl and both the skirt and leggings were fitted but not snug the material is comfortable as it stretches but is breathable i am looking forward to using these in warmer weather,1
too small for man,0
fast shipping amazing seller a best price easy payment item works,2
was way overpriced for the quality no returns,0
pretty runs small,1
size 709 inheight x 984 inwidth x 433 indepth height for strap drops max 244 in min 216 in product net weight 081 lbbr two exterior pockets one on each side with magnet closurebr interior 6 card slots 1 pocket 3 expanding dividers 1 zipper pocket in the middlebr a perfectly functional minimalist pocketbook i couldnt ask for a more sensible purse the neutral color goes with most attire i think it is gift worthy,2
this dress would be greatbut for some reason they chose to line the tan tulle with stars with a pink lining i very visible pink ruins the whole dress sending back very disappointed,0
im tall and was very excited to find highwasted tights specific to riding as i ride in cheap kohl orbr target tights all the time while these tights are very comfortable and more heavy duty than mybr other tights they dont stay up i bought a large i weigh 185 lbs and im 61 so i doubt the size is an issue they continually slide down and im constantly pulling them up also the crotch needs additional padding i dont think i could ride for more than a couple of hours without being sore bummer no way to contact manufacturer and i would not have known there was a problem until i rode in them i do not recommend,0
fits good,2
not true to size at all im normally a size 5 so i purchased a medium thinking it would fit but when i tried on the pants i think even a size small would be to big,0
shirt is huge,1
i dont think its real leatherbr br but looks cool,1
cant expect much for 10 but thought id take a chance if you need to wear a tie and look sharp spend more for a nicer tie clip will be returning,0
love the material i have one very similar to this but its yellow and very old but the snaps on this is not set right their are not sewn in very well plus it is very large on me,1
very see through shorter length than on modek,1
a little thin but love the colour,1
for a medium which states fits 811 they were quite tight i wear a size nine so i expected a bit more room,1
it works best if your hair is down but if your hair is in a pony tail it slips according to my 10yearold daughter that wanted it for basketball games,1
better than many at this price point color in picture is accurate,2
size down otherwise it looks like a parachute also note buyer pays for returns so buy carefully,1
the material is too itchy for my sensitive skin im 57 and 135 i ordered a medium and i could have gone with the small also i should have read the comments to find out the blue jacket is just a design and not actual jacket so thats a little strange too,1
economico pero son para hombre no para mujer pedi 8 y es como 11,0
was to small,0
i did not like how cheap it looks and it looks bulky,0
color slightly lighter than picturedpale blue with a sparkle that knocked my socks off seriously these are faceted in a way that catch the light why one star i looked at the facets with a loop and they are almost the same on each gembr one round is smaller than the otherbr arrived packaged professionally sealed with an additional gift boxbr this is the third time i have order earrings from sellers on amazon and i have gotten two slightly different earrings ie not a pairbr i am finished ordering earrings from amazon,0
product was pretty stiff seemingly due to the stiff plastic seam binding inside this binding could have been done with nylon webbing and been much more pliable ill use it but it is a mediocre replacement to the one i had previously,1
i bought this wig for a quick cosplay and from all the good reviews it was delivered within a week which was nice when i opened it though it was just very thin if i tried it style it in any way it would just show through completely to the wig cap there is so little hair the back is very thin and has very little hair and you can visibly see the inside lining of it when i set it on a wig stand or wear it the front is so long and everything else is just extremely short usually when you life up wig hair you can see the close layers of hair but there was basically about 5 inches between each bundle and its just awful dx not very much hair looks like ill have to get another and sew them together or get a new one all together,1
what i have received looks absolutely nothing like the color as pictured i received 2 pack of some kind of yellow green color cream very disappointed the say the least why posting the wrong color with the correct name written on the container thats definitely misleading,0
it would have been really helpful if they showed this device next to something for scale in the pictures,2
ughthis is ginormous if you want to use as a make shift purse guess again i could almost fit in the bagi also didnt like there was not structure to hold up bag it just fell down or opensending it back color was pretty and it came prompt just way wrong for the way it appears in the photos,1
sooooo so small i usually wear a 4 these i cant get over my thighs,0
its okay chain looks kinda cheap but its cute,1
i just bought these for cold winter weather so i have not worn them yet the size fits with one pair of socks if youre going to wear 2 pair of socks go a 12 size larger the boots have plenty of width i will update my review when ive had an opportunity to wear them in cold wet weather,2
34x i dont think so i ordered the largest size available after reading reviews of this costume on other sites this runs very small im an 18 and this costume in 34x would have been appropriate for a size 12 maybe if youre a size 1012 i know where you can get one of these at a bargain since its still in its bag in my closet and i was unable to return it,0
so soft washes well great nightwear a bit thicker than i expected but that is great,2
i did a lot of looking before i purchased these i was interested in a variety of nose studs with 5mm to 6mm length posts for 16 studs this is a great buy with a bunch of different styles but although theyre advertised as 6mm length they are all different lengths unfortunately i cant wear the longer lengths no matter how cute they are theyre just not comfortable in my small nose boo one of them was broken so lost another star there im guessing that since most of us are comfortable in a specific length if you buy these youll find maybe half will fit properly maybe you can pass some of them along to a friend who can use them the crystals are pretty sparkly,1
very pretty but tears easybr not fir bookbr good for light clothes,0
very disappointed with the fabric in blue 420 the photo looks like the print is blue and gray but actually it is blue and silver sparkle not for me will be returning otherwise the fit and comfort was great,1
sizes are way off and looks alot different then the picture in the picture it shows that the shorts are short and they are pretty long,0
these were way to big for me so i had to return them the material was very thick but also well made,1
its okay i ordered the navy blue dress but was sent a purpleindigo one not to mention my waist is rather high and the dress cinched in about at my hips a little annoying but other than that it fit well the material was comfortable and not itchy like so many other dresses ive had,1
cheaply made,1
way way way too small i ordered a xl and it fit like a legitimate xs its extremely irritating so unless you are tiny i dont recomend this product at all,0
they are very comfy and wash really well even with hang drying they dry quickly i have a very sensitive surgery scar on my abdomen and these do not bother it at all even when wearing to work out they do slide down a little but not in a bothersome way,2
great pendant,2
i ordered a large and it fits like a small,0
this is a super cute sequined jumpsuit the sizing runs smaller than us sizing so refer to the pictures for the sizing information if you order and just order a medium is a 68 the xlarge is 1012 if you are small this is a great jumpsuit to go to clubbing,2
its very pretty but turned my finger green and tarnished after only wearing for a short time,0
waist is extremely big,1
only fits6watches butitsok box,1
i loved this shirt and was excited to get it washed in cold water low heat drier and it still shrunk so much i could wear it my granddaughter just got a new shirt 8,1
great for tablecloths,2
this is a gift for my husband nothing but the best for the finest,2
it was cute fabric was well the armpit area was to big for me because i have petite arms and breasts i am usually a 46 but i would need a much smaller size for this shirt,1
i was given only 3 weeks to return this which was a problem since it was a gift and i had to get it back first to return it the large fits like a xx large my daughter is a size 12 so large would be appropriate but it is way too big my daughters family told her she looked like a bag lady in them they are soft i only wish they fit someone in my familyor that they would exchange them for a medium,0
hat sizing was not accurate i always take a large in hats but a large in this hat this one was way too big also i did not care for the appearance it did not look like the illustration the color was mottled and weathered looking,0
i love this but my gown came with tiny holes in the front by the pleats,1
these hold up really well ive had several pairs over the years i wear them daily,2
great watch for regular days,2
the bill of this is smaller than what i was expecting not a lot of coverage,1
not really what i was expecting while i can appreciate keeping a stones individuality intact mine came with a lump of stillbite poking out the side like a big tumor fortunately i could just pop it off but i thought id be getting a nice small pyramid of apophyllite i could wear the rock would have been fine like that if it were a specimen but to me its not very attractive as a piece of jewelry and i image it would get caught on a lot of thingsbr br aside from the the growth the crystal itself appears somewhat like a dirty quartz i like how the like is reflected by the fractures and its reminiscent to me of a glacier with the thin black smudges and white topbr br the only other reason i would remove a star other than the growth is check your findings because mine was very frail and fell apart within minutes of having it out of the package once tightened it seems like it will work fine but its pretty maliablebr br also anybody wondering and hoping they might get two stones i will say i only received one well and my tiny piece of pink salmon lol,1
just love this shirt,2
my husband really likes wearing them and i like that you can buy different colors in one purchase as these arent that common however he got a hole in one of them the very first day he wore them and the seams seem to be falling apart the other two seem ok so far so i may buy them again in the future to see if this was a one time defect and if so change my review then but as of now i can only give 3 stars,1
i ordered cream color based on the photo which when held next to the object ill be using it on was a perfect match upon opening the jar i can see that is is a very pale yellow not at all cream you might try going with the ivory if you want cream,0
i returned this for reasons which will quickly become obvious i took the pants out of the plastic package and put them on then i began to slide my belt through the belt loops i was somewhat startled when i couldnt fit my belt through the back loopor the side loop or the front side loop or the right front loop i took the pants off to examine them and found only three loops the front the front left and the rear leftbr needless to say i returned these for a refund and am seeking another brand amazon thanks for the quick refund and easy return policy,0
terrible fit and design,0
i got exactly what was pictured with know gimmicks or tricks good quality a little flat shaped not contoured to a face like some other sunglasses ive owned the mirrored lens is amazing it also came with a travel bag for them a microfiber cloth for cleaning and a mini screwdriver in case the hinges ever come loose for 15 id say i hit the jackpot it came with way more than 300 ray bans i love them,2
i bot this set in royal blue but instead the color came in dark blue it totally messed me up because my job required the color royal blue scrubs anyway it costed me 10 to ship the stuff back and i ended up buying the set in a local store at a cheaper price ughi will never buy apparel online again,0
stopped working in two weeks hopefully the replacement lasts longer nice looking piece of metal however,1
the print was good and the fabric is what youd expect for a basic t shirt but the proportions are so odd the shirt width was much smaller compared to other t shirts of the same size and was so long it went down to my thighs practically a dress length,0
videoidfb9d49851a94bbf365d4865e5cd2248 i was expecting a plain ring like what it looked like in the picture,0
slow ship from overseas kids loved them though,1
there are two versions of this hat one is made in the usa and the other is made in china i bought the usa hat first and then bought the china version unknown to me at that time the made in china version label stitching was off center and the hat was slightly smaller the usa version was better fitting and the label had cleaner stitching the n is new london looked like a m,0
this is a very nice kids set it is soft and very comfortable it is flattering on the fit is very goodbr br we were pleased with the durability the quality seemed very good it seems like it will last a long timebr br it is very cute on the kids i like how it looks that it is a setbr br it is easy to wash that is a must for me with kids clothing i have a lot from this company and have generally been happy i would recommend it,2
arrived damagedbr metal supports for ears poking through the costume creates a safety hazard one is pulling offbr pictures do not convey the actual product the eyes holes are so large and black mesh they are basically transparent and you easily see wearers head ad face in the costume cost to return the item back to sender in china makes returning it a poor option i will update this review with pictures,0
fights cell phone and light weight quality is what i expected,2
the fold over waistband was too short for what i was searching for it was more of what youd find nowadays compared to a couple years ago,1
nice sock but runs small not true to size order up 1 size,1
beautiful,1
i had these shoes for a month and the fabric is torn by my heel this is my 4th pair of brooks running shoes and i am disappointed in the quality of this pair my other pairs were in great shape after a year but these hardly lasted a month,0
perfect for me right now losing weight helps until i buy a new size,2
i didnt get the pin i was suppose super mad but at least i got a refund,0
it would have been cute but it arrived with the circle part of the clasp completely broken off it was also a cheap plasticy material the chain and medallion were metalish,0
they fell apart with the first wear,0
fit is weird fabric near your side boob is loose very clingy material so it will show your humps bumps lumps if youre short it will be long on you,0
arrived broken,0
these might fit someone with narrow feet well but i have wide feet and the straps were tight and uncomfortable on my feet,1
i wish it had adjustable straps runs small in my opinion but it does stretch a bit if you want a snug fit stretching does distort color though,1
little more baggy than i would like but comfortable,1
really cute top shorts are just ok my daughter looks so dang cute in it,2
this was pretty cheaply madei returned my wifes,1
super cute and fits perfect was a lil bumpy after washing be careful not to wash with certain items,2
the glasses dont fit over top of her normal glasses and are too big for them to be worn without glasses in addition the yellow lens is not good for skin glare as it was indicated in the write up im waiting for my mom to give me the go ahead to return them,1
absolutely loved this bracelet beautifully hand painted would definitely buy again,2
for whatever reason skechers is trying very hard to ruin a great shoe i love my go walk 2 so much that i purchased them as gifts for my husband mother sister and stepdaughter the go walk 3 are nice but not as great these go walk 4 are not worth owning the toe box is narrow and pointed i have only worn them three times and already there are puckers in the fabric from my slight bunion my small toe and my big toe in the middle because the shoe is narrow i have had the first foot pain i have experienced in two years these are hard to get on and i am already stepping on the rear of the shoe it is folding inside and i have to dig it out they are rubbing on the back of my foot the fabric is both too ridged and too giving both at the wrong places i own seven pairs of skechers my husband owns three,0
i dislike the way the dress was made the breast area was too highand one side of the dress was longer than the other i did like the design,0
didnt come with the strap for the back so dumb returning,0
ok quality on material fabric,1
great looking and a great fit this one replaced my 20 year old arctic quilted lined carhartt coat the new one is better looking and has inside pockets my old one was better insulated and was heavier built maybe this one is for the south arctic still happy with it,1
not bad for the price,1
these are not terribly expensive nor are they super affordable on my income they are however what i consider expensive that said they are comfortable and seem supportive so far recommended just be prepared for the price,2
its ok looks ok covers the head had a sweat band thats ok i am not really impressed nothing is wrong with it just not a favorite,1
i ordered the wrong size but they work well for what i ordered them for,2
disappointed,0
i really like this jacketbr br fit is right on definitely waterrepellentbr br problem is the thread is cheap its literally falling apart due to thread breakage i question any hard use especially if you need to depend on it,1
sent back not happy with product sent back for another rockport style,1
looks good but its a hassle to put on vs any other band,0
they look like a size 1 but they stretch all the way to size 3x very cute and comfortable,2
super cute looked as picture sizing runs small i was sad because it was so cute size up if its an option,1
watch band closure was scratched right out of the package,1
to small,0
got this for my bf he loves it fits well and comfy for the gym according to him,2
sweatshirt i ordered as 2xlt way too long below butt,1
material very rough and feels cheap,0
the necklace was broken the clip like attachments it looks very nice in the picture but when i got it in the mail there was quite a big difference i would not buy this item again thank you ie barnish,0
great material soft and lightweight just wish it was true to size ordered 1 size larger than i wear cant fit the tank over my boobs,0
ugly makes me look huge,0
very poor quality thin strips of leather is supposed to hold my foot in place the straps were already distorted and flipped sideways just from packing and shippingbr sent back,0
its what you would expect for the price materials are cheap and started pilling and fraying after the first wash theyre way bigger than expected and not supportive in the slightest the plastic connectors in the back are too large for the straps so they twist up and poke and itch the straps that stay after you open the front to feed are located midbreast which makes you look like you have 4 weirdly misshapen breasts or smash them together not breathable either please dont buy these bras such a let down literally,0
broken on arrival,0
very comfortable i loved them very sparklyi am happy i bought them,2
havent tried it on my girl yet but its really cute wasnt sure how to contact seller but we didnt receive the hair bow for the outfit i bought two outfits for my daughters but the bow didnt come with them,0
you better be a small infant if you want to wear the medium hahahah,1
i ordered for my mom and she loves it got the red one in large fit it great she sits a lot and ive had a rough time finding one that didnt have a tight tail this one is a little fuller at the tail and doesnt bunch up on her when sitting she loves the 34 sleeves she said she can wash dishes and not get them wet it does attract lint but small price to pay for the comfort,2
i just love it,2
very nice product good quality recommend,2
good product and good service,2
i got it for my lil sis and she loves it but didnt fit as expected but since its batman she still loves it,2
im 4 10 100lbs and bought the small it was way too loose and long i shouldve known better,0
pretty,2
just know that after you wash it dont dry it it shrunk in half gave it to my 8 year old granddaughter it also faded really bad and i waited a month to get it dont buy this,0
the clothmaterial on these is extremely thin like almost panty hose thin to make a slight exaggeration i have this exact same sock from a few a few years ago and the difference from the material of a pair from back when thats been worn and washed who knows how many times to this one is disappointing putting these on was like putting on a thin pair of dress socksbr br i understand its all about the profits cutting the material by 50 means a hanes saves money on manufacturing and b the socks wear out much faster and thus they sell more of the higher profit socks its a win win for hanes stock holdersbr br but we the wearers sufferbr br i shipped mine back and ill look elsewhere,0
a little slippery outside pool but they are great in pool,1
my boyfriend loved it,2
fit was small even with stretch lace was kind of scratchy i wanted to love it but the model wears it way better than me unfortunately had to return,1
i really like this i was actually surprised at the quality of this item i wasnt expecting anything this nice at the price excellent value beautiful garment,2
these are adorable i love the little foot shaped gripper on the bottom makes it easy for my toddler to put them on the right foot we use these for her classroom slippers they are perfect,2
these masks fit over my nose and mouth very well they also cover the cheeks too they dont fall down when i am talking theres enough space for breathing they shrank maybe 12 inch after washing in cold water and hung to dry because they are made of 100 cotton the nice thing is the metal nose clip didnt get deformed or lost in the mask after washing i have had other cloth masks do that the adjustable ear loops are comfortable theres a pocket for a pm25 filter but filters are not included my husband tried it and it fits his face well so i think the size is good for average men women and teenagers they are good masks,2
when my sister got it it was already comming apart but she wanted a leather jacket so bad she didnt tell me about it until she wore it once and it started peeling,0
i like this im not fond of the seam as i feel it may tear or fray i dont wear my keys daily i usually have this clipped on my backpack im afraid if i carried it daily that the cute print would fade it hasnt yet based on how i use it i purchased a silicone one for work keys since i handle those morebr br cute i like the tassel easy to find keys and carry them,2
beautiful but order a size up for room,1
this was is very beautiful and lightweight i got a lot of compliments on this dress i would definitely recommend it to others,2
style not as expected item was returned no refund,0
received only one earring didnt even get the pair,0
too small,0
the fit 2 keeps popping out i needed to find a better band,0
they are kool but they were bigger around than they appeared,0
tried to connect a hic syrup box to my pepsi system this adapter isnt right at allbr br the seller however replied to my issue and stated it would accept a return they also offered to assist in finding the correct converter so no stars for the product but several starts for the customer service,1
absolutely beautiful color and feel great buy for the money,2
returned didnt like the feel of the material light tsheet material see through fit good,0
its a nice enough product for its price but i was expecting a soft cotton outer material,1
it fit well but the band at the top is at least 2 sizes smaller than the rest of the bottoms very uncomfortable and tight,0
i knew they were cheap but not that cheap shouldve gotten better quality glasses,0
gave one star because its not the actual pic of what i purchased it was a tshirt,0
hard to get onhad to cut off,0
very impressed with the packaging the necklaces are good quality,2
the arms seemed to be a little short but i still wear it,1
these are cute and fit great in the arch but kill my heel,1
im 54 and these hit mid calf based on the photo i was expecting them to be longer,1
the size 9 was a little big and i returned it from and exchanged it for the 8 12 it fit better around the ankle area but my toe is right at the top im trying to stretch the 8 12 for my trip,1
men buy and try once you do you will use every day man bagpurse lol a must buy,2
good value for design,2
a bit too cheap looks good for second ear piercing but wont last long,1
hands are still cold,1
small small,0
i bought this for my wife for her birthday last week ive bought many things from pattyboutik in the past for her and been very happy with them wife was excited to wear this for the first time today but unfortunately the sleeve cuff is coming apart at the seam disappointing but i have not contacted amazon yet hopefully i can get this resolved and i can update my rating,0
its too stiff,1
received this sweater today and although i like the weight and the oversized feel and fit of it the color is not at all like the beautiful light beige in the photograph in fact id say the color is really more camel brown or caramel much darker and not flattering to skin tones which skew towards light to pale olive its comfortable and warm but the color is way off so ill probably send it back and order yet another black sweater,0
the top is not the length its shows it dits more at the waist and doesnt go down over your butt at all i was hoping to be able to wear it with leggings,1
set the watch to the correct time and the watch doesnt keep time bummer too it looks stunning,0
i have multiple types of darn tough socks that i love but not these ultra lites all of my other socks fit perfectly but these run much smaller than the other models i have purchased from darn tough they are uncomfortably tight and seem to slide around on my feet,1
i ordered my size they are to small i followed the size chart i wish i had ordered a size up,0
it was old one and not the new actually,0
very cheap material it does not hug your body like the photo,0
love these earrings they look just like the photo,2
inner seam was not stitch properly and had a 6 inch hole,0
gorgeous and feels great,2
top fit perfectly the bottoms are way too large,1
i did not get the color represented in the picture all thew its a nice wallet for the money i payed i would have liked the shown what i received was a dark gray in color,1
size according to breast size ran too big,1
theres absolutely no support in the bust,0
poor quality,0
quality of the earrings itself is good hence the two stars but cannot see the printed pattern without magnification i bought these because i loved the color and the steampunk pattern that shows on the product picture but was disappointed when they arrived even holding it up close just inches from my face i cannot make out the design i had to literally use a magnifying glass to make it out looking in the mirror two feet away the earrings look like they are solid black,0
not great quality either,0
nice swimming trunks good quality and value for the price,2
slippers are well constructed and comfortable the lower stars are because the straps are a lot shorter than expected my motherinlaws feet are very swollen and i was hoping the velcro straps would give her the flexibility needed they really need longer flaps on top if they are going to advertise these for people with edema,1
very cheaply made i got it for a gift for my great niece,1
i love the length of these they come to the knee which is very hard to find i ended up ordering more in a med to wear under dresses,2
my favorite shirt,2
this shirt is actually really well made the material is sewn well and the fabric feels great i normally wear a 2x and order a size bigger but considering the biggest they had was 2x i relentlessly ordered a 2x i cant say i was as disappointed as i thought i would be the shirt initially fit it fit a little bit small but it was still wearable after being washed and dried it shrunk and doesnt fit any longer the lettering looks nice but my concern would be how long it would last up in the washbr br i really like this shirt i just wish they had bigger sizesbr br 34 i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review 34,1
received with broken clasp,0
somewhat cheap material,1
totally like these pants especially the pockets to hold my phone but lordy they are tight it was like putting on spanx im ordering the next size up this time around,1
great shirtand very soft with pockets,2
its pretty but its a bit smaller than i expected and not quite as shiny but still a cute present,1
so pretty just same as model,2
i loved the shape style and the way they fit my face but sadly mine arrived with a big scratch on the right lens,1
i ordered a large and they were way too small,0
i was looking for comfy thongs to wear while working out that were also breathable i was tired of wearing my nice lacy lingerie these fit perfectly and have survived several washes in the washing machine,2
while it was too tight on my waist as a medium the color of the skirt was vibrant and the material wasnt bad either it was kind of weird that the zipper was on the right side rather than the left like zippers of these skirts usually are but for the price it was pretty good,1
very cute skirt but ran a bit small also the material is super thin and see through i kept it because its cute and i may wear it one day,1
i ordered an extra large bc thats what i wear it was a tight i had to peel it off it fit my daughter who is a smallmed,0
the viewing quality is great however i found the metal edge to be quite sharp which is a safety issue,1
beautiful and i love it but i was using it for our ring bearer to carry the rings it is way to small check the measurements before purchasing,1
not bad,0
i like the colors but white would be a good addition some type of pin with a a loop to keep you from loosing them,1
color was more red than i like also the leather loop to hold the excess after fastening was not permanently affixed so could just slide off the belt for these reasons i had to return it,1
its the best dress ive ever owned so pretty and amazing ive had it for four years now and im in love,2
overall this was a little on the large side but that was ok since im hoping my toddler can wear the shirt for easter too i purchased this as a christmas outfit not really a christmas color but i was trying to coordinate with his siblings outfit so this worked perfectly the outfit was of a good quality and was comfortable for my son it washed well and he received a few compliments on it overall i was very happy with this purchase,2
very poorly made band rips first time puting them on n separating from underwear them selfs not pleased at all worst thing ive bot on amazon thus far,0
my daughter loved wearing this for her trolls themed birthday party super cute and fit her great,2
big warning the tail is not printed on the back as pictured but is printed on the front my 4 year old still liked it but it does raise some interesting questions from other kids on why his shirt is on backwards,0
these are supposed to be over the knee socks but barely come to the knee disappointed with the height but they are cute for knee socks i would have given it 5 stars if it wasnt misrepresented by the photo,1
these are great for motorcycle riding on cooler days nice and warm durable construction,2
i like the cold shoulder style and it fits true to size i normally wear a large so i ordered the large in this and it fits great im 53quot and 150 pounds the color and design also looks just like the picture my only issue though which is a big one for me is the quality looks cheap the material is thin and silky but not in a good way it looks and feels like cheap polyester in my opinion i like the style of this top but because of the quality ill be returning it,0
needs to be taken in for my son,2
would not wear this anywhere,0
these stretch out and fall down but the grips on the bottom work really well,0
the calfs are tight so if you have a soccer play daughter i would pass however they fit my thin legs with no problem,1
these glasses are very lose and they came with something smudged on the lenses that i cant get off completely,1
like it a lot gets wrinkled easy,2
my little dancers loved these necklaces,2
made fairly cheaply but cute,1
i really want to love this band it is so pretty and would be absolutely perfect except the band does not want to stay connected to the fitbit it disconnects every time i try to take the watch off my wrist maybe it was a one off but i wouldnt buy again to replace,0
product fit as expected the fabric thinner than expected but will test next winter however mine arrived with the logo stamped at the top of the product likely right below check when worn disappointed but not huge deal and not worth the trouble replacing,1
the shape is weird so it isnt comfortable the cups are too small,0
watch worked fine for a couple weeks or so after christmas now it makes some noises but screen doesnt come on at all amazon doesnt show any option to returnreplace and its less than 60 days from purchase daughter is really sad,0
this dress is amazing i love it,2
love these super comfy i live in nicaragua tons of walking and surprisingly these shoes have held up,2
not so good i dont return muchlike 2 things every year i had to return this,0
i like this but it is too thin to be worn alone i wear a disposable mask and dress it up with one of these thy fit well and the ear loops are comfortable,1
nice and lightweight perfect for work,2
fit as expected they do not help with night time hot flashes the material is more dense than other similar competitor pjs this makes them less breathable i woke up feeling hot and sweaty as the moisture wicking feature did not work effectively as for fashion in person this leans towards an elderly persons wardrobe i bought two other brands at the same purchase and i much prefer the others,0
i have been extremely satisfied with these shirt stays i have never used shirt stays before so i have nothing to compare them too but these perform excellently and are very comfortable i have to wear dress shirts at work and my job requires a lot of walking sitting and standing so i often find that my shirt is no longer properly tucked in i try to maintain a professional image and a sloppily tucked in shirt doesnt fit into that profile these do the job perfectly and my shirt stays in place all daybr br as for comfort i have been very happy with how little i notice these while i am wearing them i dont notice them rubbing against my skin and i have no problems with them causing any kind of chafing or abrasions the metal clips that attach to the shirt are smooth and dont catch on my pants and the loop that goes around my heal is thin enough that i dont notice it at all in my shoebr br overall i am very pleased with these and would certainly purchase them againbr br i did receive these shirt stays for a reduced price i enjoy reviewing and critiquing products and do my best to provide a objective and unbiased opinion for all of the items that i review,2
too small,0
description of jogger or sport wear is not accurate material very sheer this should described a pajama wear or thermals,0
the belt was missing,0
the items arrived in a timely manner and appear to be good quality however they are not the items shown in the photos thus not what i ordered,1
loose fit very comfy,2
my mom bought these from dillards for her sore feet and she said they felt like walking on air until they deflated after wearing them only a handful of times one of the cushions in the sole of the shoe deflated causing the shoe to be unwearable we contacted romikas customer service by email but after weeks they still havent responded we called them and they told us to return them to the store which is not possible because she bought them while vacationing several states away look at this review on dillardscom to see that this has happened to other peoplebr httpwwwdillardscompromikatahiti03sandals505165218reviewheaderbr br they cost over 125 and they didnt even survive a few light wears over the summer do not buy,0
ni siquiera recibí el reloj,0
was a gift and my friend loved it,2
color is nice but the part that is over the foot vamp is tight if your feet swell at all they are very uncomfortable and no support for arches,1
painful to wear,0
i like it alot im glad i bought itfair priceit is prettya perfect fit,2
perfect with helmets that tend to move around and captures great amount of sweat very happy using this even in texas summer,2
i have not had this long enough to comment about how well it washes but let me say that i was extremely surprised and happy with the fit in my experience polyesterspandex 928 looks adorable on pregnant chicks but after you have the baby im about 20 months postpartum all it does is accentuate the baby leftovers i thought the busy pattern and cut might also help distract from my pooch i absolutely love this and let me tell you whybr br the cinching technical termrouching i dont sew much falls nicely under my bustline and actually helps slim my tummy then it floats nicely away instead of hugging every lump and bumpbr br i was concerned about the depth of the neckline but there is surprisingly enough fabric up there to give good coverage where i did not feel i was going to fall out bonus for a nursing mom the material is stretchy enough where i could easily feed the baby without worrying about where to hide so i could lift up my dress to feed or having to pass on this for a wedding or church or something because i cannot nurse in it the neckline shows off your decolletage without exposing too much i would wear this to church to bring the eyes up and away from the tummy area i am a 38c right now if that helps leave it open add a cute necklace or you could even layer a tank underneath to make it more modest when my phone lets me upload photos again i will post a pic with me wearing itbr br cute shoulder detail yet another way to distract from trouble areas nice coverage on the shoulders so you can still wear a bra without worrying about your strap showing plus it has cute little tassley things bonus baby distractorsbr br pattern also another great way to distract do you see the theme here my pattern did not look the same as what i ordered so just bear that in mind still pretty but not what i was expecting the chevron on the one i ordered also helps draw the eye to the middle which gives the illusion of smaller waist and hipsbr br length i am 56quot and this hit me about midcalf i prefer them floor length but also end up stepping on them that long so i think it works makes it versatile for casual wear or dressing upbr br i have not worn this in the heat yet but in past experiences i know that manmade fibers like polyester and spandex do not breathe particularly well so this may get a little warm but being sleeveless should help with that i am going to wear it this weekend so i will report back on that aspectbr br i am so happy with this dressit is so much more than i expected i was lucky enough to buy it at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review but i would and will buy more of,2
i have the high archtoe cinch problem i read about with the toe strap gets tighter with each step i have very high arches so i thought these might work but unfortunately it felt like the arch was in the wrong spot almost too far up i had to return them,0
great for travel and around town,2
do not buy this product has no sparkle no glitter totally false advertising am returning items,0
i think i would have liked it better in a solid color didnt look as full as i thought it would the 3 different colors,1
really pretty,2
very cute,2
the rash guard from hayabusa is definitely one of the best ones that ive ever used however its definitely pricer than most products i think its due to the fact that it has marvel licensed logo on the print compared to ua version its definitely a lot more stretchier and designed to be used for nogi or mma grappling session i personally love the punisher so it was nobrainer for me to buy it as soon as it was considered limited edition,2
though very soft material the access to what you keep in the pouch is awkward and difficult unless you pull your pants down reaching through the fly on your pants you have to access the opening on the under side of the drawers peculiar angles to work together at once having a peek hole to continually fit your body part through is just plain peculiar and feels distracting theyd be much better if they just had an large pocket area and a large typical fly,1
color did not match the picture,0
me agrado el producto estoy satisfecho,2
shoes are not only cute and comfortable but fit well the red tassels add a bit of color to the navy leather nice padding on the footbed great sandals to wear with either shorts pants or a dress,2
i really like this watch but i wish i could take a link out of it i would love it if it fit my wrist a little tighter,2
no me agradó que una pieza llegó quebrada,0
this shoe was not fitting my foot the quality is good well built shoe but not for my feet,1
i absolutely love uggs i do not wear socks with mine but you can i find them to usually run a little big so i size down,2
brooke first day,0
i used to wear earlier pants similar to the from lands end years ago i was looking for something a little nicer than a sweatpants for wearing on days off these are okay i find them short and a little heavier weight than i would like they arent my favorite and ill use them as its too much trouble to return them but i dont like them they seem to ride up on my calves whether through static or just fit im not sure,1
they are colorful and durable this is the second pair we have had awesome product to have if you are a boater,2
very nice my husband loved it,2
too small,1
i have owned my oakley flak jacket xlj sunglasses for 15 yrs or more now they have served me well and will continue to do so with these new lensesbr br my review is on the surf blue colored lenses this is my second lens swap over the years on this frame model both swaps have been with aftermarket lenses but these seem to be really close to the original brand as i do also have a new pair of oakleys with a similar mirror blue finish to these and cant tell much of a difference if anybr br these lenses dont come with any replacement instructions you can quickly do a search on the internet to find the instructions if you need them they are quite easy to replace just grab each lens with your index finger and your thumb close to the nose piece side and give them a slight but firm tug they will pop right out then dont be afraid to bend the frames a bit while installing these new lenses pop in the ear side first then bend the frames open to accept these new lenses and press them in repeat for the other sidebr br i tried to take a couple of pictures looking through these new lenses with my phone to give you an idea of the color tint you will be looking though see photosbr br im a fan of the blue mirror outer color of these lenses and how easy they were to install being polarized will also help reduce glare and eyestrain if you have an old pair of oakleys lying around give them a second chance life with these new lenses,2
this bag would be much better if the zipper was sewn all the way across the sides have gaps that could lose stuff the pattern is cute and washable,1
it did not come as described in the description the head does not fold into the caller or fold at all the pockets are shallow and dont zip and im not sure that it will prove to be water resistant the jacket is meaneor not unibelle,1
fit really weird,1
item as described,2
nice product excellent quality,2
really cute made well does exactly what is expected,2
not exactly what i expected,1
the sizing is way off get at least 2 sizes larger the material feels cheap and is spandexy if you have any kind of curves or are hourglass this dress doesnt look good save your time and money i returned,0
it definitely clings to every curve aka roll and it the fabric didnt wear well it became pilly after one wear,0
bad quality for this price just go to kohls marshall or macys and you will get something way better,0
you can see the foam through the sequins its like you literally just threw this together as cheaply as possible and it shows,0
these socks are nice because they are light however the sticky dots came off after only a few uses in pure barre classes,1
this is a very lovely headband it goes perfect with my dress and flowers it is bold and sparkly it is highly visable in my curly hair what comes in the box a rhinestone headband a storage bag two small rhinestones in a bag one large round rhinestone a flat pearl and a hot glue stick in a bag there are no pearl stones on the headband the first thing that i noticed is that the headband itself was missing three large stones none of them were round i immediately started digging and found them buried in the fabric liner of the box i did not use hot glue to put them back in i used a popular brand of tacky glue that takes 24 hours to completely dry next i started checking for loose stones the others appeared tight i will make a point to always put this one away in the bag or box i took off a star because i had to put the item back together i took off a star because replacement stones were included that are not for this product,1
the wallet overall is of good quality but i was expecting a much smaller version of this one too large for being minimal be sure you measure before you buy it i realized i wanted something the size of the business card wallet which is much more minimal,0
i really loved the fit on this however after a few washings inside out the whole front of the shirt pilled i know there are gadgets you can purchase to remove them im just not a believer in having to works so hard on keeping my clothes looking nice the shirt is now an outdoor working shirt sad,0
loved the look of this necklace i have had it for a totally for 4 days got it wet 2 times and its tarnished already,0
not worth the money,0
great price,2
very tight fit i ordered two different pair of sweat pants both size large for a loose fit these pants fit more like a size small the other pair of pants fit like a large,1
beautiful and made very well will buy from them again,2
i was so happy to receive these before my next clinical day today i have to say i am very impressed my legs done hurt at all and i was on my feet running around from 500 am to 200pm the only thing i dont like is the toe seam is a little loose but it isnt uncomfortable like regular socks can be,2
no clasp feather is not good blue stone poorly set chain is small worst br dont even waste even a dollor and wait for long to get itbr br even on top of all the above comments they responded in 1 day asked me to send a pic i did and they refunded back my moneybr i really loved the chain and asked to ship another one instead of refund but they said please re order and we would like to refundbr br thankyou and appreciate,1
i was nervous about this belt and rightfully so it was highly uncomfortable and it bends too easily im 57 and 130 pounds and felt like i was wearing a wonder woman belt not for me i returned it,0
a bit awkward but i made it work the delivery was amazing fast and efficient the bangs are a bit long for smaller facesbut ill work at it,1
junk,0
high quality fabric is supportive of my 36dd xl was the right fit i was concerned it would be too short but it suited my needs to wear under a wrap dress without bunching up at the waist the rose color is very pretty too,2
i had to give this coat a three because its cheap looking not warm at all more for like spring the style is nice,1
this shirt has marijuana leaves on it i bought for a gift how embarrassing,0
the front of the shoe is really wide wider than normal didnt work for my narrow feet,1
videoid464e91f7ae42e75cca6735993dff9ecc this costume gave my demon dr a great look see for yourself,2
ordered red and got black,0
ok,2
weirdly shapedvery widedoesnt look like the shape of a foot,0
it fits my 5yr old perfectly he will outgrow it quickly the material is great i liked the fact that it has really small holes for mouth and ears the thing i did not like about it is the super strong smell since it doesnt come with washing instructions i34ll have to contact the seller to find out about it,1
liked it,2
i have seen this on many blogs so decided to try it it didnt look good on me the color washed me out i didnt like the high round neck i would have preferred a v neck didnt suit me but looks great on many others,1
great comfortable crocs the straps keep them on securely,2
does protect the butt but not the front ended up replacing the bike seat,1
very small and not really worth the money the screw on end becomes loose easily and comes off and the keys fall off i ended up losing it all together,0
eh it looks cuter in the photo than it does in person has a fake leather appearance wasnt quite what i was expecting,1
one side is missing the center thing ill have to return and reorder,1
its nothing like the pic its a halfshirt and its way too thin to be called a sweater ill usually a lg or xlg depending so i purchased a xlg but it was way too big and i ordered the light gray and i received more of a cream color im not sure what the other reviews are referring to but its not soft i couldnt begin to tell you what the fabric is and honestly if i kept it id be afraid it would fall apart in the wash oh and it came with no tags so i couldnt determine which was the front and which was the back for 33 no thanks,0
i would highly recommend this hat it is made well and the color is a beautiful wash out gray just buy it,2
way to large and not very good fit,0
just fine for a young girl,1
i ordered this ring for a temporary replacement of my wedding band while it was in the 34shop34 i was very disappointed from it because the hearts were complete squished and didnt look like hearts anymore i will not be buying another,0
my husband is an elevator mechanic and his wallets wear all the time and his cards get dirty and then the strips dont work i really liked this wallet you can feel the craftsmanship and i love the lifetime guarantee i love that its made in the usa we will see how this wallet handles the test of timebr con i wish i looked closer there is no pocket on the side of wear the cards go in most of the time my husband likes to slide a picture of the kids in that pocket its or my fault for assuming there would be onebr thanks for the excellent craftsmanship,2
super cute and big they long like a pen 2 of them the price is amazing,2
this is more of a earth tones then the rose quartz or moonstone coloring but its still a pretty necklacebracelet,1
it fit well in the bag for which i bought it however it is a little more flimsy than i hoped it would be im sending it back be cause i cant get the zippers to open and close ive reevaluated the use of this bag and intend to use it for something other than what i ordered it to be used as it has nice pockets and is very roomy in center pocket therefore i will be keeping it,1
super cute and simple im a us size 46 with a small c cup bra the small fit perfectly,2
i gave them away because even with the stretch they wouldnt fit i ordered a size bigger than i take and they were still too small,0
after reading all the terrible reviews i didnt even open the box,0
nice 3 piece bracelet set,2
love this dress i was so worried buying this but i am so glad i did i purchased it for my wedding rehearsal and im in love fits perfectly and runs true to size i will say unless you are very tallhave very long arms the sleeves are definitely a lot not 34 and more like full sleeves but i just sort of pulled them up to make it shorter i was worried about it being hot with the longer sleeves but the dress is pretty thin and cool so i think itll be perfect for all seasons it is a little more on the thin and see through side though so you may want to wear something underneath for extra coverage besides that i definitely recommend,2
these are very cute underwear and my girlfriend looks great in them ive heard of crotchless panties before but these are the oppositebottomless panties well they have a bunch of lace but its seethrough so theyre kind of bottomless the seethrough lace is only on the backside and on the front they look like traditional underpants theres also a little eyehole at the upper back theyre very high quality and i liked them a lotbr br i got the red ones and i thought they were the best color but the other colors are nice toobr br simplicity gave me these underthings to review,2
they arrived all bundled up in a plastic bag 2 were broken and the rainbow bead earrings were hotglued on the back all were very poor quality,0
the fabric of this dress is like a garbage bagits like taffeta but stiffer and plasticier i bought it in black and the fabric somehow attracts powder including powder from laundry detergent chalk and dust from the air i know that sounds crazy but i wore it one time i washed it and it somehow picked up powder in the wash i tried a million things to get the white marks off to no avail maybe youd have better luck than i did but i wouldnt buy this again,0
hoping to get some more room from my bra strap but the hooks and loops just dont line up with any of my bras disappointed,0
nice sweater but if wool bothers your skin at all this may not be for you i like the sweater but probably wont keep it due to the wool content even with a longsleeved shirt underneath it the cuffs and the turtleneck are irritating my skin a little bit it could be better after washing but ill never know i also think it runs slightly large but probably not large enough that id want to size down,1
this particular model of fila running shoes runs a little short this pair is wearable but not great i just bought a pair of fila running shoes from costco that fits much better interestingly the size i picked when i tried the filas at costco was 95 the model i ordered from amazon is a 10 and is still a little short plus the heal is too deep so i need to wear them with heal pads,1
so short that they gather up in my hoohoo after about 1 hour of wearing 5 stars on comfort because fabric of top bottom very soft they are not warm as they are summer pjs,1
i loved the color the dress was only good for a few wears and washes before it started looking shabby served its purpose but not a dress that will get a year of wear,1
in love with this sassy thing wish there were more colors i have the red the white and the royal blue i have many other black golf skorts or i would have purchased that color too i like my skorts mid thigh and this is a great length i ordered the xxl and i wear xl in most other elastic waist band skorts so go up a size so so soft,2
i hate wearing anything on my feet but i came across these at a local gift shop and feel in love,2
im a 36c and ordered a large the bra is not supportive and is too low cut it barely covered me too bad because they were cute,0
the color was not as bright as the one shown in the picture but very comfortable and the pockets are small,0
using their size chart i went up a size out of caution the band fit fine but the cups are insanely small i am between a d and dd depending on brand and the amount of spillage was completely unacceptable returned,0
the product description said polarized bit they are definitely not polarized they are okay lenses but dont say they are polarized if they arent,0
i love this dress better than i did online its such a nice material its soft like cotton but also stretchy it has a hidden zipper on the side its form fitting without being tight it is very flattering to the figure very classy and it hides my belly fat,2
fits well,2
they are great garden shoes just what i was looking for,2
fits good lights suck the shoes never want to charge all the way,1
ive bought these before at macys so i know what to expect from the real deal these are fake garbage not even close to the original,0
this one is too small and i cant tell if i would like it better if i had a larger size the shorts have a tight elastic wasteband that really needs to sit at the smallest part of my waist but theyre not high waisted enough to do that without being up in my business if i pull them down theyre really unflattering on my sides the top is equally weird my boobs arent really huge but there isnt enough fabric to accommodate without tugging the shirt up or down material wrinkles super easily it might be flattering in a much larger size but i dont think its going to suit my body type no matter what could look super cute on someone else maybe,0
very comfortable and stylish,2
i am doing a half a penywise for halloween got this and some other stuff to complete it i like it cause it doesnt cover all of you so i wont over heat in it seems to be very universal in size too could fit prob about anyone,2
hazmat label must be attached to return package yes made with hazardous materialbr hazmat label printed with reg return label and hazmat label which must be attached also so i call amazon and they check it sure enough made with some sort of hazardous material,0
this was my 3rd pair of compression socks the other 2 were from sockwell and i had no problems with those unfortunately this pair felt way too tight at top near my knee the foot is the right size and the length is ok just too tight i cant wear them someone with thinner legs then mine would probably have no problem,1
i love the color and style but they run big i am a 99 12 i bought a size 9 and they are too big,1
i like the look of these earrings but they are a bit heavy and off balance the weight makes them pull down even when i added a supportive back they dont lie flat on your ear too bad,1
good price i like the style as far as texture its like plastic and little tight on wrist,1
i bought this shirt one size up so it would be nice and baggy and looser fitting it looks really great with tight leggings or pants i got the wine red shirt and the satin a soft flowing material feels terrificbr its the perfect holiday top you can wear it to the office with a scarf by day and then put on a blingy necklace and some heels and go out at night i personally think this wine red is really festive with some sparkly jewelry my daughter will want to probably built it with one of those chunky belts that are in right now and were at with leggings and boots all in all this is versatile and a really good buybr make sure you measure but i honestly think everything ive gotten from the store has fit exactly as it was supposed to but then i am a conscientious shopper when shopping online so i have a lot of luck,2
had to return this product too large,0
real junk im sending back 2 pairs,0
i like a big cotton sweatshirt to snuggle in this one feels stiff dont like the polyester feel and it doesnt shrink so now i have a big boxy stiff sweatshirt would not recommend,1
i was excited for this pajama set im sort of a jammie junkie jammies and lingerie are my ish but this set fit awkwardly the top was wide tight and short as heck sadly i returned,0
i was so excited when i opened this it really is cute i have another adar top thats similair but one of the snaps is broken this top has the option of adjusting the waist so i tried the snaps on the smaller option as soon as i did the button broke adar youve got a lot going for you but these buttons have to go they suck im going to wear this top today and i still want you to send me a new one this is the 3rd button of yours that ive had to wear in this state why dont you charge 5 more dollars and get some that dont fall apart grrrr,1
love them however they are too heavy for me,1
these were nice but they were really thicker than i thought they would be and didnt fit in my boots very welll,1
durablecomfortablequality flip flop fits as expected,2
too large and unbreathable,0
these run huge i am normally a medium and the smalls are too big im 510 150 and have never worn an xs in my life but i think theyd have fit better plenty long the light army green ones are also very see throughif you have any cellulite whatsoever it shows the darker maroongrape pants are a little darker and not quite as see through theyre just okay in my opinion the darker colors will show less i believe but i wish i felt comfortable in the green ones because theyre cute just houselounging pants though i did wear the darker grape ones for a high intensity workout and they were okay theyre a bit big so it felt like they were bunching and sagging at times id suggest ordering one or maybe even two sizes down from your normal size,1
not too tight just order 1 size more than you are,2
id like to contact the seller but not seeing that option i only recieved 4 face masks not 5,1
look this is a gag gift dont expect an armani for or quality pants are elastic and would been nice if had belt loops to put a belt on seeing its kinda one size fits all youll have to use suspenders to keep them up also lights last one second or so that was biggest disappointment i bought it for the silliness of lights blinking lol when i wore i turned in and first ten seconds were bright but then just faded and stopped so that was disappointing,1
the original chain to my anniversary necklace broke this is a slightly different rose gold than what i originally had but its still very pretty and probably will hold up better as its not as dainty,2
not happy these killed my feet the heel is low on the insert and the toe is stiff so you end up over using your achilles tendon they look okay and accurate to the picture and they are lightweight other than that i would not buy this brand again,0
wow impressivegood qualitysleeves banded wont stretch out came in a beautifulblack box this company sets out to give youbaxquality product i am ordering another pair hope they carry for women too,2
very tiny more for a toddler,0
not the best of the pro series dont buy for work but okay for casual wear,1
with only 1 review i was nervous to order from this company but so glad i did i ordered sent my measurements to them via amazon mail and received a reply within 24 hours that they could custom make my size it came in a bit sooner than expected and it is gorgeous fits perfectly to my figure perfect length they even made the builtin bra to my ddd size the dress fits like it was made for me cause it was i normally wear a 14 but ordered a 16 so it could be customized i did mess up and forget to order a zipper back so it came in as a lace up my hubby can help when it comes time to wear it so not a big deal i am more than thrilled with my purchase as you can see in the second picture some of the lace on the sleeves looks frayed where it was cut but that should be simple to fix highly recommend this company and this dress,2
not happy,0
la máscara está hermosa y es perfecta el material es buenísimo pero los agujeros de la cara estaban mal y hacían que quedará torcido el disfraz tuvimos que cocerlos y hacer unos nuevos estaba mal ensamblado,1
love it so far very pretty and dainty have only worn it a few times so well see how it holds up but for the price its great,2
was disappointed in the quality of the material is more of a shiny where the crossover is you see it over the boob and is not attractive,0
shirt fits well the problem comes when you try to wash it after it is removed from the washer it picks up lint and we are in the process of trying to figure out how to remove the lint prior to irone,1
love the item,2
perfect fit,2
so many nooks and crannies i love to compartmentalize so this was an inexpensive bag but so functional people also tell me they really like it,2
the watch is a beautiful watch but i just cant leave it 5 stars due to the difficulty in seeing the numbers the markings do no show up well in any lighting the watch looks great it has a large face but the actual watch is small if you cant see the markings on the watch you cant tel what any of the gages are telling you,0
shades are obviously cheap not from gucci store,0
im 57 and 130 lbs and it wraps around me 12 way,0
did not fit correctly,0
i bought them cause it says stainless steel which doesnt give me metal allergy reactions but i get itchy when i wear these earrings so i dont think they are made of stainless steel,0
so pretty flowing luxe fabric in a gorgeous color true to the picture,2
this running jacket fits way too small i am usually large for something to be a bit oversized and thats what i ordered it was so tight i cant even wear it in public,1
tshirt was extremely small even though i sized up i am not a large person also the neckline was stitched odd and didnt look or feel good on my husband asked what was wrong with the shirt also i order to return the only option was to return by usps post offie which means you need to purchase the packaging in order to return or the option to just leave the tshirt in my mailbox for the mail person um yeah i dont need to leave it for them and that is very strange,0
love these earrings great quality,2
based on the reviews that said these ran big i ordered my normal size thinking that theyd be baggy and cozy while they tend to be generally true to size they are more snug on the hips than i prefer but they are soft and cute and i look forward ri weary by them this winter,2
looks like a true robeez shoe some minor threads need to get cut out,2
these 34seemed34 a little set tight arms but nogive them a chancethey adjust nicely on your head and face very comfortable and lots of cover for the eyes i would buy again thx h,2
too small for my 10 yr old son,1
not true to size and it is cheaply made not layered as it appears in the picture,0
good kids gi our daughter loves it it holds up great,2
remember the olden days when we had simple magnetic strips on out credit cards and hardly any were skimmed then the credit card industry promised us a better more secure credit card with the chip and suddenly people could walk by us and skim our card through our wallets my how we have progressed so now the need for rfid blocking technology has become a very real thing enter this wallet i dont have a skimmer so im going to trust that this has been manufactured with true rfid blocking technology the wallet itself is compact as far as length and width but is kind of thick it is nice leather and looks good there is a snap closure of which im not a huge fan but it does stay snapped so that part works the credit card holder is aluminium and has a release mechanism that pops the cards up in a staggered stack this feature actually works very well and it holds standard size cards in place very securely you can get them to fly out but it takes a lot of downward force and in my many tries i could only get one or 2 cards to fly out the cards slide in easy and the slot holds 5 or 6 cards very well so far so good then i opened up the wallet and put in my license and a few bucks this is where this wallet starts to fail with just 2 insurance cards my license and 4 dollar bills the wallet became nearly impossible to snap closed after squeezing and tugging i can get it snapped but it is a struggle so parts of this wallet are great and parts just plain dont work love to hate it or hate to love it either way its 3 stars,1
i bought it for myself in an xlrg and ended up giving it to my 13 year old daughter who is a size 0 thank goodness shes tall so it works for her,1
bad quality,0
these are mega cute i love how they make me look,2
not bad i think i needed more padding,1
it is good but comes in a bag guess not bring hard case,1
these are my backup pair i dont use them a lot so they stay mainly in the case on my desk and get picked up when the others are hiding usually on my head a while back my admin was in my office and said youve got little black flakes on your cheek i didnt think about it again until a few days later i noticed the flakes again on the side of my head when i was looking in the mirror this is not a major problem and obviously it does not affect the way they work its just an inconvenience picking off the black coating most of the readers i buy look cheap mainly because they are i loose them so i dont want to spend on something i loose so i was really happy with the way these looked when i first got them so i will rub and peel off the remaining coating and move on overall i like the glasses they are lightweight and comfortablei simply hated to see them look the way they do,0
it looked nicer in the picture looks more like a nightgown,0
nice for chilly days but not 25 degree or below days,1
lost weight and needed smaller size these fit well are nice material and didnt break the bank like so many out there lately,2
not good i am returning,0
this is very pretty but the clast will not open at all it is very delicate so if you get it you have to be real careful,0
only downfall is its not a dark tint it actually shows in a bluish glare messes w sight a bit,2
i liked the weight and drape of the material it has some weight to it without being too heavy i am often between two sizes so i tried it in both medium and large medium fit well but there were a lot of visible lines from pockets a tucked shirt and panties those concerns were not present with the large but the waist was so loose being pull on pants that they didnt hang right this may be more of an issue of the quirks of my body than the pants but i had to return them,1
not matching the picture what i ordered the product looks modified from the original,0
ive been searching for an affordable silk type robe to wear while getting ready or to walk around in at home now that im 30 i feel like i needed to trade in the towel for a classy robe i ran across this one for 19 and it had good reviews im 51 145 lbs i ordered the small and it fit perfectly i have a little booty and it does peek out if i bend over its plenty big enough everywhere else overall excellent quality highly recommend,2
thick but would not say warm and after like 3 wears and washes its already begining to pill in the crotch area bought for cold winter day and high waist to help with postpartum belly,1
cheap enough so if you loose one its no biggie thanks,2
they are perfect for my cartilage piercing,2
needed some simple sneakers for summer to replace my old ones i usually by converse but these were cheeper and same style they looked nice and are ok on comfort but they have started to fall apart much sooner then the converse typically do,1
great,2
it folds down when bending over and other movements im constantly adjusting it,0
ripped easily,0
super comfortable will be ordering another pair in a different color great for lounging around the house,2
cute,2
this dress is the worst i knew from other reviews that it was wide in the hips but so am i however in this case hips were at the level of my ribs and im only 57 my husband literally fell on the floor laughing but even if the dress had been great i was disappointed to see how it came packaged it was literally wadded into a ball and stuffed into a plastic bag and it was inside out so who knows where this dress has actually been no surprise that this is a return,0
i got my normal size of medium but fits a lot tighter than expected around the waist with medium compression on legs the waist band also keeps rolling down which is very annoying,0
the first five minutes i had i tried to put it on my sprinkler and it was okay my pinky my middle finger but my index when i try to put it on the band snapped,1
i was frustrated by my regular shoelaces constantly coming untied and i didnt want to tie them in a knot so i tried these lock laces they make my shoes more comfortable because they stretch a little as i walk but my shoes stay firmly on my feet i tightened them until they are comfortable and now i leave them that way and dont slide the lock back and forth that means my laceup shoes are now slipons which is great for getting them off but i have a little trouble getting them on im not dexterous with a shoe horn so i just struggle a little bit i wish the black laces came in the dress shoe version without the white accents but it seems dress laces only come in brown i also bought the navy for a pair of navy shoes they look slightly dorky on my black laceup shoes that i wear in an office with black slacks but its worth it to not be constantly adjusting my shoelaces that were either too loose or too tight they would look better on casual shoes like running shoes but im very happy with the functionality,2
i have been looking for a simple white wedge all occasion for several seasons now finally found these i love the look but too big in the heel area would like the store to recommend a specific foot pad to use to not have this problem i am a normal 65 med width fit i love the shoes and do not want to return them as i know i will not find any other style that i like as well heel pads do not work they bunch up and make the shoe too small a thin foot pad made of thin silicon or similar would work better to take up a little rm and tighten heel area any suggestions otherwise style is perfect,1
it is a lovely piece does not run true to size,1
love love love this product the leather is very soft and so is the cashmere lining i put them on and i did not want to take them off even inside the house working with my smartphone is a breeze the red color is pretty close to the picture might be a tad brighter red,2
its a warm and thick material keeps my son warm,2
this dress looks nothing like the image it probably has to do with the fact that i am pretty tall 51134 will be sending it back,0
wayyyyyy too small,0
i am a true 65 this was huge i got same brand in diff style without lace and was ok lil big but ill keep and put an insole insert for arch support but this style very wide and the fabric look like will stretch out so if you have narrow or normal feet no good,0
i wear a true size 10 but these slippers are tightnot in width but in length the quality is good but i dont like to wear themthey just arent comfortable for me,1
absolutely love these,2
i really liked these when i first got them so much that i ordered another pairbr br after using both of them i have found that while the medium fits my waist perfect i am a 32 the legs area are a little looser than i would like they are slidingbr br i really liked these and wanted them to fit betterbr br updated i have had to consider buying other shorts as these are really lose in the legs,0
its very nice but huge its a men watch,1
little camel toe,1
watchband was nice until i washed it now its tight,1
i actually had already ordered a similar neck scarf with the same design for a costume but that one was thin and only had an elastic bandbr this one is much thicker and has an adjustable pull sting around the facelinebr it is a bit shorter though this one wont tuck into your shirt collar as well but its still long enough to not leave any skin exposed,2
this shirt is great for someone who loved science it really is uniquebr br this shirt is very comfortable it is very versatile and can be worn many places it fits well and feels very good we have other products from this company and have been happy with thembr br it is easy to wash and wear we wear shirts like these all the time because we would rather be comfortable it has a nice look to them it is flatteringbr br it was very soft it felt great onbr br the fit was goodbr br it feels durable i am pleased with the quality it is reasonably priced i would recommend thisbr br the print was really cute,2
i was expecting a different type of fabric and a better screen printing job,2
these are well made and very comfortable cant say as of now about durability but the look to be okay i will buy more,2
i bought three of these as costumes for some high school students and the reviews warned about them being small so i bought one size larger than they wore that was not enough i had to return them all and reorder larger sizes these were not for overweight girls either one girl didnt even weight 100 pounds and she took a medium once you get one that fits they look gorgeous and the girls said they stretched and felt good while they were dancing they wash well also so i would have given the review four stars with a simple warning about the size issue but one of them started ripping after only being worn twice so i took away one star if you are reading this and considering them buy two sizes larger than you wear they are worth the money since dance costume are usually expensive just buy them big,1
good fit,1
cute and comfortable kids slippers very soft easy to wash,2
lightweight cute and easy summer dress worth the lightning deal price however its def cheaply madethe pockets in mine werent stitched so theyre not really pockets just holes you can slide into and scratch your leg lol the gathers at the bustline are irregular so it puckers a lil weird in places im keeping it for the price though honestly might buy a floral one tooits cheap and comfy but you get pay you pay for,1
definitely not good material for a workout and it was too big on me,0
fits except it is a whole 12 inches or 3084cm past my feet,2
i do really like this shirt and it does fit well its just that it does this weird thing around the armpit area where it seems too small unlike many shirts you order online where they are very thin and bad quality this shirt is pretty thick and not see through and its sooo soft maybe if you buy a size up it will fit better around the arms,1
two stars because it does hold glasses no more because of the low quality within the first week the seam holding the side in place gave way and is flapping loosely i will not purchase this again and have question with the company that sells such a shabby item,0
gained 4 to 5 minutes a day,0
i was sent a dirty used product im mind blown absolutely disgusting done with clothing from amazon this deserves a negative 5 stars,0
exactly what i was looking forgood for taking walks at night,2
cute but way too large i had to return them,1
do not purchase broke in two days _,0
got 3xl and it was too small normally take size 2xl,1
i absolutely like the rich color as well as the shape and size of the bag would recommend for purchase,2
too small,0
the only reason im giving this 5 stars is that it is a very well made product when i ordered however i ordered the long petticoati received the short one so we will reorder and hope to get the correct one next time we have started the return process on this one,2
this is a very nice hat but not 5 stars because it is a bit big for a woman and the brim is huge and the head portion is large also i would expect it to be sized more for a woman it will fit if i tighten it up a lot but will be high,2
i actually love this swimsuit it is a cute design im 57 125 d cup and ordered a medium the top is super adjustable to fit different chest sizes 4 stars because the stitching was a uneven,2
i really dont know why everyone loves this the fabric was not breathable it was not cute and flowy like the pictures it is a very heavy warm fabric that does not lay as nicely on the body as the pictures suggest definitely not something i would be comfortable wearing in warmer weather like most of my dresses the designcolors are nice the length is good i am 510 its an ok dress it will not become a favorite of mine at all but i may wear it occasionally in cooler weather,1
beautiful color value and fit well constructed,2
cute sunglasses not the quality that i have seen before but they are definitely unique n bold i plan to still rock these,1
i wanted this bag because of its perfect overnight size and i looked too quickly added to cart and purchased when it arrived i realized it was not a herschel but a wanna be that ripped off the tag design so blatantly it was embarrassing i had to return immediately because id rather have the real thing than sport this fake around,1
so pretty i am not sure if it is 45 pretty yet,1
my favorite color besides aquamarinebr they are great,2
not all mask had wire for nose as advertised,1
i gave two stars because it advertises use on fishing rod grips do not apply to rod grips may work fine on shoes or other things that you do not need to grab but no good for rod grips leaves them tacky and they clearly look like there is a shiny coating on them if you too made the mistake and applied this stuff to a rod grip then you are in luck here is what you do use a hot wet towel to remove this stuff from the grip you will need to hold it on the grip then rub the glue off this stuff seems like nothing more than school glue just slightly thinner once you have removed it look on amazon for u40 cork seal a couple of dollars more but this is the stuff it soaks in and applies easy end result is a nice softer cork feel only upside to me using the cadilac sealer was the process to remove it must have removed dirt and made the cork exceptionally cleani am sure there is an easier way to do that though,0
i didnt like the fact it was an american flag hat that was made in china i would rather buy one made by veterans or americans,0
this was part of the birthday present for my friend and shes absolutely going to love it more than i do thank you so much,2
i would expect better quality and i would also expect the belt to last longer but it wears down quickly thought dickies would have been better quality very surprised,1
decent quality please remember its a costume not a real dress,2
this material is not leather its plastic and it looks cheap,0
every opening in this thing is too small the credit cards wont fit the drivers license wont fit and even though it says genuine leather it looks and feels like plastic very disappointed,0
i order a few different brands and this was one of my favorites extremely soft great fit on my legs unfortunately it lands just below my waist so it is not very flattering,2
i already owned this bra from an earlier store purchase so i knew what to expect the band on this amazon purchase 3rd party seller was a bit looser the store bra and descriptions ive read elsewhere did warn the band on this style ran small which would have been fine with me this one still works but it is a bit looser than i expected comfortable bra straps do sit further apart,2
love it,2
cuter than photos so sparkly,2
my dress i order have a hole in it i put it on for mothers day in the old is it have a hole in it,0
my low rating is for the marketing practices of carhartt not the people laboring to make them nor the awesome quality of their work for the money they spend on promoting their clothing as the backbone of hardworking american men and women my carhartts were made in vietnam the resting ground of many hard fighting american men to this day i have a problem with thatbr the ripstop scrubs are a must have if you are responsible for your own housekeeping these are wellbuilt and the sizing is actually almost perfect i ordered this top along with the pants in olive green and the caribbean blue and i gotta tell ya the pants are the best scrub bottoms ive ever invested inbr again my only beef is that they are made in vietnam carhartt spends ridiculous amounts of money to portray its american relevancy so sadly while they are awesome scrubs and the workmanship top shelf ill not purchase anymore ive since found nurse joes a google search will lead you there and they are american made scrubs and less expensive ive ordered a set to see if they are any good or not and ill update this review once i receive them,0
the band arrived very quickly i just love it,2
runs very small,1
i really liked these until i rode in them i tried several times but they just never felt comfortable the fit was fine but the material was odd not as stretchy as id expected stiff and felt awkward,1
this item is just beautiful and well made i am very pleased highly recommended to others,2
i absolutely love this necklace it is beautiful and photos almost dont even show the beauty it beholds the red is a gorgeous deep color and the crystals around the heart are very prettybr i also really like the chain on this it has a lobster clasp and is adjustablebr the overall look of this has expensive taste and the silver chain really accents it nicely i get lots of compliments on this it goes along with so many outfitsbr this necklace makes a lovely gift for your or someone else it comes in a lovely box as wellbr i received this item discounted in exchange for my honest unbiased review i was not compensated in any other way,2
this was a present for my daughter and she loves it its beautiful and very well made the price was great and it arrived quickly in perfect condition,2
nice bright colors great size for rolling into headbands which is what my daughters use them for,2
the leggings are not as described a completely different pair of leggings than what is pictured the leggings i received have pockets on the side i was looking for a smooth black legging with no pockets on the outside,0
small holes in the white shirt straight out the packageno washing instructions on clothing at alllight and comfy tho,1
poor quality inside sheds like crazy gets all over your t shirt even after washing cheap cheap cheap would not recommend or buy again looks good from outside but for that price expect it not to shed like a dog do not buy trash,0
i wanted to love this dress but definitely didnt meet expectations it looked as pictured the lace was perfect color on spot until i put it on it fit perfectly around my chest but was like wearing a potato sack the material was swishy like wind breaker material and the dress fell way past my knees unfortunately returned this item,0
first time wearing these socks and theres already a hole in one of them i will be returning,0
fake nikesbr barely used it and the back of my heel are blowing bubblesbr dont buy them,0
other than the item not qualifying for prime it was fine,1
this isnt as nice as it looks in the picture the flower on it is off center and the clasp broke the first time i used it i replaced the clasp and fixed that problem,1
silkey on the outside but rough on the inside these are the same size as ones i am using but they run much smaller they are generally uncomfortable and i will not be wearing them have washed them so cant return but certainly wont buy again,0
paper thin i had to put black tights under it still didnt look good,0
they are very warm and water proof my complaint the lining isnt sewn in every time i take them off i have to push the fingers back where they belong,0
excellent product,2
the belly area was hugethe length of the pants was shortdid not fit well at alli am 62 210lbs,0
i am 55 and 135lbs size d bra ordered the medium but its so large on me i could fit two people inside of it i would order down a size wearing it with a belt does help also its a bit too polka dotty for me wish they were smaller dots or not as white,1
my husband wears this when he is chilled but normally has a button up on underneath and he is warm in the house this looks neat and he likes it he is asian slightly smaller than american height and weightgot him a small i think it is neat looking except for the pilling under the arms and near the pocketshas only been a couple months and is already pilling,1
it smelled awful,0
perfect fit,2
its snug,1
fit good did not shrink after washing,2
well they lasted just over a month i would expect them to last longer purchased aug 30th so just past the returnable stage hmm,0
ive seen some reviews mentioning that the key ring is made of titanium and therefore feels cheap well i think they werent quite that honest it feels like plastic and bends a bit too easily for my taste if your keys have a small key carrier hole dont buy this it wont sit right as per my attached pictures kinda disappointing and not worth the money ill give it two stars overall because if you have no other alternatives it gets the job done,0
i own about 20 pairs of shoes all of them are size 10 i ordered these in a size 10 and couldnt even get it on my foot halfway they look really great cant say if they are comfortable since i couldnt even get them close to being on my foot i had to double check the size to make sure they even sent me the right ones they didthey are just small,1
exactly what i was looking for,2
this product is almost perfect love the credit card slots with the rfd protection love the cell phone pocket and the wrist handle just wish there was one more slot for receipts or other cards that do not fit the standard size card,2
this gives great support and pretty enough it runs a tad small and it is scratchy weirdly scratchy i would probably never have tried it on at a store once i touched the material,1
unfortunately this dress was not at all what i expected its material is really thin and a cheap polyester it looks so much nice in the pictures it didnt work for my however i did give it to my friends daughter who seemed to be happy with it it would be fine for a younger person say 1825 possibly in my opinion just because it didnt necessarily work for me doesnt mean it wouldnt work for you i normally do not purchase clothing on amazon and thought i would give it a try for once being that i received this product at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review,1
knocked off a star because the heather hunter green just looks gray does not look olive or greenish at all like in the picture but i love this brand yoga pants they fit well and are not seethrough when you squatbend over these run a little large i normally wear a small for bottoms but had to order down a size to an xs i have bigger thighsbutt and normally cant even get an xs on the size small kept creeping down so i had to keep pulling them up all day very annoying switched to xs and they stay in place perfect,1
nice pants but the pockets are much too small i can barely fit my phone and wallet into them,1
these do fit a bit smaller if you like your pjs to be a bit roomy order a size up they are nice but not as soft as my other flannels wash them before wearing bc they are a bit stiff when you get them they are warm but not in a cozy way i guess i just like my flannel pjs softer and more plush i give them a 3 out of 5,1
ordered 4 pack of brown received a 5 pack of multi colored,0
great quality,2
this fabric is crawling with tiny little bugs got on my hair and clothes its made in china,0
says metal frame but its not huge and the clips would not fit over the lenses in spite of that we had to pay return postage rip off,0
great price super comfortable didnt need to break in as they didnt wear great price skechers also has a great warranty highly recommend,2
i have a 30 inch bust and dd breast and ordered and xs it was huge on me terrible sizing,0
had it sent it to grandson he really likes it,2
should have went to one of these wallets years ago dont even know it is there and fits what you need,2
really nice for the price but the words are upside down,1
the colors and design are extraordinary the weave is heavy which is okay for cold weather i suppose they are quality socks and others would probably appreciate the warmth the feel is not pleasing to me my preference is for a lighter sock in warm weather and a wool blend for cold weather,1
i had surgery on one foot last may i could feel the texture was too rough for the healing foot and i couldnt wear them,1
my son loved iti only hope it doesnt shrink with washing,2
these work for the price you pay but not the best hosiery socks ive found they tend to be super tight up around the top elastic but all wonky and twist easily in the shoe dont like having to remove my shoe a few times a day and straighten up the sole of the socks so you cant see the cotton bottom all twisted,1
i live in these great for working out in as well would definitely suggest them to a friend,2
theyre cute and comfortable and i like the color they do run wide though and because the material has give to it they dont support foot stability as much as i would like,1
met expectations,2
really happy with my purchase the color is the perfect taupe material is soft but i will say im a little scared it will snag ive worn it a few times with no incidents but we shall see the fit is nice i am 56 and 130lbs ordered a small the sleeves hit where they should and the length covers my behind so i could wear with leggings if i wanted,2
like all things that pretend to be unisex and one size fits all these did not fit my womans face well,0
the transition supposedly that they have does not even change to help block sun or lights,0
too transparent,0
ugly and ran in size huge when i ordered a size small,0
the pharaohs and nefertiti charms have animal like features with that being said i wont be using them the rest were fine and ive used them,1
material wasnt what was expected,0
great for those day you just need to layer up and avoid a coat keep you core warm and has a functional hoody easy to wear,2
looks like its for your wrist but its a belt for your waist,0
not flattering weird cut returned,0
i was pleased with quality of their shirts and boxer briefs,2
soft cotton not problem for sensitive skin,2
tipsy to walk in,1
good not great,1
im a cna and work 1213 hour shifts and my feet are killing me at the end of the day in these gave it 3 months looking for new shoes,1
these are definitely big bright and noticeable but unfortunately one has started to tear right at the hole after only one trip these didnt stop the ground crew from abusing my bag either,1
this is a nice shirt however arm hole are huge wouldnt be so bad if i was a 36 ffffff im 54 145 lbsbr its snug around the mid sectionbr long enough for me to tie it up on one end im using it for the gym so with my sports bra it wont matterbr next time ill just buy one from adidas website the returns are much easier,1
i just love this necklace i was so excited to get it and the first time i wore it it broke when i was trying to take it out i wish it would be more resistant is a shame because is beautiful,0
for tiny little people,1
these are super comfortable shoes just be ware they are made with memory foam and memory foam is known to cause many problems after continued use do your research carefully,1
i liked this one so much i also bought a smaller one to keep all my fine jewelry in it seems to be made of quality material and looks really nice inside and out the inside is especially beautiful with a plush lining there is plenty of space so you can see all your earrings etc clearly to choose from i love that it is stackable you can lay everything out if you need to,2
i ordered a size up because of other reviews but still rather small i was expecting it to be a tad looser its quite fitted im 510 so i do have long arms but the sleeves barely hit my wrists i was excited to wear this out but will just wear it around the house,1
looks nothing like the picture at all cheap material,0
just what i needed when working under the car,2
the ring is cute and comfortable but yellowed in 2 days,1
wish i had tacked the elastic before washing and wearing the wide waistband allows the wide elastic to fold spin and bunch up light cool fabric will allow colored or pattered under garments to show through to need to wear plane white grey or skin tone underneath,1
i really wanted to love this its honestly really beautiful but it broke within the first hour of wearing it so disappointed,0
theres always words written behind some peoples words makebr sure you read between lines also mother told me buy cheap get cheap,0
i was highly disappointed most of my african outfits like this are embroidery either by hand or machine it doesnt really matter this outfit looked good and it says that its a print but the print looked like xxxx i think its runs a little small but im big and so i cant call i do not like it i do not recommend do you thank you god bless you and may the rest of your life be the best of your life oz,1
excellent quality t shirt and graphic is bright and really stands out overall great t shirt,2
they sit kind of funny on my face and wasnt as large a frame as i thought it would be but it can be cute,1
this short is the perfect colorbright happy yellow perfect lengthjust long enough to comfortably wear with leggings and cover my rear perfect fitim got a medium since im 52 145lb 38b and a mother of 5until i washed itbr br then it shrunk and now barely hits the top of my hipswaistline it got short and the neckline and sleeves stretched all funnybr br i washed it cold with like colors but im a mom and busy i dont have time to be air drying a million things i buy clothes for practicality and ease of washing with the zillions of loads i end up washing a week and was disappointed that my beautiful comfy cute new shirt didnt fit like it used toobr br the words are still clear and the color is still bright and happy and fits fine around the torso except its too short now itll work for around the house but not wearing it out with leggings,1
i just received these yesterday i was a little worried about the pricequality of these cufflinks because there were no reviews but after seeing them in person i am very pleased the cufflinks feel solid and have some weight to them the weight might be annoying to some people thoughbr br it took a little over 2 weeks to be delivered to new yorkbr br update 521br ive worn these cufflinks 89 times with no issues but when i went to put them on today i noticed that one of the cufflinks is starting to fall apart the gold colored insert has detached from the casing the only thing keeping it from falling out completely is the winder this is unacceptable for cufflinks that cost 70,0
it broke right away the design where the buttons insert broke off and into 3 piecesbr im trying to superglue it i need a refundbr i was contacted by the seller and they are sending a replacement im hoping it will last a long time ill keep you posted,0
ok these are not thermal not fleeceso buy them if ya like the pattern color or construction but dont buy them for warmth period,1
this product was as described and was very appreciated by my daughter who spends lots of time outside in the winter it fits well is warm and comfortable and does not have a strong offgassing odor which i appreciate however after about 3 uses the elastic drawstring snapped off of the bottom portion of the hat so she can no longer tighten the lower face cover the hat is still usable but i would have expected the draw string to hold up much better,1
runs extremely small i normally where a large or extra large i knew it said runs small so got a 3xl but if you are large chested it will be tight around the bust,0
they are cute but not comfortable at all its actually slighty difficult to walk i buy 65 to 7s in shoes i purchased a 7 and used a thin sock my foot is snug but theres no half sizes so if i get an 8 thats to bigbr updated 1st order the zipper kept getting stuck n when id walk it was off track so i requested a replacementsame issue 2nd shoe zipper opens from the bottom and you have to put it back on the track n try rezipping im gonna get refund n send back,0
all around this is a great item and for the price i do recommend it the specially ordered surgical garment i had to get originally was a size l and fit similarly to this one i wear about a size 10 jeans am long waisted 59 and larger bone structure and i think after wearing this one a few times i might be willing to try the l but it would be a snugger fit i even slept in it with no discomfort i like the center zipper with adjustable hook closure underneath which is easier than a side closure the only thing that i might suggest to alter is the hook and eye closure at crotch be replaced with snaps or better an open crotch instead the hooks can sometimes be a little uncomfortable when walking around anyway nice quality shipped fast and comfortable fit overall so i give this one five stars even with the hook closures at the crotch,2
love these shoes fit great they dont last as long as i would have liked but i wear them everyday,2
100 recommend this top i ordered the red but will be ordering more colors its true to size and so cute in person,2
nice sunglasses for the price,2
this sweater is not slouchy or large enough in the neckline to be worn off the shoulder the length i would describe as cropped hitting above the hips and it is more fitted than it is loose,1
love them bought as a replacement for the walmart deck shoes i wear around the house as my homage to the sainted mr rogers these shoes however are a full size too small im a 105 purchased 11 and they were tight front to back put in the shoe stretchers two days later theyre good not great so if youre looking to purchase roomycomfy over tightmaneuverable order a full size larger again love the shoes just wish i went for the 115,2
hella cheap and was worn down when i received it,0
great quality super cute great metal used as well,2
arrived quick and was as advertised,2
its pretty but it feels a little flimsy it wobbles when you open it not as heavy as i was expecting,1
not worth the money rolls up as soon as you put it on will not stay put,0
they fit perfectly and he put them on immediately they are a big hit,2
no me gusta que la parte delantera de la zuela resbala un poco,0
too small need two sizes up to fit like picture,1
keeps you warm its soft and color exactly what picture shows,2
this jacket is accompanied with a chart i took my measurements and came up with a medium for the size i need jacket arrived 3 weeks late it was folded up and all wrinkled and when i put it on the sleeves were very tight at the wrists like wrist bands my wrists measure 2 14 inches and are very small and i could barely even zip up the coat the chart is a bogus measure jacket has a nice feel and style but order the next size up if you buy thisbr i would return it for exchange but it wont come until summer,0
very happy with purchase,2
lightweight yoga pants shipped in a zip lock bag easily viewed and opened by anyone pants were wet never received a package through amazon not in a secure white bag suitable for returning an item,0
bought this for a bridal shower gift second try on amazon but had to return it because it had some black tarlike gunk on it i also had to return the first set i bought for the same bride because that one had a stain gave up on buying from amazon and got something from nordstrom fortunately it was fine and the bride loved it some of these things on amazon are tempting because they are pretty and they are cheap but theres a reason they are cheap beware,1
i bought this for a trip to china my spouse and i had four suit cases and used all four strips when we arrived china direct flight two stripes were lost and another two were very loose already on the way back again we tightened the left two strips both of them got loose i dont recommend this products for traveling it doesnt work at all,0
this dress is maxi perfection the bodice is a lightweight stretch knit the skirt has a silkysmooth touch and has stretch the empire waist is elasticized you could add a belt for cinching i found the fit to be true to size for fit reference im 56 153lbs and a 34g bra size im wearing the mediumbr br thanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier,2
ok,1
the bulk tag cost seems out of synch with the cost for small numbers of tags but overall a good deal,2
i like it but one of the links broke and now it is just 2 necklaces in one,0
first and foremost the packaging that this device came in was in perfect condition sadly when i ordered this thing i wasnt allowed to choose the personal size that i needed unfortunately its too small and its too short for me and thats even after addressing the straps on the sides and everything else where there were straps to a just im not sure whats wrong or why its so small and sadly i have no way of shipping this thing out or getting to a location where i can return this particular product i also no longer have the original packaging so i cant ship it back unfortunately,0
really nice looking very happy with the quality look and speed of delivery,2
bigger than expected seems like mens cut,1
i love these earrings i expected them to be a darker blue they are perfect for decembers birthstone i would differently gift these,2
look great and are polarized and im not worries about losing a 200 dollar pair of glasses,2
i love this dress the fit is perfect,2
great gift for my daughter she loved it no problems with the seller or shipping,2
se ven tan elegantes,2
the product was and is what i expected at a very reasonable price,2
it came torn and dirty,0
this dress was perfect and fit as expected it ripped in two separate places within the seam the very first time i wore it i was disappointedas i had to leave the event i was attending due to my dress being torn i will be returning this product with the expectation of a full refund i wish it would have been made of a better quality,1
the bust of the dress is way too small to be an extra large,0
looks great but it often falls off,1
so cute,2
i bought these for my cartilage piercing and they are too small to close around my helix,0
tarnished within a week i do not recommend it it now looks coper in color not gold,0
i love this necklace and i get so many compliments when i wear it but its falling apart after only wearing it twice the quality is very poor and it shouldve been cheaper to buy,0
cheaply made would only but it for a gag gift,1
just what i needed for my son simple works stays up,2
its okay,1
runs way too big,0
red jacket color is a darker red kind of a slightly tepid red not very attractive,0
i really like them but i wish they werent see through,0
the bra in this top is not made well the elastic under the bra line is cheap and does not provide support the pants have a shiny tacky look thumbs down on this one,0
terrible quality outer layer is some sort of plastic glaking off after 2 months of use,0
like swimsuit,1
very cute and warm,2
i received the coat and it was as described the coat fit well except for the sleeves they were much too long compared to some of my other coats of that size i gave it to one of my children who has longer arms then i have,1
material felt cheap and thin,0
i bought these thinking they would be like zutano but cheaper well they were cheaper but as weve learned with baby stuff you get what you pay for i returned these never even put them on my son because they were scratchy and thin,0
a little small,2
i wear a size 4 in womens i ordered a med these things didnt come close to fitting me,0
i realize this bag is made super cheappoorly however i did expect it to last longer than a few weeks wish i could return it as it has fallen apart and isnt worth even bothering to try and keep fixing the pieces just fall off randomly save your money and buy something better thats my recommendation,0
our little one obsessed with little mermaid even tho older character and show it is still magical for the kidsbr just got this to surprise our little one it was an absolutely the right move to get this she loves itbr good quality fabric soft and smooth well done seams does not rip off it is pretty durable wife definitely agrees that this is a great bang for the buckbr br top portion could have been made little bigger and more adjustable it is little tricky in current design,2
great price for this bra but the sizing is incorrect i ordered my usual size 34c and this one came and is more than 2 bigger around more like 36 than my others so now i have to wear it on the smallest hook which means when it stretches out as they all do it wont fit anymore disappointed,1
i ordered this one for high school prom and it didnt fit well its always hard to find correct size online,1
thick tough leather,2
the shoes are pretty but very uncomfortable no give across front strap will cause sores across top of foot,0
dislike the print job it looks bad up close far away and online looks better expected vinyl or better quality screen printed and blotchy print br still rock my arsenal pride but disappointed in quality,0
i love my shirt,2
nice detail,1
when you first put these on they are soft and luxurious and you think that youve found the perfect slipper but after wearing them for a week you feel like they are getting bigger and then after a month they fall off your feet and they are no longer soft and warm and luxurious the faux fur mats down and compresses and you might as well be walking barefoot for all the support you are getting its sad because when i first put them on i loved them and thought it was the best thing ever but even after washing the faux fur and padding doesnt bounce back and look nice and feel nice its just all compressed and matted down and ugly the outside of the slipper is nice but the fluffy inner lining is now crappy and uncomfortable and wont keep your feet warm let alone fit and support your feet comfortably,0
the front shade is a little long i am looking for a short one so that it look better please make one that is not long or short still good for the way they make it and cool n comfortable,1
beautiful ring my better half wore it for 3 days and one of the setting prongs bent and the stone fell out i found it 3 days later and have to take it to a jewler to be properly reset,1
want to send them back and they want me to pay postage to england,1
not parrot proof,1
very disappointing if i could give a lower score than 1 i wouldnot at all what is advertized,0
impossible to put the ball on it rubbed my lip sore and made a line indent in my lip that bleed buy cautiously,0
mini mini dress or blouse,1
cute top but to short for me nothing like the girl modeling it its a crop top,1
finally found some womens socks that are comfortable and stylish,2
i needed something bigger,1
its cute but baggy and doesnt fit to well i sized it an it still was to big,0
very cute and comfy i ordered the graypink geometric print not see through like other customers mentioned the fit is perfect shipping could have been a little fasterbr im 55 and 125128lbs and the small fits a little loose,2
this didnt fit not even almost the sizing runs small,0
cute earrings but very thin they bend easily backs also dont stay on very tight so they fall off easily,1
these earrings are so small theyre for a child or a doll very disappointed,0
im usually a size 6 so i bought a small but it was way too tight definitely too tight to fit a cami under i recommend going up one or even two sizes its a cute top but i had to return,1
too small,0
did not care for the material,1
its nice for the price only wish the neck came down farther and it wasnt as tight seems more of a youth size than grown man,1
this is a nice little jacket did pill on the sides after a few washes i wore it quite a bit this summer the color was pretty close to the picture,1
this is the first of many of pattys tops that doesnt fit as expected its very soft very stretchy im just going to exchange itbr does anyone know how resilient her rayonspandex shirts are to stains,1
love the fabric very soft and stretchy love the ruched sleeves and sides,2
these shoes are attractive and offer excellent support,2
exactly as pictured and exactly what i needed for a golf tournament,2
for a 2000 coat its okay,1
nice,2
ordered in 24 months and fit my older son who is a size 34 the fitting us awkward the shirt is very scooped and low in the front the shorts look like balloon panta or harem pants the design will peel off in 23 washes as in it wasnt screened on properly overall poorly made and not recommended,0
you get what you pay for 5 boots dont stay on baby feet so i couldnt even use them for pictures dont waste the money,0
super cute i normally dont buy clothes here but this was awesome i dont regret purchasing,2
be very careful these socks are very slick on the bottoms i ended up falling down a flight of stairs i am going back to dr motion alittle more expensive but the bottoms are not slick,0
tha ls,2
this is a very bulky watch that has not been received well by my daughter i knew it was a low quality watch but this is way worse then i expected,0
im 5534 130 lbs i usually wear a 56 i opened the first pair and wore them one day they seemed super stretchy and comfortable not too bulky but not too thin but i took them off at the end of the day and there was a one inch hole in the crotch where the seam gave way im not super active i work from home its not like i was trying to do yoga in these so one star for qualitybr but i called amazon customer service and they were excellent about fixing it by having me send them back there were still 3 pair never opened because i was afraid they would be the same quality and they gave me a full refund i want to give amazon 5 stars for handling it but im supposed to be reviewing the product not amazon so 1 star it is,0
i brought this dress for an event im so disappointed because i havent either wear it and i notice this torn in the backworst bad ever,0
you will not find better quality than these shortsbr my son is hard to fit a big and tallbr he loves these and lounges in them and goes out in thembr they are casual but nice enough to wear outbr wish they made them in my size mombr these are pefecto,2
wore it once washed it and it was covered with pulling very cheap fabric there it in the trash with the other one i bought,0
very good quality,2
doesnt fit as shown its a bit large and looks cheap,0
i thought they would fit my thighs better but theyre amazing once i use them with my garter belt i pair them with a skater skirt and they look super cute,1
fits well except there plastic so breakage is expected,1
eehhhh super tight not as i expected dont know if id buy again,1
order 1 or 2 sizes larger than you normally would i ordered 1 size larger than i normally wear and it is still a little snug on me,1
it was the perfect replacement for a tent bag that the zipper broke its a coleman 8 person tent with a foyer so its a big tent and everything fits inside this bag with room to add a ground tarp and more stakes granted stakes dont take up much room this may not be what you intend to use the bag for but if another car camping tent bag malfunctions im getting another one of these,2
i purchased these specifically for shopping at aldis a grocery store that does not use bags this has made shopping trips much easier as things are organized the bags are high quality and durable even with heavy groceries the handles make them easy to pick up and carry they fit great in the shopping cart they fold down easily to store in your car or carry into the store the shipping was slow but i knew that it would be before i ordered as they arent primebr br as for the negative when you put them in the car the sides fall down so your things in bags are no longer in bags so you need to rebag at your car or have groceries rolling around the trunk also the fabric is rather thin but after one trip it has held up great if i have issues with it after extended use i will update my review to include thatbr br i purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review i like these and i am glad that i purchased them i would recommend these for shopping i like that they are environmentally friendly if you shop at a place like aldi without bags these are a great thing to have,2
very cheap,1
this jacket looks nothing like the picture it is huge shapeless and boxy and it was a mess because it came in a tiny little package and was so crushed up there would have been no way to straighten this out its going back immediately,0
these are robust and relatively wide though they seem pretty 4e to me for a 5e shoe when i really need an 8e that cannot be foundbr theyre not comfortable and i get blisters in them when walking long distances not matter what i try to do with laces a problem i do tend to have but can normally sort out by adjusting thingsbr i wanted shoes that lasted longer than the nb shoes i normally have to buy because noone else makes shoes even remotely wide enough but these arent wide enough are uncomfortable even compared to other not wide enough shoes and have generally underwhelmed me they do seem to be built to last but thats the only thing keeping their rating from slipping furtherbr they appear to be as waterproof as they claim,1
perfect fitting,2
was too small i will be returning not for tall girls,1
this is solidly okay its thick enough material length is good pockets are nice the issue really is that after a couple of weeks of waring these the waistband began to slip down and i own a ton of leggings and this is the first one to ever do so i wouldnt buy againbr br edited to add so when the black leggings were kind of a miss i looked up the other leggings i bought that fit great turns out it was the same company and leggingsonly it was in the splinter camo it fits perfectly and the top doesnt roll down at all now the black i purchased more recently does look through the reviews seems to be a theme the black might be made differently id give my splinter camo five stars the black 3 stars,1
these are great super comfortable and are neither too tight or fall off whether i am wearing socks or not not sure if they are washable or not though,2
fits perfectly,2
shrink crazily,1
its not strong easily broken after one use,0
im 36dd and i ordered a large i spilled out of the sides i gave 2 stars for the material being soft,0
i did not like this product and i dont think i will wear it,0
package is missing the necklace bracelet and stockings that were listed in the description,0
quality and sizing is excellent on these fitness topsbr be aware that they recommend air drying,2
missing a gem in the moon,0
these come down around the balls of my feet and continue to almost my toes ive worn off the shelf clothing for decades im not an odd ball so either what i received is an abnormal or theres a qc issue by the producer and follow up by those who sell these in the states just saying i do otherwise like them but will soon take the scissors to them so theyll fit,0
rubber too hard,1
it took a long time to get here but im satisfied with my purchase it fits nicely and i love the tie detail on the sides i would recommend this product,2
my daughter brought this for her and her friends they all love it its a nice and a sweet gift to give,2
disappointed my dress arrived on time fabric quality is on ok but there is a long visible sang hanging from the right breast area other than that the dress would be 34just ok34 but this big thread makes the dress ugly if i saw this dress in a department store i probably wouldnt buy it do you have a product checker,1
great dress for work and fits me pretty well it is slightly big one me so i just wear a belt with it i have muscular arms and a curvy frame and this dress looks great im 56 127 lbs and 27 inch hips,2
i really wanted to use this because i love the color and style however the coin zipper gets stuck and is hard to open and close which renders this wallet completely useless,0
i love this tank top i love handstands so much so this was perfect for my upsidedown world the fabric is soft and durable the length of it is so perfect and fits my physique very nicelybr thank you for creating such a fabulous tank topbr br fits true to size im a medium through and through and this fit perfect,2
this product is nice and a great alternative to the oem combi however as others have mentioned the spring bars were very hard to get seated this will likely be a no go for most skill levels unless you are fairly determined and have multiple spring bar tools and lots of patience that being said i like the feel and it certainly seems to be well attached now no movement of the end links whatsoever and functions as it should i am not sure if i would buy it again due to the difficult footing and installation,1
looks good with flaps up or down,1
horrible the material is awful its like paper dont waste your money,0
i bought these in 95 following reviews but even in 95 my usual size is 9 in sneakers like this it was small you can probably get by but your toes touch the end of the shoe i am not sure if its roxy or not but roxy sizes are very different anyhow size 10 fits perfect so that will be two sizes up,2
is good,1
washes well and wears well too,2
i wasnt going to write a review since i ordered the yellow stone and they sent red but the earrings are nice and going to keep them,1
theyre a great look decent pricebr the top strap very tight the adjustable strap is only for the heelbr the arch support isnt at the arch is off towards outer side backbr would not wear for any length of walking,1
while the description says yellow youll be surprised by it being orange they need to say this is orange not yellow its comfy with the memory foam and sturdy i wear a size 6 and bought the 665 but its too small i mean i guess it fits if you squeeze your toes all the way up you can say it fits but no so go a size up definitely go a size up if you plan to wear socks with it too apparently i wont be able to or my feet will most likely fall out other than that everything is fine plain and simple just like what i wanted,2
its soft has nose wire roomy where it needs to be goes under chin easy to wash good buyworth it,2
they looked way cheaper in person than they did in the pictures they were very flabby and looked like they would fall apart after wearing them for 5 minutes i returned,0
i like everything about this cardigan except little too pricey looks so stylish and feels comfortable and warm got lots of compliments wearing it,2
didnt think they looked genuine all iron on looked kind of fake to me sorry,1
great,2
i bought this because another review said it would be great for maternity wear and i always like to buy stuff that i can use after baby is born as well i love the color of it and it is very soft and i can tell it will be comfortable in the hot summer months that being said it is a little short on me and i did size up do to other reviews recommending it i will either wear it with leggings or as a beach cover up so i am still going to keep it but if you are 56 or taller be prepared that this may not sit as a dress for you,1
i like these pants they are way to long for me so i have to wear 3 platforms so they dont drag the ground,1
it kind of large and the end of the sock is low quality but overall its good,1
ok somewhat embarrassed to say i have now bought 6 of these they fit true to size so order accordingly i am 56 132 lbs and medium is perfect experimented with a small and large large is fine for lounging at home small would be fine unless you have any belly these are not real heavy not too light the style is cute and they are very very comfy and soft the green with stripes on the arms is my favorite,2
purple is not as dark as the picture,0
i ordered a small and it slides up and down my arm a small should of fit perfectly but it does not make sure to go a size down,1
i really love this swimsuit it fits very well the color is beautiful i have received several compliments on it the one thing that i wish the designer had done is to make the stomach lining the same color as the swimsuit when the dress part floats upwards the lining is exposed and the white color really stands out otherwise this swimsuit is wonderful the dark prussian blue color is what i would describe as teal and it fits true to size i did originally order the black one which seemed to run smaller i am 57 and weigh 200 pounds with a smallish chest and ordered the xl i highly recommend this swimsuitbr br update august 2020 i have been wearing this swimsuit for about two months and its begun to stretch in the back its still wearable but is starting to get a bit loose up top it is obviously not a swimsuit thatll be good for more than one season,2
cool look but was hoping they were swimming trunks they are not read the fine print when shopping is my lesson,1
this dress is quite large despite ordering a small,1
23 for two pieces of plastic and a rubber bandbr ridiculous i returned it immediately,0
i was hoping to get a 46b with cups that fit but these bcups are more like ccups or even bigger otherwise the bras fit nicely,0
cheap and feels bad on skin,0
this shirt fits nice and has a really cute back with buttons i probably would have given it four stars but the one sleeve is missing the hole for the button see pictures,1
this is a great carry and conceal bag for everyday use and even has pouch on the front for an extra mag it has belt loops so you can carry it on your waist without looking like a modern man gone sissy fanny packs great for carrying compact single stack 9mm like the kimber solo in shorts with a belt during the hot summer without drawing attentionbr i sewed in some velcro to that holds the weapon at the proper angle for rapid deployment my wife whom also carries has the same setup but with a 380,2
awesome shoes i wore them hiking in the mountains they are a little warm but not uncomfortable they are very padded and feel very well made the traction is great i wore them hiking across mud and rock and did not slide they fit my feet just right,2
the dress is see through and the material it was made with is disappointing the way its made and even the color does not match the picture on here waste of money honestly,0
these are perfect for being outside on hot days then are light weight best dorags i have found,2
smaller than i thought,0
the pictures dont do this anklet justice the turtles are larger than they appear the chain seems nice and strong not thin like other anklets ive hadbr my only complaint which isnt a bad thing but dont understand why they did it is that each separate turtle is covered in protective plastic its so hard to get each turtle uncovered i had to work and rip it using a more pointy part of the turtle to do it luckily they turtles are stronger metal and didnt bend or breakbr this looks so nice on my ankle,2
i normally wear a 2xl figured i would order a 4xl this hoodie runs way too small and tight,1
dress is pretty but sheer with large arm holes suitable as a beach coverup or to wear around the house,1
i like the white ones they are the most accurate to the pictures the green is bright in the pics but are so dark its hard to tell they are green the brownish ones in the pics are dark but they are more of a carmel hazel color irl,1
i am a size 85 womens got the medium and these are way too big they are baggy on every part of my foot and makes it difficult to do pilate or barre because even though the grips are good my foot slides in the sock,1
this is not a mens shirt its a youths shirt i ordered it for my husband because he loved groot but was so disappointed that the shirt was small enough to fit my 13 yr old grandson even though it was an extra large please watch out for the descriptions,0
this thing looks good but is a lot bigger than i expected it to be hanging from a jeep rear view mirror it nearly touches the dash would love to see them make a version that is 23 long,1
i would with the mittens to be on elastic band rather than just a fabric one,1
i ordered this dress for wine tasting and my boyfriend proposed this dress is tasteful enough to be more formal but still had a casual feel im 55 and 130lbs and bought a small the fit was good and because its a wrap dress you can determine how tight or loose you want it this dress is also solid and you cannot see through it i would highly recommend,2
the dress is well made and well stitched the fabric is slightly stretchy and lightweight pleasant to the skin the cape like sleeves are attached to the shoulders while the dress fits true to size i look like overstuffed sausage in it even while wearing shapewear it shows every single roll and imperfection i have and i have to tell you it does not look attractive at all plus the lower part of the dress keeps rolling up my legs and gather at the apex of my thighs when i walk in it i am in favor of body positivity but unfortunately imo this dress would look smashing on a slender willowy body rather that curvy heavy boned like mine,1
they are great,2
i cant express how much i love these pants theyre so soft and comfortable that i ordered two more pairs in different patterns and even though i typically wear them at home with a tshirt it would be easy to dress them up a little and wear them out and about highly recommended,2
the color of these leggings is nothing like what the picture and description described them as the color is 5 times lighter than what you get,0
runs smallbr had to return it oncebr no issues worked great and warm,2
im not sure if its too boxy or what but not my favorite for sure,1
this your offbrand tshirt with a print on it the picture of this product is an official futurama one but in reality its homemade in china,0
this is a weird accent bracelet came quickly and were perfect,2
the costume arrived within two weeks which was faster than the month it said it would take and came in good shape aside from expected creases the material is cute and detailed the bets way to describe to ensemble of pieces is that it was thoughtful the ganyu cosplay comes in a lot of pieces with a lot of accessories so its easy to put on and adjust im always an xs but referenced their sizing chart just in case to find xs would still be the most accurate option for me when trying it on though the bodysuit was tough to pull over my calves because the lower part of it has little to no stretch no problem stretching around my thigh but the tough part was starting to pull it around your legs the main part of her costume is like a velcro skirt piece and it was super baggy on me and making the skirt as tight as can be on the little piece of velcro made it look uneven and still baggy in the front right under the bust the bell sleeves might be too tight for others as well for me they were perfect but if posing like with a bow it kind of pinched my upper arm the gloves were big too but they were mostly hidden by the sleeves so it shouldnt be a dealbreaker i love how this set comes with anklets like for her shoes because that saved me money in reusing a pair of white heels instead of trying to remake hers they were however super big honestly i could not wear them without sewing adjustments because they were very loose and slid right off all in all though if you know how to alter clothes or the basics of sewing you can really make this costume work but otherwise i cant promise how well her costume specifically will fit because for me the sizing was all over the place i will update with photos,1
a little too bulky rather have a smaller one,1
its sad because i am soooo in love with this ring but it broke after a week,0
very effectively keep my granddaughters feet dry and warm while she enjoyed the snow in west virginia,2
this dress fits exactly as it should but material is way too thin u can see right through without look hard have to send bk,0
last for a month poor quality,0
color was not at all like the picturebr had 2 holes in the pants,0
set fits small and the pants are fairly short i ordered an m thinking the sizing would be smallish but shouldve gone with an l,1
deformed not good quality,1
i only wish they were non slip if you have all carpet product will be perfect,1
its ok not for me looked better in the picture i have it away,1
