worldnews,oh i agree his attempt to blame the gulenists for it has more holes in it than a swiss cheese but this in itself is evidence that the coup was legit because if erdogan staged it to incriminate the gulenists why did the coup leaders completely avoid all gulenrelated rhetoric or behaviour leaving erdogan to make up the links afterward if the aim is to fabricate an excuse for a crackdown on gulens sympathisers wouldnt it be way simpler and more effective to stage a pretend gulenist coup rather than staging a pretend kemalist coup and then trying to claim it was really gulenist i think erdogan unintentionally provoked the coup with foolish actions and has clearly exploited it to crackdown on his opponents but the idea that the coup itself was entirely his plan just doesnt make sense it would require a remarkable combination of the greatest deceptions the world has ever seen with the kind of errors that a threeyearold could point out,0,1

relationship_advice,you act like after a certain point life experience stops or something by your logic of life experience it should be just as predatory for a 45 year old to date a 30 year old the reason is internalized misogyny you see other women your age as delicate and pure and needing protection whereas 30 year old woman come off as weathered and jaded so they dont have a need for that protection they are assumed to have lost their innocence already with their youth its a fucked up worldview to hold gtat 30 youve also completely matured completely wrong and being financially established is dubious at best maybe true 20 years ago but not any of the more modern generations the situation seems like casual dating he isnt paying her rent or having her move in with him gtbut it does sometimes raise red flags when you see someone barely out of high school dating a much older person because you believe that choice is made because she is in some way damaged or has daddy issues which ties right back into the sexism nothing about the relationship has any red flags to our knowledge i looked up the stats because if this thread roughly 10 of relationshipsmarriages are with a ten year or more age difference which means this isnt even that uncommon just something reddit gets adamant about gtim a 20 year old girl but in ten years when im 30 i would definitely feel predatory if i went after a 19 year old boy you wont know that until you actually are 30 btw you are just assuming thats the case because thats what society has told you growing up you probably wouldnt even consider dating someone younger than you since society frowns on that alot but thats not necessarily the case,0,1

gameofthrones,really just because hes killed white walkers in the past doesnt mean hes going to be the one to kill the night king there were a lot of other skilled fighters in the main cast who had could easily have been in the right place at the right time most of them had valerian steel weapons or at least dragonglass weapons which might have worked too their stated battle plan was for jon and dany to circle back and defend bran with their dragons and for theon to be guarding him it couldnt have been a twist if dany or theon ended up killing him because they had specifically planned for that eventuality as soon as bran gave arya the dagger everyone on reddit was talking about the possibility that she would kill the night king then when arya got another weapon specifically made the idea came up again she was asking gendry for specifics about the enemy so she was definitely thinking about killing white walkers,0,2

asoiaf,i think the issue is that you forget that the enemy is capable of their own plans 1 the army of the dead was in no rush they could just wait it out let a few starve and turn them they had shown before and during the battle that they could wait the living did not have that option 2 again a siege would be an automatic loss for the living 3 the artillery was generally useless you had equipment for sieging a castle being used to try to kill off a few before they got to the castle also would have been useful if the nk waited it out but in general not much use and the lack of artillery shells seems to indicate the same 4 how much time was there to produce dragonglass tipped arrows as they were more effective than the fire arrows especially after the storms came it also gets into how many bows and capable bowmen were there 5 much like 1 in general you had open field cavalry specialists you are fighting a swarm type enemy that would render the horses useless you also have no idea where the enemy lines start or end the dothraki were in some ways there to make sure it was a battle and not a siege by initiating combat 6 once again the army of the dead could just wait it out like they had already shown with the lake freezing i get it everyone looks at the battle from a generic standpoint and thinks the living had a great deal more options than they did some arguments make it sound like they had months to prepare others ignore the unique abilities of an army of the undead the truth is that they didnt explain the whole theory beforehand which makes the subtle implications harder to understand when they did like sansas comments about food there was a flood of wtf is she talking about food for comments,1,0

leagueoflegends,gt neeko who is a young magical girl who is curious which is beneficial in an educational setting zoe who is a younglooking magical girl who already has animeesque interactions with ezreal yandere zoe plz annie if shes allowed to be a little younger sona who is another young magical demacian girl just like lux thats all just off the top of my head the thing is that neeko came out in december being apart of the battle academia skins is a bit early for her to get another skin zoe is barely on the edge for there maybe having been enough time passed she just got a skin in july sona got a skin in september do you see the problem here they all recently got skins amp the problem with annie is that shes just too small to shoehorn into a highschool it wouldnt be believable at all not to mention annie as your stereotypical best girlwaifu if that doesnt sound terrible because shes a literal child it should because annie is just downright scary its really easy to take older characters and make them seem younger as in most media people consume you have a 20something or even 30something year old playing a highschool student even then there are limits to who can fit in without looking too out of place amp gt i mean id love a star guardians taliyah skin but at this point its starting to feel like shes just getting luxs scraps i mean the original star guardians came out in 2015 which is before taliyah was even a thing the second round was in 2017 just a little over a year after taliyah was released but these skins were likely being planned for quite a while before then since taliyahs release lux has only gotten elementalist lux lunar empress lux and then pajama guardian which is just her star guardian skin in another outfit hence the reduced price i cant really see how her ending up as a star guardian would be her getting luxs scraps there are only two possible skins of luxs that she could have technically filled the role of lunar empress and the upcoming battle academia amp im sure theyve been planning their next cast of star guardians for a while now likely as long as theyve been planning this event it just makes sense to me that they would look at all of the female champs and try to figure out what makes sense to put where lux and all of the other previous star guardians are disqualified for one skin line off the bat theres only so many champions that are going to be a good fit for sg i get being frustrated but i just dont really get taking the frustration out on champions like lux that definitely help bring in boatloads of cash that let riot make more skins for champions that need love riot has been doing a really great job of making a skin for these kinds of champions and theyve promised to kill even more of these 1000 day club memes i trust that theyll continue to make good on their promise and in the next year a lot of the 1000 day club members will be knocked out,0,1

MortalKombat,gtthis is where it gets subjective to me obama looks half white and half black and jcole because he looks like a regular lightskinned black dude to me they both look as black as people like john legend and pharrell gtafrican american is a stupid term and i dont use it its easier and more accurate to just say black africanamerican is specifically meant to denote black people with longstanding ancestry in america essentially the descendants of black american slaves because they are not the same as black people from other nations and cultures you could also call them black americans i guess but it doesnt really matter point is they are not to be grouped with haitians or jamaicans or dominicans or nigerians or whatever else they are their own people and culture like how white people can be white american or irish or german etc all black peoples are not the same and thats why i have specified africanamerican or black american multiple times in my comments gtthis is some logic and math that i agree with ill give you that considering the average black american may only be 75 made up number african heritage so this argument makes sense this is really what ive been saying since my second response to you though that black people already have admixture so a mixed person often can and will still be considered black because theyre already pretty close to what means black in the usa and in many cases there is no visible distinction,0,2

politics,what i am more worried about is that he is indicted when he leaves office why because trumps entire presidency is a road map for how to break america how to play the role of a populist to turn more and more of our nation into an autocracy this is a road map someone will follow again if not the next president or the one after that or the one after that someone will use it with more nefarious intent than trying to con the government out of money and to try and slap the trump brand on the white house a future president that wants to become a king will take every step trump has made and use it to do so trump fails because he is an idiot and lacks in any sort of long term thinking beyond the next fox  friends tagline or tweet so what will it tell this future american dictator this future manwhowouldbeking that if you break the law if you violate the constitution if you surround yourself with criminals  corrupted actors then the best way to be safe never leave the white house and you might think thats not possible the 22nd amendment prevents someone holding more than two terms but thats not how it would play out a future dictator might declare a national emergency refusing to hold elections due to some manufactured issue they might declare that the entire election process was corrupt with millions of illegal votes they might say the entire election was a power grab by their enemies in the opposing party and the media if you cant imagine a future president saying these things and getting away with them then you havent been watching this president i dont want trump to get away scott free but i feel it is imperative to our democracy that he faces retribution and judgment for his crimes before he leaves the office otherwise it sets the alltooclear precedent an acting president is completely and totally above the law as long as his party stands behind him,0,2

worldnews,the trump campaign was spied on thats not in question what he asked was was it appropriate theres no problem spying on the presidents campaign or anyone else for that matter provided the proper rules are followed and its for the right reason the steele dossier is a problem not because it was circulated per se but because it was circulated without mentioning what the source was and considering what the source was thats a real problem if youre using a document that was commissioned and paid for by the opponents competitor and may not be accurate and you use that to get permission to spy on someone from a judge without disclosing that thats potentially a significant problem and leakers should always be charged unless they can demonstrate extreme circumstances or justification whistleblowers,0,0
leagueoflegends,mages being viable and sometimes picked    thats what is played and the best picks for the role perkz mainly played adcs this split perkz has played very few champions that werent adcs so no it doesnt really matter that much that he is better on mages than dl it definitely isnt enough to put him above him on the standings the best and most picked champs are adcs its an absolute joke to have perkz that far up and above people like doublelift also teddy is insane on mages and bruisers bot lane and he has proven that against the very best bot lanes in a way more competitive region so no it isnt even that cut and dry that perkz is the best mage player playing a mage bot lane isnt the same as playing a mage in the mid lane match ups matter a lot and he definitely doesnt have even half the knowledge that the other ads have he is completely reliant on mikyx and what hed know about the game g2 being good and having better solo lanes    perkz is better than dl if perkz was still a mid laner id agree and argue that he even needs to be ranked even better but he isnt ranked as a mid laner he is ranked as an adc and as an adc that is a joke ps caps also carried more games than wonder and got the mvp interested to see how wunder managed to be rated above him same goes for faker who didnt even look that good this split pawn slapped him around so much in the playoffs he just didnt have the teammates skt won but pawn definitely outperformed faker even with the last game where faker redeemed his previous games teddy got robbed big time,1,2

AmItheAsshole,yta im sure this will be an unpopular opinion but ill try to unpack it as best i can i want to preface this by reminding everyone that we arent hearing his side of the story which is half of the story also this is the internet and its fairly anonymous so its almost a guarantee that some of this info is exzaggerated there are plenty of things that could be going on here 1 hes worried about your health  i highly doubt this is whats causing this so im not going to address it 2 hes trying to convey the message that hes losing attraction to you because of your physical state you can take this two ways you can take it as an attack or you can take it as him trying to help you fix a problem between you guys before it becomes catastrophic the problem being the loss of attraction the same way a girl never says kiss me she plays with her hair and scoots closer to you and expects you to figure the rest out youre not getting the hint so hes taking it to extreme measures to convey it and its in the realm of harrassment now ill let you decide where the blame lies there because you obviously know your sitiation better than i do i have no idea 3 its an attempt to get you to embark on this journey with him this is the one that really made me come down with the verdict of yta there are a multitude of women in your exact position but instead of their husband getting them a gym membership they just get cheated on hes bettering himself hes attempting to help you do the same and even cooler do it together and youre offended by this it seems to me you need a bit of a reality check because believe me it could be a lot worse and i think the most important thing to note here is that everyone is always preaching about how your aignificant otherspouse should always accept you for who you are thats a bunch of disney nonsense any relationship should be a collaborrative effort of mutual self improvement and compromise good luck finding any successful relationship in history that doesnt involve those things the fitness thing might just be one of those things that he wont budge on just like one of my exs things was that i had to save more money instead of sending it back home to my family was she an asshole for demanding it no its just part of who she is the decision was still mine just like its yours will you make the sacrifice for someone you declared your life partner or not pretty simple,0,0

movies,lets be honest the first order entirely fucked up the events of tlj snokes ship comes in launches an entire fucking fleet of resurgent class star destroyers and not one not fucking one interdictor interdictors for those who arent scifi wonks are ships that are meant to prevent other ships from going to lightspeed to escape and they were numerous and plentiful throughout legends and they were introduced to canon in rebels and several comics at about the same time two years before tlj did that matter to rian nah he was so dedicated to having his ww2 bomber scene that when he remembered he was directing science fiction he used an attack that physics says that would be the most effective unstoppable attack that real physics can create outside of destroying a star but he entirely overlooked interdictors now instead of a catastrophic loss the rebels cripple the biggest flagship ever created and wipe out the majority of the first order fleet now either every notimperial fleet must have an interdictor or theres absolutely no reason for the rebellion to not just take a few hyperdrives out of their derelict cargo ships and strap them onto asteroids and launch them into the first order fleet for a superweapons worth of damage they also wouldnt need big engines at that velocity even just a few hundred thousand tons of mass is enough to break a small moon in half it doesnt matter what the mass is if its an asteroid a ship that can be sacrificed or not then theres the disappearing knife in the throne room scene that would have killed rey if it hadnt just vanished now there isnt all bad things to say about that the luke vs kylo ren moment is quite possibly one of the best introductions of a hero to save the good guys in all of star wars i dont even mind that luke is a force projection or that he even dies since he said earlier that doing something like that would be fatal i like that luke went out heroically saving his friends and his successors the music too is incredibly good its the only part of the movie i really truly love without even a shred of a complaint lastly i adore that a skywalker is finally the big bad guy snoke was nothing but a cheap palpatine expy that im glad that rian killed off that was a fantastic betrayal scene the overall movie though absolutely awful canto bight was a blight and it felt really disingenuous that i was getting a wealth corrupts speech from a fucking disney movie the chase scene was the worst executed pursuit scene in any scifi medium ive ever seen rey gains way way too much skill way too fast the blender joke in the throne room fight scene resulted in laughter around the room turning a life and death fight into the pulp fiction scene where vincent shoots the passenger maz shows up for thirty seconds not to explain why she had the lightsaber or why she knew that it was calling to rey we still got zero explanations for the hosnian system being the one targeted admiral ackbar died for no reason and the constant bathos succeeded in killing the suspense in all but two major moments there were good fight scenes in it there were great moments and the music was absolutely spectacular a skywalker is finally the big villain in star wars but the way we got there was not rewarding,1,1

asoiaf,gthis is not true based on what we have seen in the show the nk himself either wants or is compelled to strike the final blow the nk is also shown to either want or is compelled to specifically go to the 3er but why this is what i have issue with we dont really have a compelling why and the character is dead i was left hoping for some extra explanation but i think this one might be addressed in the next episode gtjon didnt fail the directors claimed that jon failed but i dont see him interacting at all really with the villain associated with the story hes in even the jons actor was surprised to not face him not to mention there wasnt even a fight scene with him and iirc the nk actor is pretty skilled in mock combat i suppose you could probably write this one off as an unexpected deviation from the books but the whole ptwp prophecy seems very much a waste of time either way the point is the narrative is unfulfilling gtit is nitpicking that doesnt hold up people have a subjective feeling about the show and are grasping at anything they can to justify it first ill address the nitpicking the subjective feeling is culminated logically its part of how shows and good art work they spent like 8 seasons addressing this building up story lore etc they then ended it with an anime leap in a scene that didnt make sense from a character with no story relation while setting up the expectation of the jon vs nk confrontation with the last scene with jondany that episode was made to built up the expectation of said confrontation only to shatter it with arya stabbing the nk for shock value any serious complaints about narrative should stem from issues with this gtespecially given that many similar military issues exist throughout the show and that even the basic combat isnt all that realistic similar military issues exist throughout the show but for a major battle scene youd expect them to improve ive seen this battle hyped up on social media as the greatest battle in cinema history and it didnt deliver my main point was about the nk and the cavalry charge i think youre largely on the money with most of the griping being unjustified but i think youre pretty wrong about the brannk plot and the cavalry thing gtcavalry vs unarmed and unmounted enemies would normally be a slaughter see stanis vs freefolk no one was expecting a tsunami wall of dead the enemy has no weapons the enemy has no projectiles they wouldnt need support vs anything normal or realistic light cavalry in actual military history doesnt charge unsupported theyre for flanking maneuvers and shock tactics if used in actual battle the dead certainly had weapons see danydrogon scene being swarmed scene and there was no advantageous weaponry being used on the cavalry side that would make up for that arakhs would be great if the enemy werent effectively armored against nondragonglass weapons but arakhs are weapons meant for doing damage with surprise charges the infantry didnt have any weapons with reach which makes cavalry much better on a flank but it still isnt really enough to make it a smart tactic the lack of projectile thing would come into play if the dothraki actually used their projectiles but for some reason they decided to charge into melee youre very wrong about the stannis vs freefolk thing its made very clear that 1 stannis used heavy cavalry which is great at riding down infantry light cavalry is useful on the flank but is pretty bad for a head on charge note that the dothraki are not armored heres a quote from sos because its easier to quote than the show but it also happens in the show gt east and north and northeast he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight but the attackers rode right over them the free folk still had the numbers but the attackers had steel armor and heavy horses 2 stannis also had the flank he came in from behind the formation the books and show both emphasize the cavalry coming from the eastern flank with them also flanking with rangers from the north in sos 3 stannis also was using the cavalry to flank and shock the opposing army its emphasized when the freefolk break there is no hope for the wights breaking 4 the freefolk werent generally in formation and the formations they did have were poor any assembled at the last minute tight formations particulary pikespearetc formations are one of the only ways infantry can expect to win against heavy cavalry id say the dead seem pretty tight and act in this sort of way youre right in that the dothraki should have done better but they also shouldnt have charged in with arakhs a weapon primarily used for cutting down infantry on the flank head on and instead should have used their bows but i think the show forgot that in real life military history a head on light cavalry charge has always been considered suicidal iirc theres even art about that concept theres not really many notable instances of light cavalry charging using melee weapons other than lances etc the whole point of dothraki is that they can ride downthrough enemies on the flank they even consider this a bad tactic but do it anyway against the unsullied i dont know how anyone can think that the dothraki could ride through the hordes of undead even the smaller ones we saw at hardhome contrast this with the head on attack with light cavalry against enemies that can survive blows in favorable conditions for the infantry it makes sense that they would need some support to divert some attention from the sheer area of infantry that can repel a charge on contact light cavalry are great for cutting down enemies that arent looking that way but not much if theyre able to be confronted i just cant see what was supposed to happen them charge magically kill the front line with few injuries repeat ad infinity i also dont buy the whole very few people have seen them as essentially the entire population who have battled them are there for input at winterfell  is this substantive enough support i want to advance this one beyond what others are considered nitpicking but i realize that not putting support seems condescending and wrong a great portion of enjoyment from got is the attention to detail and foreshadowing i think this leads to extra critical consumers who engage in those things so i think some level of what would otherwise be nitpicking is justified also feel free to correct me i only took a few of these courses in undergrad and am by no means an expert in irl military history,0,2

unpopularopinion,the thing about coming into a class late is that is a disruption even if youre doing it quietly as possible unless its a huge university course held in an auditorium style room people are going to be disrupted by your entering late its 1520 min into the class lecture is going full swing everyone is trying their hardest to keep up writing down what the teacher is saying someone enters the classroom late the door opens they come in and have to put down all their stuff and take their seat to some that is just a quick distraction just a quick glance up to the door acknowledging someone came in late and then going back to what youre doing but not everyone can do that to the student in class whos suffering with severe adhd youve probably cost them the rest of that lecture because theyve lost their focus and all they can think about now is the sounds going on why youre late why theyve been late in the past and then its just a rabbit hole of unrelated thoughts not to mention that its going to throw off the teacher and cause them to lose focus and to be honest a large part of it is fairness everyone else made the decisions and the planning to be able to get there on time they committed to coming to class on time so they wont be causing a disruption for their fellow students and their teacher and lastly its just rude being late is rude it shows you didnt care enough about the event to make it a priority to be there on time it shows the teacher you dont value their time or the information they are providing you and it shows your peers that you believe the rules dont have to apply to you i personally always admired the teachers who would close their door after class began and wouldnt open it after regardless if someone shows up late if youre not going to commit to it and be there for the whole thing you shouldnt be there at all you signed up for a class at this specific time and thats the only time you should be able to collect it if you took that 8am class but hate waking up early and often show up late just know that there was probably someone who wanted that time slot who needed it to be able to work or have time with their family who would have shown up on time every day and wasnt able to take the class at that time because there werent any seats left your being late may not effect everyone in that classroom but it will effect some and it could mean that youre taking an opportunity from someone else who would love to have it and are then wasting part of it,0,1

unpopularopinion,sigh i dont know if you are deliberately misrepresenting the facts but i will proceed on the assumption that you are just misinformed here is the entirety of the quote sanger reiterated the need for black ministers to head up the project in a letter to clarence gamble in dec 1939 arguing that we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members this passage has been repeatedly extracted by sangers detractors as evidence that she led a calculated effort to reduce the black population against their will for a better example of her views check out her real actua unedited words as she wrote in an initial fundraising request to albert lasker she simply hoped to help a group notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a caste system that operates as an added weight upon their efforts to get a fair share of the better things in life to give them the means of helping themselves is perhaps the richest gift of all we believe birth control knowledge brought to this group is the most direct constructive aid that can be given them to improve their immediate situation not racist realist as for your condescending pearl clutching over the number of black abortions i ask youwere these women forced to do this why are you assuming that black women cannot make rational decisions for themselves african americans have higher poverty rates than just about any other group of americans those in poverty tend to get more abortions wheres the conspiracy,0,1

aww,gtgood enrichment is actual social and environmental enrichment that mimics an animals natural environmentthats the whole point of enrichment interacting with humans doesnt do that thats a very purist idealist idea of what constitutes good enrichment in most cases its simply not possible to even come close to replicating the animals natural environment the point of enrichment is to enhance the quality of captive animal care through providing the stimuli necessary for optimal psychological and physiological wellbeing that can often involves activites that require interactions between the animal and its caretakers and like i pointed out before animals that are more comfortable around their caretakers are more comfortable in general of course there are both wrong and right ways to do it my point is just that not all interactions with the animals being cared for are unwarranted unbeneficial or unneeded for instance the aazks suggested guidelines for bird enrichment states that operant conditioning can be a rewarding form of enrichment over time birds can learn to respond to a number of cues and commands animal training programs should be well thought out and have attainable goals,0,1

news,gt but weve seen these systems abused in the past especially in universities where innocent kids have gotten expelled due to accusations that later turned out to be completely fabricated gt gt if youve sexually assaulted someone you deserve to go to jail dont tell me you sincerely believe 1 criminal convictions eg for death row never wrongly punish the innocent and 2 no institution should be able to issue any punishments short of imprisonment gt even if theres not definite proof theyll often fire someone to avoid negative pr that gives far too much power to accusers and it will be abused as proven by the systems in unis meanwhile rampant sexual abuse is an open secret in institutions across many fields and industries but yeah that parts okay so well ignore it as weve always done gt that can often take years though by the time youve gone through the courts your name has been smeared already youre unemployable and everyone has forgotten about the specifics leaving you with a terrible reputation the innocence project exists which shows that already happens in legal systems all the way up to death row convictions so lets drop the trite act of no employer should fire anyone for any kind of sexual misconduct unless theyre literally on their way to prison for it because i supercare about all the false accusations that totally happen all the time everywhere and courts are perfect,1,2

AskReddit,1 it wasnt a derailment you posited that because so few black people identify as republican that is proof the party is racist i offered an alternate reason that isnt offtopic 2 you requested i give you the name of a black republican who could be elected by the party as president now youre saying that is just tokenism 3 you said the republicans would never elect a black person as president but there only has to be one black person who could be elected as president to prove thats not true youre now saying one or two isnt proof of anything the truth is the only way for me to prove that there is a black person that can be elected president by the republican party is for there to already have been a black person who has been elected president by the republican party otherwise you can always just say that person would never get elected without obama youd be in the exact same position with respect to the democrat party obama was the most talented politician weve in decades  had he been a republican i think he would have been elected president as a republican but if youre going to just ignore my arguments and keep shifting the goal posts there isnt really much i can offer you,0,1

asoiaf,i mean we hardly actually saw it happen for fans that claim to realism where people die horrific deaths sansas scene was not very graphic i think peoples emotion for sansa overrides what we actually see which is a torn dress and her head moving then a pan to theon as we hear her cry they established a lot without having to show ramsay literally ravaging her which i feel like was more delicately handled than people give it credit for for all the discussion above stating definitively that dany was raped by drogo emilia was crying and almost fully naked in her scene and getting violently thrusted at whole sobbing fully in center frame theres no comparison the sanaa scene was emotionally brutal sure but visually it was a fairly calm depiction of a violent act by thrones standards that said still makes no sense for sansa to do the jeyne poole story line in the first place,0,1

gaming,they literally can not possibly compete with steam if the games were on both store fronts if you had a choice which one would you choose every single time even if egs improved to the point where its actually competitive with steam youd pick steam every time because thats the platform youve used already for this long because thats the platform you have all your friends on because thats the platform you have all your games on they would have to put years of work into developing their storefront to still not be good enough for most people they do want to make their platform better theyve been working on it and its seen a few improvements keep complaining about it and itll keep seeing improvements they have to do that in order to keep people for the games that arent epic exclusives which is revenue they are also aiming to get they have to do it for the same reason steam had to do it for years despite not having competition but to expect the level of quality that steam has right now after well over a decade of continued development as a storefront is kinda ridiculous complaining about it is fine claiming that its unusable and is a massive burden to the consumer is ridiculous you already likely use origin uplay bethesda launcher gog galaxy or whatever other launchers in order to play something but its epic that is the problem all those other launchers that host games that arent on steam or are but still require you to launch the launcher anyways you dont mind them theres tons of them but you hate epic specifically for the reasons that youll give the rest of them a pass on its fine to complain complaining is good it gets the company to improve their product but the claims people are making about epic are straight up hypocritical irrelevant or untrue most of the time i will complain about the shortcomings of the egs but ill also purchase and play borderlands 3 because the storefront has nothing at all to do with my overall enjoyment of the game ill purchase and play metro exodus because the storefront has nothing at all to do with my overall enjoyment of the game and your refusal to use the epic storefront also has nothing at all to do with my enjoyment of these games so keep circlejerking away ill enjoy my games on a functional storefront that does enough but still could use more despite that not providing much if anything to my gaming experience it functions and thats enough for me because its been enough for me with other launchers that ive had to download to play some other games too i didnt riot then and im not going to riot now,0,0

soccer,because spurs fans watch all these players over the course of a full season son is a great player and hes stepped up this season at important moments when other players have been out of form or unavailable no one denies that but its just incredibly irritating when people who dont follow the team and how it performs come in with these boring hot takes about how hes actually the best player based on the few moments they see no one speaks about the numerous games every season where son is too selfish in front of goal where his touch is completely off where hes not afforded space and then looks out of ideas you could argue that son at his absolute peak is better than the other players but when hes not hitting that peak hes far more likely to pass through a match anonymously without creating anything substantial and without contributing to spurs control of the match or general level of play eriksen and dele especially are just essential for driving the side forward and creating opportunities,0,1

gameofthrones,to those defending the fate of night king it seems the main argument in justifying his demise is that many seasons ago melisandre told arya about the brown blue and green eyes and so everything that happened in s8e3 has a perfect fit with that prophecy and other more recent events like bran giving a the dagger but the blue eyes didnt have to be nks his generals zombie kids giants practically all the undead have blue eyes for that reason her killing the nk wasnt a clear writing on the wall if you ask me but okay if she was promoted to this role then dampd should have at least made the act of assassination convincing not convenient a scenario i would have accepted as plausible is if arya assumed a stealth position in the tree above bran or if she carried out an attack using crossbow or some other ranged weapon instead she is shown flying from the side where a thick circle of wights is meant to be they couldnt sense her in the library hiding around the corner fine but this scene is different in terms of topography there are no nooks and crannies in the godswood how arya was able to sneak past the crowd unnoticed is a question that dampd didnt bother to answer some would call it nitpicking that ignores the bigger picture for me its these kind of small things that made got great the early seasons at least lack of attention to detail plot convenience bigger emphasis on graphics than story line sloppylazy writing all have ruined the show imho,1,0

unpopularopinion,gtnot only that guns are essential to ensure that the other liberties are protected the government should always fear its people not the other way around thats the way the founding fathers intended it the founders were so concerned about the prospect of america regressing back into a totalitarian government that they specifically wrote in the constitution that the government is to be made up of individuals to serve the needs of individuals this was written in a time when the only real advantage a tyrannical government would have over citizens is manpower and organisation so realistically a gathering of citizens was a decent match nowadays they have far superior tech eg planes tanks etc that citizens dont posses so it wouldnt even be a contest therefore really guns are not at all required by citizens as any potential uprising could easily be crushed even if citizens had guns,0,1

soccer,some of my general thoughts after watching the game  llorente is a bottom half of the championship level striker hes simply awful so crap he offers spurs literally nothing yet daniel levy is so cheap he refuses to invest in the squad in the way that would be nessecary if he wants spurs to actually be competitive at this level your not gonna win shit with llorente up front the fact that swansea deemed him not good enough says it all yet spurs have him playing in the champions league semi total madness  trippier is awful he looks a totally differentand worse player to the one he was at the world cup what happened to him  eriksen had a really bad game eriksen is so ineffectual most of the time but everybody acts like hes world class but imo hes very overrated and he seems to have a regular habbit of going missing and being anon in these big games  likewise deli ali also is similiar to eriksen in that regard hes just as ineffectual most of the time but everybody acts like hes world class although hes even more limited amp waaaay selfish with the ball  spurs have no strength in depth this is their problem  spurs medical staff need to be punished and face a review for their incompetence and negligence in allowing vertongen back onto the pitch i mean he was clearly out of it and not fit to continue with a serious headbrain injury etc to be honest rugby is waaaaaay ahead on this issue football should learn amp copy rugbys approach also potechino needs to have a good look at himself for going along with it as the mwnager he should take some of the blame but football needs to look to rugby on this issue and as a culture and sport football needs to start taking brain injuries seriously  i thought for all the hype i really think ajax were not that good yes they played some nice stuff in the 1st half but spurs made it waaaaay to easy for them as spurs looked afraid of the ball and were awful in the first half but i ajax really were not that good despite the ott hype  neres is not very good and is it just me but does anyone else think neres is on something i mean he looked crazed af yesterday doped up to his eyeballs  after what i saw yesterday i think ajax are very beatable and spurs should still be able to do win in amsterdam ajax defo are there for the taking so those are my thoughts,0,1

relationship_advice,this was utterly horrifying and honestly depressing to read so im extremely sorry that you ever had to go through this and are being push to the point of questioning yourself worth because of this man and his cheating and addiction problems if he never had a history of cheating before my thought is really just that his addiction got the best of him that doesnt mean its an excuse or that its okay it just means that drugs seriously alter a persons desires and interests tom obviously knows that this is not something youd be okay with so its not like he could go around you and get high and i guarantee he once he started getting high with her she probably offered him drugs for free and they would smoke each other up or shoot each other up depending on what kind of drugs theyre into theres so many reasons why this all happened and probably even more significant reasons of why he even got into drugs in the first place if he normally wasnt into them or had decided to quit prior but the most important thing i think you should recognize is that it has nothing to do with you theres nothing that you could have done to prevent this or make him want to come to you about it unless you altered your morals and principles which you should never have to do as soulcrushing as this entire thing can be and as cliche as this sounds you truly are better off and will be in a better place with time please just understand as i reiterate this again this had nothing to do with you it doesnt make you any less worthy it doesnt make you any less beautiful it doesnt make you any less significant it just makes him an asshole,0,0

leagueoflegends,yeah i think so too im not a toxic player simply because its limited to text chat otherwise i might have a few restrictions under my belt lol i have the unpopular opinion that simple trash talking or harsh criticizingblaming is fine for the game not healthy or unhealthy draw the line at personal insults spam or racial slurs and the such when youre in the setting of a competitive game where youre stuck with players who are putting you down then it should be okay to talk trash as long as what happens in each game stays there maybe im thick skinned though to appeal to a bigger playerbase riot doesnt want to deter children who are naturally thin skinned from playing so it makes sense to combat toxicity the way they do i used to play call of duty trash talk and raging was fine for the game because it was rated m and children shouldnt be playing it,0,1

unpopularopinion,you have no fucking idea what youre talking about and you sound like a misogynistic asshole youre really going to sit here and teach me a woman how to masturbate and the reason i cant achieve orgasm without a vibrator on my clit is because im just fucking lazy the reason women struggle to have orgasms compared to men is because evolutionary wise make orgasms are essential to reproduction where as female orgasms are nearly irrelevant so of course its easier to men to get off and of coyrse theres some women who will never be able to orgasm and many others who require something much stronger like a vibrator im a college level biology teacher this is fact its not because inherently lazy but glad to know im talking to someone who thinks that little of women but essentially now youre arguing that 12 year olds shouldnt be allowed to orgasm if they cant through their hands because youve decided that means theyre just lazy and if they really wanted to orgasm they could but they dont theyd rather wait until theyre nearly 30 on average to have their first orgasm and thats why 12 year old girls should be allowed to use a clitoral stimulator btw whats wrong with taking the easy way out while masturbation from now on me as a woman with a vagina has decided that all men should no longer masturbate using their hands because thats too easy and all men are using it as a crutch and theyll never be able to masturbate without using their hands if they keep using them men using their hands to masturbate is just them being fucking lazy and they dont actually know anything about their own sexuality or body because theyve relied too heavily on their hands does that not sound like the dumbest thing youve ever heard,0,0

asoiaf,gtyeah that is literally the point i was making she was following visions and her actions did not need to be directly related to the end result for her actions to be meaningful she wasnt a plot cheat sheet she was part of the plot she follows her visions and yes the visions do have to be related to the end result because theyre literally prophecies for the savior of mankind you missed the part where the whole world of ice and fire has this prophecy for the ptwp and all these magical people claimed it was either dany or jon mel was even able to bring jon back because her god has a plan for him weird how she had so many visions from her god about jon but none about arya the world established that she can be wrong when they referenced stannis then her magic came back when she started backing jon snow thats the point she messed up with stannis and finally found the true prince that was promised in jon snow shes part of the plot everyones part of the plot its not much of an accomplishment the plot is what happens the story is why that stuff happens and the why needs some serious explaining for this episode again she strolls in and goes against all her previous proclamations without showing the audience an actual vision and she negates all the foreshadowing that has established the world of ice and fire up to this point not only that but if she didnt specifically tell arya it wouldnt have happened thats a pretty shit hero that needs to be reminded to save the day gtshe wasnt a plot cheat sheet she was part of the plot youre acting as if people think shes going to tell them exactly whats going to happen thats not what i was even commenting in the first place the person i commented essentially said that she can be wrong about stannis and jon and choose arya and the writers excuse for this really convenient writing is she can just misinterpret all the visions thats not an excuse its lazy writing you dont throw away everything that has been foreshadowed when you try and subvert expectations amp for the longest time dany was the clear ptwp she fit all the property in the beginning of the books before jon was even like the main character but slowly jon started fitting more and more of the prophecy and now he fits just as much if not more than she does thats subverting expectations amp everyone thinks itll be dany will sit on the throne but not putting her on the throne would subvert that expectation having her and jon rule together would also subvert that expectation amp gtthe arcs were not subverted because they ended in unexpected places or just for the sake of misdirection they were just not going where you thought they were and you need to rectify that on your own you dont subvert arcsyou subvert expectations holy shit imagine if cersei dropped the whole queen thing to become a fisherman or joined the nights watch ltbut subverting character arcsgt amp a characters journey cannot be subvert that implies you can change their direction at the last second characters change over time and with their experiences you cant think to surprise an audience by making a character make an out of character decision its confusing and bad writing for example cersei is not going to start being the loving queen margery was its out of character for her arya is not going to suddenly become girly like sansa was and start focusing on finding a husband because its out of character amp again subverting expectations is following the flow of the writing writing that has been planned out ahead of time as well as having the characters do what they would actually do if they were real people but throwing some twists in there see my example above for jon dying to the night king dragon fire or jaime dying in a battle and arya taking his face to kill cersei having cleganebowl but having them kill each other i know its a popular theory on reddit but it subverts the expectations that our boy the hound will win because hes a good guy now having dany trying to take kings landing first and then having her when shes about to win decide to go help jon at winterfell or wherever again the night king out of guilt for not helping him first and out of love having everyone hide in the crypts and foreshadow that the crypts are full of the dead obvious and that the night king can raise the dead making the audience think its a dangerous and dumb idea and then not having that happen or having the stark dead become wights like benjen stark sentient and alive but also dead and then they fight for the living amp that is subverting expectations this is how you follow the path the show is on and throw some curveballs at the same time,0,0

news,i mean sure in an ideal world but one of the big reasons why legacy admissions is such a big deal is because alumni are more likely to donate if it means their kids are probably going to end up at that school too if a school isnt big on legacies a lot of the time it gets way less donations and the quality of education for everyone else suffers for example i go to a top uc school and were incredibly in debt and if we were getting more donations then maybe it would help alleviate that but the fact is we dont offer legacy admissions so people are far less likely to donate since their kids are that much less likely to end up at that school also i dont think guaranteeing entry for multi million dollar donations necessarily tarnishes a universitys status either since there arent that many millionaires or more rather billionaires out there to make a real tangible impact on the number of unqualified students getting in,0,2

gameofthrones,yes its complete bollocks all around real medieval cavalry in siege situations would keep the horses inside the castle until an opportunity arose then open the gates sally forth wreak havoc get back in the gates now its pretty clear this wasnt going to be a siege story for one thing the attackers dont even need supplies thats a pretty shitty attacker to face a completely logisticsfree enemy and being numerous enough to swarm things like ants doesnt help either what that cavalry needed was some open ground along the enemys lines of advance miles away from the castle some dothraki emerge here some dothraki emerge there some zombies give chase here and there some zombies move in wrong directions and waste time instead of forwards towards the castle and to the extent the nk cant keep concentration on everything some zombies actually get picked off in the rear by failing to move forwards but this is a story about military tactics and the writers clearly didnt want to write that if they even understood it at all i find that the push for character drama in a large ensemble cast often sidelines big picture widespread phenomena like accurate military engagement over space and time a correct story about winterfell would have been the dothraki have been out in the field harassing the zombies for a long time and that their numbers are dwindling due to attrition,0,2

apexlegends,camping has nothing to do with shitty aim some people find it fun take me for instance i learned to camp in ut99 playing sniper only dmtdm find a spot pitch a tent wait anyone not patient enough and moves around well theyre exposed now and theyre dead it was fun so i kept camping in other games like cod and battlefield etc finding a good spot and waiting can almost be exciting and the payoff is second only to when youre slowly stalking someone in game waiting for the best opportunity and you finally get it like in bf5 i killed maybe 7 people in my spot while defending a bomb my team placed and i held the enemies off long enough that it went boom the rest of my team dead should i have went fuck it bro camping is for pussiea with shitty aim and stood out in the open and died after the first kill or 2 i get thats a different game for that example but my point now with rambling included for no extra charge is that camping is more a playstyle than a crutch some people dont like it some do some hate it only because they get killed by campers then the same camper in the same spot again then the same camper and then the same person again when theyre blindly rushing the camper to try and kill them in a fit of rage the camper loves this even if they die after 5 tries theyre feeling awfully smug with themselves at this point,1,1

funny,i think its definitely different and not lower standards both sides i think want the samesimilar things but prioritize those things differently amp that said i will say that while i am open minded having only been a man and growing up with certain stereotypes in the mediait sure seems as though we males are always horned up and ready to go and we have to work to get women to say yes where as a female just has to bat their eyelashes a bit amp social stigmas probably dont help things either stereotypically for a guy losing his virginity is something that must be done asap and is a moment of triumph and it doesnt really matter again stereotypically who it was withbut girls are expected to keep theirs for as long as possible and give it to someone special basically men sleeping around are skilled players and women doing the same are sluts and get shamed for it this probably feeds into why women dont seemingly want it as much as guys seemingly do because theyll be looked down upon by a society that expects them to behave differently amp i dont think its purely psychological and social stigmas though i mean its not uncommon in animals for males to do certain acts to attract a mate essentially with animals males are often ready to go with anyone and are just working to get a female to say yes where as the females are being picky so maybe its just genetic amp you would think with either evolution or intelligent design it would be a good idea to have both sides be super into it and ready to go to keep the population up evolutiongod dropped the ball s,0,1

relationship_advice,the problem ampnbsp did you know that any form of anxiety is actually fear of the future meaning that social anxiety is nothing more than your mind assuming negative outcomes to social experiences that may or may not happen ampnbsp people get anxiety because once theyve decided they want to do something they begin thinking about all the things that could go wrong ampnbsp what if she doesnt like me what if i say something stupid what if i dont have anything to say what if my breath smells terrible what if i have something in my teeth what if she already has a boyfriend ampnbsp our minds are great at doing such things and these types of fears are the things that keep us from achieving greater feats in our lives ampnbsp the funny thing about anxiety though is that through our emphasis on all the negative potential outcomes we lose our sense of logic in any given social interaction especially with strangers there is always about a 50 chance that things will go your way and another 50 that things wont go your way ampnbsp because of anxiety your mind is entirely focused on the 50 that wont go your way the more you focus on that 50 the more discouraged you feel because you arent reinforcing yourself with the other 50 possibility of positive outcomes ampnbsp ____ ampnbsp a solution to your problem shortterm ampnbsp you say youve got 4 days left until you possibly see her again so for the next 4 days instead of thinking about all the negativity involving her ill regret not speaking to her etc what youre going to do is tell yourself 3 things twice a day for the next 4 days ampnbsp  im a confident and social person  i love striking up conversation with new people  people are drawn to me and my openness ampnbsp say these 3 things to yourself once in the morning when you wake up and once before going to sleep you can do it more if you like and really the more you say them the better ampnbsp what these statements will do is get your mind in a positive space youre too weighed down in your own negativity and anxiety right now so all youll continue doing is growing more and more afraid of speaking to your crush because all youre thinking about is how afraid you are how badly shell react and how much regret youll feel for not speaking up you need to lower those negative feelings ampnbsp next youre not going to jerk off for the next 4 days i dont know if you watch porn or masturbate but if you do quit it until you see her again this point may not be as well known but when you refrain from ejaculating the sexual energy builds up within your body ampnbsp your behavior changes and you become more expressive confident and bold why because when you dont release sexual tension and energy its built up and you feel that energy throughout your body your body realizes it isnt getting to release and makes changes within you to help you reach that release either through higher sexual urges wanting to watch pornmasturbate more or improved social skills better eye contact more comfort in your own body more expressive and open to communication ampnbsp that all may be hard to believe but seriously do it if im wrong youll be free to come back and call me out my name and blame me for the failure ill take responsibility ampnbsp ____ ampnbsp a solution to your problem longterm ampnbsp this is more advice for whatever happens between you and your crush its important to understand that while anxiety is caused from overthinking negative outcomes to your decisions the negativity wouldnt persist unless to some degree you believed what you were telling yourself ampnbsp selfesteem and confidence are two very big aspects to social interactions that will literally lead you to success or failure its important to have both however i understand its not as simple as telling someone to gain selfesteem and confidence so id like to give you long term applications thatll help you develop your personal image of yourself ampnbsp confidence in social interactions come from experiencing success in talking with people selfesteem in regards to socializing comes from continued success over a period of time until youre able to build a reliable image of yourself and your abilities in socializing ampnbsp a reason a lot of people have low confidence when it comes to socializing is because they experience negative social interactions that leave them emotionallymentallyphysically hurt they then use their past experiences as a reference to whats to come in the future and remain in fear of continued hurt and pain in future social interactions anxiety ampnbsp another reason a lot of people have low confidence when it comes to socializing is because they dont have any past reference to draw from when it comes to socializing with others they simply dont know how to talk to people and are too afraid to try because again theyre stuck in their own head and focus on all the bad that could happen if they fail ampnbsp in either cases the solution in a 2step process ampnbsp 1 you need to build up your confidence in social skills by learning how to properly be social with people and by learning i literally mean learn how to socialize i used to be a painfully shy and quiet kid in middle school it was so bad id hide in the bathroom stalls during lunch time because i didnt want to embarrass myself in front of anyone now i can hold conversation with anyone male or female and bullshit with the greatest bullshitter the greatest path i took to get me to that point was picking up the book how to win friends amp influence people i learned many fundamental points to interacting with people and learning how to start carry and maintain conversation with people i learned the importance of eye contact being curious about the other person and being a great listener my confidence came from knowing what i knew from that book 2 you need to build up your selfesteem in social skills by applying what you learn in regards to conversations socializing and being around people i had already felt more powerful having the knowledge from the book but i still needed to actually go out and apply what i learned you dont have to go balls to the way right out the gate though for me the first thing i did was improve my eye contact id try and make eye contact with people i walked past sometimes i keep the contact more times id look down or away over time i got better and better until it just felt natural to look people in their eyes next id try saying hello or giving a nod to people i walked past this was easier because id more often choose to just nod and remain silent lol but over time i got bored with nodding and opened my mouth i continued this process until my success far outweighed my failures and i just started socializing with people more surprisingly a lot of people started striking up conversations with me the success of this built my selfesteem until im at a point where i can comfortably say gt now i can hold conversation with anyone male or female and bullshit with the greatest bullshitter ampnbsp ____ ampnbsp i dont want this to get too long so ill end it here for now if you have anymore question feel free to ask,0,2

marvelstudios,youre lucky cheering at a movie is pretty stupid and ruins it,0,1
movies,first half of this film was so slow and crap holy smokes time travel was a poor way to go about it why not just show mistress of death and bring in adam warlock now why are we waiting for guardians 3 to see adam warlock its so stupid iron man death and black widow death were predictable as they both said personally they dont want to do anymore of these movies i also think the ironman death could have gone a bit better and extended pros of the film were the last quarter i guess of the film the battle scene was very good and well done i enjoyed that lack of captain marvel in my face every scene which i expected did not happen so again very good the humor in the last quarter was also very well done before that it felt extremely forced and i never laughed at all the main gripe for me is this amazing comic book lore they had at their disposal and literally all they used from it was the gauntlet thanos and the gems nothing else rest of it was just hollywood script made up people might say its predictable if you just follow the comic book lore but that isnt true because their is a large population of people who have seen this movie and have no idea about the comic books at all oh well 610 for me just because of visuals so many superheroes everywhere and decent fight scenes but so many questionable moments and a 6 might even be a bit high for me,1,0

AmItheAsshole,ok so two points on that point number 1 learned behaviour a learned behaviour such as shoe chewing becomes learned because of the association between the action and a positive reaction having that constant reward mechanism will get the animal to continue to perform that behaviour this is the basis for pretty much every good method of obedience training as well as behavioural addictions in humans its why i cant spend a day without being on redditgoing cold turkey effectively breaks that association and forces the body to learn other pathways to get that dopamine reaction this means the dog is more likely to perform other behaviours to get their rewardsub point i put quotations around positive what you intend to be a punishment to stop the behaviour such as shouting at a dog is not always perceived as such and youll find a lot of good trainers may tell you to ignore attention seeking behaviour as the reward is your attention even if you think youre providing a negative reaction the dog sees the attention as a reward instead point number 2 the cause of the behaviour it is also important that the cause is actually rectified the dog does have to have an alternate source for that reward if the dog is bored its going to go back to the behaviour however if it finds an alternative source for the reward it will stick with that alternate source this might be a more direct reward such as a kong where the action provides a reward or a less direct reward such as simply something else to do so yeah i did vastly oversimplify it is more than simply removing the opportunity for behaviour and yes i also train owner behaviour which is designed to get better dog behaviour a dog is 247 not just when the owner has time for it you dont complain about needing to shut a gate you might have otherwise be less attentive with why complain about not leaving shoes where a dog can get to them whilst you correct a behaviour also im 100 convinced that positive reinforcement methods encourage a far better relationship with your dog that positive punishment training positive reinforcement doesnt leave your dog associating you with the punishment,0,1

unpopularopinion,you mean the wizarding world i honestly think the problem here is the lack of people that have ever really been interested in the potter series for its storywhich is bad because its a book series first and foremost with the fantastic beasts series and specifically the crimes of grindelwald we found out that most people arent invested in the wizarding world for the stories rowling writes which are incredibly complex well written thematically rich and emotionally potent but for tangential ephemera like hogwarts houses and quidditch when you remove these elements completely people visibly just dont care about this series and its story and thats noticeable some of this is down to the substantial knowledge gap between book fans and film fans casual viewers for this franchise are extremely casual and view these films because they look cool and book fans like the films because they expand on rich detail and imagery from the books in the case of crimes of grindelwald it was plotted like a novel and that proved way too much for the casual moviegoing audience who irrationally panned it that being mixed with the substantial amount of predetermined hatred that crimes of grindelwald notably struggled with i think its a more mature complex and stylistically noteworthy wizarding world film than the first fantastic beasts and nearly any of the potter films but unfortunately its falling prey to vacant ignorant unintelligent and outright meanspirited criticism that mainly stems from an extreme lack of investment you have people pussyfooting around the fact that what theyre essentially doing is criticizing the film for its complexity and intelligence because its boring all of these melodramatic criticisms and strawmans being thrown against the film are people performing mentalgymnastics and twisting words around to try to avoid stating that they dont like it because they just couldnt follow it and found it boring which arent damning allegations tbh theyre trying to make it the films problem when its really just down to their utter lack of investment predetermined hatred or laziness look its fine if you found it boring but to all of a sudden act like worldfamous mystery novelist rowling is trash at writing because you couldnt follow her story is beyond arrogant especially considering those types of allegations are coming from dumb people i also know for a fact that the negative buzz is being boosted by people with no vested interest in this storyfranchise or who even outright admit to hating it its being denigrated by people who insist we just need to be extra hard on prequels and people who want this franchise to fail all of the criticisms ive heard against the film are simplistic imputations melodramatic hot takes and clearly predetermined insults its being panned by people who are even deliberately twisting the films events to suit their aggressive and inaccurate hot takes people ignoring the craftsmanship people calling rowling a dumb bitch panning the entire film because they disagree with a plot point whining that its boring or too dark or making a huge deal out of minor problems relating to editing or the fact that its not a standalone narrative its utterly ridiculous and yea 100 invalid turns out most people didnt really care about this film at least in america and they didnt see a problem with blindly hating it,0,2

relationship_advice,its up to you what you do disloyalty is very common and monogamy is hard work this doesnt have to be the end of your relationship but thats up to both of you to figure out grief is no better an excuse for infidelity than anything else as adults were responsible for the consequences of our decisions getting drunk with friends of the opposite sex and hooking up with them is the same whether were sad happy grieving whatever if youre in a monogamous committed relationship then thats irresponsible unfaithful behavior she came clean to you and apologized  so obviously shes feeling a great deal of guilt and remorse she should have just stayed quiet about this and never told anyone by sharing what shes done shes seeking forgiveness shes shifting her guilty feelings onto you its understandable on her part but still the immature move personally i dont think id be cool with something like that my partner and i have discussed this sort of thing and we both are pragmatic about the risks of alcohol and have agreed to try and be forgiving if one of us slips up were not open but were willing to forgive a slipup however its one thing to be drunk with friends and have something happen in the moment vs spending a bunch of time with a family friend and then something happens after a night of drinking together that suggests some concealed feelings that finally bubbled up thats not so much a random mistake as a shortterm affair its not a good sign and you have to decide whether your trust is broken relationships over in that case,0,0

trashy,gt but i dont really see your point in stating why illegal immigrants are bad the 116 billion dollars per year they drain from a system i am taxed to pay for would be a start the fact that they are coming here in large numbers and suppressing wages by artificially inflating the supply of labor well beyond what our economy produces naturally is another also the fact that they are much more likely to commit serious crimes and are vastly overrepresented in prison systems whereas legal immigrants are underrepresented i could keep going but lets not pretend like illegal immigration doesnt cause harm it does ________________________________ gt but the sign essentially says dont eat at mexican restaurants because they take our jobs did you not read where i said that this sign is stupid offers no solutions and targets the wrong people i just said i empathize with someone whos feeling displaced by illegals in their own country ___________________________ gtlets assume a worst case where an illegal immigrant opens a restaurant and hires all illegals how were there any jobs taken from anyone it competes against other restaurants who are following the rules and gets customers that could have been spending their money at an establishment that operates within the bounds of the law you are just not understanding that suppressed wages doesnt necessarily mean less jobs it means lower paying jobs and suppressed wages doesnt happen because of just 1 restaurant hiring illegals its an effect that happens when we have 10s of millions of illegals working in the country all competing in the marketplace to lower wages across the board labor is a commodity the cost of which is dictated by supply and demand thats why its harmful to allow millions of illegals to flood our labor markets looking for work thats why we need to enforce limits on the number of people that we take and not allow cheaters to bypass those limits by sneaking into the country,0,1

todayilearned,the science of hadith is based on 8th and 9th century scholarship and even those scholars acknowledge that their system is flawed and shouldnt be viewed as infallible it wasnt until the 1800s did hadith gain their current view where strong hadith were deemed infallible even the most accurate hadith were passed orally for 200 years after the prophet died before being compiled hadith have also been questioned since the earliest days of islam and the reason they became accepted by muslims as a standard is because islamic governments used hadith as a way to legitimize their legal structures hadith help to gain a historical perspective on islam and the life of muhammad but to accept them as absolute is blindly following and islam tells us to think first and examine history hadith causes a ton of injustices in the modern muslim world even though they contradict each other and almost half of them were proven to be fabricated,0,1

AmItheAsshole,yta amp i get that people dont think talking to the parents would have accomplished anything but bare minimum talking to them from the get go would have at least provided the parents with feedback for the parents it would appears that after 17 months from october 2018 to february 2019 of the same volume level maybe not frequency but i do not know how many parents remember how often their baby cried every dayweekmonth their neighbor has gone mental and is now screaming obscenities at them and then to have that same neighbor call cps less than 2 months later seems insane amp a conversation with the neighbor could have worked out a compromise between the families hey i changed my schedule and am home a lot more during the day and the crying seems more pronounced at the moment is there a schedule or times you know there will be crying so i can try to plan around it ltlt like if the baby is being sleep trained and you know it goes down for a nap at 2pm then you can choose to be elsewhere then so you dont have to listen to it amp or hey neighbor ive been trying to be patient cause i know raising babies is hard but the noise level is really affecting my life and something needs to be done can you sound proof your apartment the baby room so the noise doesnt travel as much amp or hey i dont know if you know how loud the crying is up in my apartmentcondo but its really affecting me how can we resolve this  this is the step i would have taken first cause sound travels so strangely i can have music on in my cubicle at a low level im barely hearing it and its like a 215 on the volume scale but the cubicle 30 feet away on a diagonal can hear it perfectly as if it was a 515 and right at their desk the cubicle on the opposite side can hear it louder than i hear it at my desk and im right next to it so its possible that the parents while still aiming for no crying dont realize how the sound is amplified in ops space,1,1

asoiaf,all the amazing things youre listing were accidents she didnt do any of them on purpose except save jon she backed stannis but she didnt tell him to save jon because hes the one he wanted to have a stark loyal to him to get northmans support for him fight for the throne yes jon raised the army danys army really to fight against the dead hes the only one in the show whos been fighting for the bulk of the show against the nk the prophecies of the show and book support jon or dany as the one to end the long night honestly i dont even really care about the prophecies in th show but its stupid to have a character like arya who until this episode hasnt see a wight or white walker suddenly kill the nk bcuz she a cool assassin it subverts our characters arcs whats jon supposed to do now bran beans already done nothing really but he was supposed to explain more about the nk and what the duck is really happening well that doesnt really matter anymore and probably wont be revealed its similar to aryas or jaimes arc of being against cersei how dumb would it be for pod the rod to end up killing her or sam or gilly no matter how cool they could show it goes against everything the narrative has set up in a bad way but it subverted expectations i agree subverting exasperations are important especially for a drama but this wasnt subverting expectations it was throwing them out the window truest subverting expectations would be jon fighting the nk in hand to hand sword to sword combat soon jon is overwhelmed by his monstrous and otherworldly strength longclaw is knocked from his hands and jon knocked to the ground and right before the nk takes an forever to make his killing blow jon yells to dany who tearfully says dracarys igniting them both this assuming the writers decide t make dragonfire lethal would be subverting expectations because nobody would assume thats going to happen and yes dragonfire should be lethal considering dragonfire is said to be used to create valyrian steel the show runners decided 3 years ago that arya would kill him so its not surprising they decided to make dragonfire unable to kill him to explain why it has to be arya but i digress the show has been a generic tv drama since season 6 its wrong of us to expect anything good from the show anymore,0,1

soccer,sturridge and origi both might be out of the door imo sturridge almost certainly love him but hes never properly found a place in how klopp plays  probably the injuries have done that though origi i think is far too inconsistent as a backup  he can sometimes do alright off the bench but whenever he starts hes just quite ineffective brewster as backup would be nice if the injuries havent set him back that far or maybe another cheap but experienced striker in camacho looked rather poor at full back and i think i vaguely remember him not liking playing there so i cant see a place for him hoever is far too young at the moment imo so again i wouldnt mind seeing another experienced centre back coming in for depth and a left back to compete with robbo but will largely just sit on the bench if im honest in terms of other youth players who might step up  it seems that woodburn has somewhat regressed since he debuted so i reckon hell be out on loan again at this stage i dont think hes good enough to be a reliable backup would very much like to see what wilson can do in amongst the first team and i reckon hell be quite prominent in our pre season fixtures curtis jones i know is fairly highly rated but outside of 1 cup game he hasnt really sniffed the first team yet so not sure about him think the key is that even though there are a few highly rated young academy players around the squad i dont think most are at a level yet where we can rely on them to fill gaps in the squad or rest players so well definitely need to bring some good players in that are happy enough to not get the majority of minutes or to fight for rotation like shaqiri was planned to be but yeah hes sort of not on it at the moment,0,2

asoiaf,1 there was no alternative there was no point in trying to wait them out since they did not require food and never sleep the only chance was to try draw the night king out and kill him 2 the battles of hardhome and the frozen lake showed the undead moving as a scattered uncoordinated mass who basically just shambled along until they caught sight of a living person then they would rush forward singularly and try to grapple them ignoring other people further back for the most immediate target they assumed that they would fight in the same way at winterfell and so the combined forces would stand a good chance of holding them off whilst dany and jon ambush and kill the night king it was part of a deliberate strategy to make it appear as though the castle was undefended and vulnerable 3 the undead horde normally moves with a great many gaps and spaces present which would allow cavalry to ride through the artillery was most likely intended to create further openings for the dothraki they had to be situated wellforward to launch their projectiles just ahead of the cavalry charge 4 there was constant ongoing missile fire it was being continually launched by individual archers rather than as massive volleys you can see arrows flying as the undead are standing before the fire trench 5 the darkness and surrounding forests made it impossible for the dothraki to act as mounted archers flanking would not have worked either as the undead cannot be panicked into fleeing which is what flanking attacks are partly intended to do given that the dothraki would refuse to act as infantry the only viable way to use them as to charge this was only done because it was assumed the wights would fight as they did in the past the dothraki could ride through the gaps slashing with their dragonglass arakhs and once they left the horde could either continue riding drawing a lot of the wights off target any white walkers if they saw them or reform and charge again 6 they did not have much time to engage in more extensive defensive works that would encompass the army and still allow them enough space to retreat,1,0

asoiaf,the problem with listing aryas qualifications for this is that everyone else who is trained to fight except maybe sam is supposed to be a better fighter in show and plainly are in tbe books most by skill alone but all by physical advantage shes literally a little girl with a little sword her combat kills with it are extremely few and under select circumstances the only thing that is supposed to set arya aside from the two dozen far better larger fighters is ability to assassinate people however thats entirely irrelevant here the faceless men dont kill people by dropping off roofs and stabbing them their entire schtick literally represented in the name is the ability to disguise themselves as friendlies to bypass any security this is how they take out high priority targets that nobody else can it involves denying and destroying the concept of a self identity becoming nobody so that you can become anyone arya fails this training because shes fundamentally a stark but gets the power anyway and is sent on her way because jaqen is a nice guy inexplicably ok in the show the ninja training if you can call stick fighting that starts once dampd had decided arya would kill the night king maybe we can say that here she learns how to use her other senses better thats fair but she doesnt use a sword again at all until the waif comes for her head and thats where the payoff of being experienced fighting with restricted vision is lets ignore the whole grievious wounding and swim in the poo canal yet when she comes back to westeros shes beating brienne arguably the best knight in existence since jaimes hand was cut off in a swordfight all because dampd were setting her up for the night king its a contrived joke where the character suddenly changes because the plot needs them to be different for x event down the line but lets say arya has trained and fairly earned her skills for the sake of argument even then theres absolutely nothing to suggest the night king is a good fighter or that anything about him necessitates that any particular skill is needed to strike him aside from his bodyguard squad and his ability to raise wights on the spot to stop a single pursuer in their tracks for which we literally had a group of the nations greatest warriors gathered with super rare valyrian steel weapons right fucking there theres no reason this could not have happened of course though they did nothing so that arya could have yet another kill handed to her and of course the way it played out had nothing to do with her syriohoundfaceless men training as some of her previous scenes did she teleports out of nowhere onto his back or was it a jetpack it seems she was trained by littlefinger rather than syrio and the blade drop is more of a bronn move hell a sand snake move in any case with the superhuman reflexes and strength he has previously displayed arya should have died the second the night kings hand closed around her throat i appreciate your effort to make sense of a crazy decision truly but i think here its best to just take the writers word for it it was done because they thought it would be cool and unexpected,1,1

teenagers,gtwhat if its necessary to ensure the survival of the parent this is rare but if it is the case i think abortion is allowed as an option for them gt what if the condom breaks well too bad they took that risk when they decided to have sex dont want to be pregnant dont have sex it really is simple gt what if the parents are too young or poor to support the baby and ensure it doesnt live a life of misery a life is better than no life sure it may not but as great as others but its a life which is better than being aborted what if they are too poor i dont know if a poor familys kid broke some expensive vase or something in a store the poor family still has to pay for it that family is responsible for that kid and if they cant pay for children than they should have taught that kid to understand the risks of sex amp im not going to expand on the part of a brain of a fetus not in action as someone else covered that in these replies and im not educated enough on that part to argue it even though i disagree and one more topic i want to say because i feel it is used too much is rape if a woman was raped and got pregnant and wants an abortion sorry but that shouldnt be allowed either now i know that the rapist is almost fully the one to blame for the crime but i feel the victim shares a small amount of responsibility for rape dont get me wrong it was entirely the rapists fault but i feel that the victim should put up a fight or call for help heck even bring pepper spray with you places even as a early teen if some pedo rapist rapes you you should have some way of fighting whether it be with someone or have even pepper spray the worlds tuff just dont go alone unless you know you are safe which many places are just dont get yourself in a situation where rape occurs i know this comment is really lengthy but i really wanted to bring these points out amp edit formatting,0,0

news,but youre generalizing us firearms culture a very broad category and id argue that a significant percentage of that culture agrees that firearms are not to be treated like toys nearly everyone i know that owns a firearm understands the main tenants of always treating a firearm as if its loaded keep your finger out of the trigger well until youre ready to fire and the like sure theres absolutely the outliers that give everyone else a bad name but does that not exist in every demographic its easy to make blanket statements because the dipshits who treat firearms like toys are generally the ones trying to prove themselves as tough through outward displays gun control has become such a heated issue largely because its not approached intelligently and rationally kneejerk reactions like my home state of ct banning vaguelydefined assault rifles after sandy hook are not grounded in research in any capacity but are simply the easiest way to make the vocal majority happy i support background checks and other measures implemented to make sure someone is of sound mind and motive to acquire a firearm but outright bans is justthe lazy way out youre only punishing lawabiding citizens no one ever said shit well i was going to shoot up the mall but now that ar15s are illegal im having second thoughts we should be treating and addressing the cause of people committing mass murders with mental health programs reversing the detrimental effects of ancient toxic masculinity attitudes etc but those are much more difficult to address and require actual work so fuck it ban the weapon its the problem not the fact that the kids high school ignored him being bullied 3xweek,1,1

asoiaf,arya does have the training more so than anybody else who is better trained or equipped at oneonone combat that arya the assassin the problem with the nk kill imo is first they just wanted to feed us a curve ball and didnt care if a recurring plot point through out the whole series took a hit for somebody who just started watching in s6 or s7 its not that big of a problem but for people who have been following from the beginning it just feels very cheap they spent 8 seasons building up jon as the antink then at literally the very last moment they give it to arya instead that is why it feels so cheap build up all this tension between two characters then have an outside force come out of nowhere and end it it feels very unsatisfying amp maybe if our heroes had fought the ww instead of getting dog piled by wights over and over and over and magically every single one of them surviving it would have been more believable the nk should have been alone not surrounded by his generals a very very easy thing to solve and that was my biggest problem with the episode the writing was absolutely horrendous if you want sam on the front lines instead of defending the crypts where he should be than you damn well better be prepared to write him off and kill him which they werent they were clearly so afraid of backlash of people losing their favorite character they went out of their way to ensure everybody survives and pissed everybody off because they didnt lose their favorite characters it wasnt believable in the slightest,0,2

worldnews,im tired of these reddit comments pointing only the faults out of america  so ducking cliché and over posted on this site youre not a philosopher or rebel like you think you are you are apart of the majority generic opinion on here when it comes to talking about american foreign policy consist mostly of young americans who dont vote probably and europeans and chinese but hey lets not talk about china with north koreans having concentration camps or syria gassing more children than saudi arabia or any country in the middle east combined lets not talk about that cause that shows how america has higher standards in the governance of the world yea every anti american logic commentary on reddit i get it how just because other countries do it worse doesnt make what america does great but im just saying show me a country that does it better its so fucking easy to sit on your high chair and just look down on mistakes of america when you take it out of the context and dont compare it to countries similar to its size what your saying is so like one sided it takes no account of how other countries of americas scale rule the worldzero you want business with a country with backward standards for its citizens having more influence in the word its crazy criticize america but you know it does a better job than the other two next in line at leading the world russians also support propped up dictatorships in the middle eastsyria ring a bell to you what about north korea with china  i fucking love it when people criticize america for this shit but if they compare it to russia or any other country close to americas power they soon realize what america does isnt right but it sure as hell has higher standards than russians and chinese and does a better job is it because of americas free press and strong rights for its citizens or about mini governments within the american government and the governments with in it constantly checking each other  executive legislative judicial   the courts are amazing in america and are the best in the world btw for its citizens  all these things china and russia dont have and thats my answer for why they do a worse job at leading the world with syria and north korea being great example sure saudi arabia is bad but so is a power vacuum and more governments like syria with lower standards for citizens are you about tell me chinese and russians treat their citizens better thats a good laughfrom mass organ harvesting and its treatment of minorities in the west china is so bad at standards for its own fucking people let alone the people of countries it wants to be involved inthats a scary nightmareand at ruling its people and the standards they have are behind usa and europe usa may do poor foreign policy actions but it was done because we thought it helped inferior governments of the russians and chinese have less influence over the world and other inefficient governments of the world look how they treat their own citizens,0,1

soccer,gt the problem with this system is that without past limitations on how many foreigners you can select any league with 4 teams in the champions league each year will draw in massively more money and fame and players from the smaller leagues making the distance between those leagues only grow bigger like in any capitalist country you can build on your success if you dont like that concept go to live to communist cuba gt look at the dutch league its exceptional what ajax does this season but next season all their star players will have left to one of the major leagues and we can wait another 15 years to perform this well in the cl thats because the champions league is not the most profitable and most predominant competition in europe epl gives around 125 million to epl teams on average per year just for being in the epl if the champions league paid like on average 250 million per year to champions league teams ajax would be able to keep more players the champions league have to generate more money how do you do that you need more matches and they have to be interesting nobody wants to watch the kosovo champion against real madrid the kosovo champion will be able to compete against real madrid when the kosovo league gets high in the uefa rankings and as a reward they will also be given more spots for european competitions gt and to be honest maybe less people from the major league countries would watch the cl but other countries will probably draw way more viewers the champions league is already more popular in all european countries gt they just do not generate enough income for the eufa so they stick to the current system since lets face it its about money not about sport any league can get to the top 4 if they suck its not uefas problem as i said before countries like romania are being held back by their weak economies not by uefa gt myself i am hardly interested in the cl anymore once the dutch teams are out its hardly special anymore watching the same clubs play each other every year you are the exception people want to watch the best against the best the champion of a shitty league facing real madrid in the group stage would not be watched by anyone if you want to be in the cl you have to earn it and winning a league of parttime mcdonalds workers is not earning it leagues are part of the equation too dont forget that by the way barcelona and liverpool didnt face each other in a competitive match in 12 years thats a very fresh matchup,0,0

dankmemes,the point isnt to solve the problem its to learn the method theyre teaching there will be plenty of times when the method is important to know even though the problem can be solved another way an example is using ladder operators vs solving the differential equation for energyangular momentum eigenvalues in quantum mechanics solving the differential equation works great until you get to more complicated wave functions at which point you need to use ladder operators so if youre given a proofofconcept problem asking you to find the different energy eigenvalues of a particle using ladder operators it defeats the entire purpose of the problem,0,1

ChapoTrapHouse,so the reality is that the overwhelming majority of sex work is coercive work performed out of economic necessity and overwhelmingly impacts already marginalized groups the idea of the bougie radlib horny sex worker who does it for love of sex is a sort of unicorn in that while sure it may exist i have neither the interest in proving it exists nor the evidence to point to its existence next to the issue of the woke johns who only engage with the sex workers mentioned above  how in the fuck would anybody be able to track this if there is a transaction of money at the end of it and the sex workers own body and their value of their own body has been reduced to it being a consumable good its really hard to imagine a world where the work isnt coercive at its core i wont argue the validity of sex therapy because at its root is the oversexed and massively pornified nature of our culture where sex and value are in my opinion inappropriately intertwined this is all to say that i think the ideas you presented are empty bags that prosex work people like to put all their hopes into,0,2

MortalKombat,that is prolly finally the best way to explain peoples upsets over it problem is you have fools that all they are so focused on and dont understand using tact to explain their point and wind up sounding idiotic and stereotypical with it i agree the excuses were dumb and they should have just said well this is what we wanted to do because we thought these looked cool thing is and i have come at a lot of these people arguing this design stuff and called them out to shout the stupid down in that they need to present a better argument and speak tactfully like one angry gamer and that yter infinite retro running around yelling we must defend boner culture and calling themselves the cleavage connoisseurs your not convincing anyone on your arguments acting that way and just makes you sound like a moron unfortunately way too many are doing that and just playing in the hands of those they claim to argue against because i called that stuff out they have called me an sjw and male feminist when i am far from it also your right people are just sick of buying a game and then having the game preach its devs politics at you when you just wanna play the game no one cares how much they hate the orange man and want diversity we just wanna escape real life for a while and enjoy out time away from it however i do think folks are getting a lil overboard with the responses lately jaxs ending is honestly 1 in 25 characters that gets political granted other character endings discuss slavery but its more in a fantasy realm and well follows an old fictional trope the maga joke with kahn is one single line of dialogue and it is funny to a point even both sides can laugh at it for the most part these things dont get in the games way ftr i actually do like the new designs for the females except cassies costumes they are god awful and i would like to at least see the classic designs for the females because the mk2 and mk3 costumes are iconic now and nostalgic i think boon made a better response than that art director did which he said he felt that they went too over then top in 9 and wanted to scale it back in x and 11 that art director was just an idiot that put his political foot forward first when talking about it and instead of trying to still sell the game with his words wanted to grandstand i do not know why these fools dont get put through a crash course in pr before they do interviews but its we also there is people still misrepresenting the games mtx and the grind in it when its nowhere near the nonsense it is claimed to be the only issue the game truly has that needs fixing is this horrid online requirement that ties the krypt and rewards to it that is just poor design choice imo these things are also def hurting the games sales too but i wont say its a get woke go broke thing either oh and give dvorah some damned buffs she is trash right now,0,1

funny,no problem let me explain in an internal combustion engine a mixture of fuel and air is burned in a closed cylinder forcing a piston to move up and down in a car the moving piston rotates a crankshaft which turns a driveshaft which supplies power to the wheels the fuel is consumed in the process and needs to be refilled every so often in order to keep using the vehicle this is usually done at gas stations where gas is pumped out of tanks stored below the ground and into the vehicle via an access hatch on the quarter panel of the car this fuel has become a valuable resource worldwide because it is a finite resource wars have been faught over this substance leading to it becoming even more valuable because of its value gas stations cannot give it away for free and thus require payment by the driver of the vehicle being refilled the traditional way for the gas station to specify which gas pump is occupied by a paying customer is to assign numbers to the pumps and then communicate that number when making the transaction now back to the first paragraph  remember when i said that this fuel burns that was a bit of an understatement the fuel burns extremely quickly and can cause massive explosions if ignited in the open air this makes transferring the fuel from the pump to the vehicle a potentially dangerous process in most states adults are able to safely handle this fuel transfer by themselves using logic reason and a general awareness of ones surroundings however in some states like new jersey  adult humans are unable to do this without help from a professional thus why you might not understand this humorous video which serves a remarkable resemblance to a common behavior when initializing the fuel transaction,0,2

Animemes,1 why are you repeating yourself i didnt say anything about the nature of depression how we define it or treat it all im going after is the cause 2 developed countries generally have significantly lower population overall than undeveloped or still developing countries birth rates are lower often below replacement i was basing it on percentages anyway so population doesnt actually matter 3 developed countries promote very different mental states and ways of thinking from other countries this comes from politics changes in cultural values and more demanding people politicians will endlessly spout how high everyones standard of living should be in attempts to win elections the culture shifts from working for family in a community to promising that if you go to school until your 26 youll get a wellpaying job and the money will make you happy family ends up coming 2nd often being discouraged and seen as something to hold off on of course the money doesnt make you happy and the desperation to have a family before you get too old starts setting in finally the people simply have higher expectations for their lives rather than focus on how good they have it compared to the rest of the world they look at celebrities with envy you can keep repeating how depression is a mental illness and yes it is officially labeled so yet treating it as such has done more harm than good the drugs given to treat depression make it worse in withdrawal along with other symptoms and side effects during use no one is born with depression hence i would consider it to be bother a mental illness bot an emotion but rather a mental state similar to pessimism,0,1

worldnews,gtnone of those are palestinian which is what i asked for or was your point that the palestinians never had a state palestinians are arabs and muslims and islamic states considering religious identify predates national identity have ruled those areas so no again you misconstrue a point gtbecause my point was that jews have lived there continuously and so have claims at least as strong as palestinian arabs do great so they should have a joint state secularly ruled by both peoples not a state that is explicitly jewish treating nonjews as pests to be eradicated gtno it isnt as much as you wish it was secular israelis do not rely on the bible for their claims they rely on thousands of years of jewish history ah so you have no issue then making israel a secular state where both jews and arabs are treated equally under the law then gtyou started this whole thing by claiming that the jewish deed to the land was revoked for rebelling and followed up by saying that the jebusite claim still exists again you seem to have an issue applying the morality of the time of the facts at hand to your analysis i didnt start the argument your representative to the unsc was the one justifying more israeli settlements pointing to the bible gtits a bit rich for you to now complain about anachronistic legal and moral conventions rich coming from people who support the jewish state of israel i agree justify a state using those conventions then get upset when neither those nor modern conventions justify your oppression gtplease id love to see you show me where i literally did gtno i am not i was pointing out that your attempt to claim that the jebusites have a better claim than jews do relies on the bible i fail to see how that is even relevant to anything i am saying are you suggesting that historians dont treat the bible as a historical source gtjews were offered it by the international community in the form of the league of nations and subsequently the un but again as i already said those propositions were rejected and never happened oh so by europeans glad we agree gtyes european powers wanted to divide the land but in reality that never happened instead jews had to defend themselves from an attempted arab genocide pathetic revisionism gtyes really nope gtit certainly is you claimed a history degree while omitting what areas and periods of time that degree is relevant to if your degree was in russian history or mediterranean history of an unrelated era then its totally irrelevant my studies were focused in the ancient to medieval era i have read and used josephuss account in a thesis and what are your credentials gtof course its irrelevant either way since weve established that you dont actually know the history degree or not man someone call phi alpha theta they made a mistake gtaccording to the bible a source you reject the jebusites ruled a small area around jerusalem when did i reject the bible gtand then by jews again i dont claim right by conquest though you apparently think that everyone but jews have been historically entitled to it but if you do then jews are still entitled to be there youll notice wwii is about the point that we stopped recognizing conquest as a rightful manner to take territory i wonder why that is but hey you are all welcome to change that the usa wont be here much longer to support you gtim aware of this and havent contradicted it it was you who claimed that the jebusites still have rights to the land you should work on your reading comprehension gtyou have a tendency to project onto others right back at you buddy gtyouve claimed that europeans gave the land to the jews which is just plain false nope palestine was part of the british mandate after wwi they controlled it until they surrendered it to you that is the fact gtyouve claimed that jews lost their rights for rebelling and that theyve expired after a 1900 year statute of limitations that you invented but also that the jebusites somehow have a stronger claim if you take my comments out of context and suffer from reading comprehension issues sure i fairly clearly laid out the issues but clearly you lack the background to properly analyze them gtand youve claimed that i rely on the bible for my arguments which is just pure fantasy i think you need to step back because frankly you are making zero sense im fairly certain you dont even know what the article was about let me remind you gtthe bible is a deed to land of israel settlement envoy tells unsc this isnt about you you replied to my response to that argument i didnt respond to yours it is hilarious doesnt read the article and then bitches about my lack of knowledge typical and keep making this personal it just proves to me you have zero actual arguments to stand on but seriously thanks for the laugh,0,1

worldnews,the us is involved yes but its not the reason venezuela is collapsing the us is involved in every world issue out there however its in retreat from the world at this stage the notion of american primacy has begun to fall out of favor and there is no appetite for heavy handed involvement on the world stage merely soft power you cant just point to the 70s and 80s forever and imply the government is exactly the same iraq and afghanistan caused a real shift in domestic politics the cia is nothing like it was the cold war as it was is over and ultimately latin america isnt a focus for american foreign policy right now you act like i dont understand our history in foreign affairs but its actually one of my main areas of interest i just dont pretend that things are the same as they were many decades ago  much has changed in whats politically acceptable and frankly latin america just isnt really on our radar much anymore the libya example is funny because a france started that campaign b the other option was another syria but regardless i would be very surprised if even trump authorized a invasion going into an election year that would probably be the easiest way for him to guarentee an election loss theres a significant portion of his base that does not want more foreign intervention,0,1

marvelstudios,i like what jeffrey said but to me theres a different explanation the hammer is supposed to be a conduit but thor doesnt even seem to use many lightning powers before ragnarok hinting that its something like an enchantment on a wand which is the hammer my reason to this is that the hammer says that whomever holds it wields the power of thor which in this case means it pulls power from some place like the weave for dnd nerds to grant the power also the hammer is just an uru metal weapon uru isnt magical but it holds greater potency for it as a lens hence the powerup with stormbreaker when thor channels his own power through it in the case of the hammer its not left unenchanted acting as a lens but instead is enchanted with a protective guard for the worthy and the channel of lightning i can keep going but i feel like ill just make less and less sense and obviously because its not explicitly stated take what you will for how you want to think of it,0,1

asoiaf,yeah im pretty sure grrm hashad no idea how the others were going to be defeatedstopped beyond jon and daenerys join forces and defeat them in his outline to dampd about the ending because if it had been jonjorahjaimewhoever has to stab daenerysbrienne in the heart and suddenly his sword lights on fire and hes azor ahai and he fights an epic duel with the great other until he finally wins thats what they would have done amp i do think grrm gave them a basic shape of the ending these main characters live these main characters die heres the details of how a few of them die heres what the political situation is have at it he didnt give them but a few specific details like shireen being burned jons real parentage hodors origin etc amp i mean if im being brutally honest what were seeing looks like a more writ large version of what we saw when jon was revealed to be legitimate last season and to a lesser extent when jons true parentage was revealed a whole lot of people that are angry the version of the story they devised in their heads didnt turn out to be accurate happens with almost anything that gains this large and widespread of a fandomeventually it reaches a tipping point where people somehow feel cheated if their preferred version of the story doesnt pan out amp and sure we can criticize hollywood battle tactics and the desire for drama and entertainment over absolute realism until were blue in the face but i dont really feel like thats the true source of all the animus here and elsewhere,1,1

asoiaf,what frustrates me about these complaints is that arya is not the dues ex machina the dues ex machina is say that if the night king dies all enemies die and then having him willingly come to where our heroes are before they are all dead no matter who killed him at that point it would have been a dues ex machina there are other complaints i can entertain about arya being the one to do it but literally none of them have to do with her being a dues ex machina she is literally the opposite if we want to assume that anybody is going to beat somebody that is supposed to be the most powerful being alive then absolutely the most realistic person would be the one who has trained for years to master the art of subversion anybody beating him in an actual one on one fight would have been far more unrealistic than arya getting a cheap shot in and all of this ignores that arya had literally zero part in setting up the events as they were that goes solely to jon and dany if it werent for them there would have never been a resistance that they could have stupidly used to bring about a scenario where it would be possible for a faceless man to get a killing blow on the night king even in the show i dont think arya is meant to be our azor ahai there was a lot wrong about the episode but i feel most complaints are less nuanced than what we actually got in the show i also just think so many people saying prophecy was ruined is ridiculous how was prophecy ruined because arya dealt the final blow the blow that she had literally zero involvement in bringing about she was the tool but this was jons victory this is danys victory everything that happened here happened because of them this is how prophecy is actually fulfilled you guys for some reason want the straight fantasy method of having our promised one be the one that plunges his sword into the heart of darkness but the whole point of this series is delivering you those fantasy tropes through a vein of realism well here is your realism jon and dany have fulfilled the prophecy in that everything theyve done since the start of the series is what has made this battle possible literally none of this could have happened unless everything in their storylines happened the way it did and yet you guys think this is breaking prophecy because your shining prince wasnt the one to swing the sword at the end for fucks sake i feel like the reason i like this series is very different than the reasons everybody else likes this series and i just cant stand some of these complaints and i dont know why people cant see that melisandre got her conclusions about who azor ahai is wrong but that doesnt mean she was wrong in how those individuals were important to the lord of lights plan stannis wasnt azor ahai either but he was essential in setting up the realms of men to win in the battle for the dawn,1,2

gameofthrones,i get the idea of the nk and the ww they were created by the cotf as a weapon against the first men for whatever reason the cotf lost control of their weapon aka skynet my disappointment is how it was just such a black evil no apparent other motivations explained beyond senseless killing despite the inconsistencies that pure killing zombies would exhibit for example a emotionless death machine wouldnt smile would stop to stare at bran would just kill him immediately why did the nk need to be the one to kill him if it was just senseless death to all any wight or ww would have done just as good a job but nope had to be the nk that they were stealing babies to turn into ww and why did they need to carry the baby we saw all the way north to that shrine these things all lead to there being something more to them that for whatever reason was completely ignored they were just left as a cliche black evil with no shades of grey grrm created the series to not be black and white good vs evil but that is exactly how it has evolved,0,2
